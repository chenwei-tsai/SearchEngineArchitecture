# Search Engine Architecture

This is a search engine architecture project maintained by Barry and Shawn

## Goal

The goal is to build a machine learning news topic classifier. We are going to write a few crawlers to crawl news articles from a few new source websites, and use the news articles crawled from The New York Times as our news topic training data. Hopefully in the end we could use the model we build to automatically classify all the news articles we crawled.
