Finally satisfied with the results, Ms. Forley now sells a line of crisp, yet delicate kiss-shaped vegan meringues in flavors like chocolate, vanilla, maple, raspberry rose and orange blossom. She drizzles some with dark chocolate; others come in pretty boxes mixed with dried fruit and flowers. Keep them in mind for Mother\u2019s Day: Meringues, $12 and up, boxed, 914-491-9205, meringueshop.com."}
