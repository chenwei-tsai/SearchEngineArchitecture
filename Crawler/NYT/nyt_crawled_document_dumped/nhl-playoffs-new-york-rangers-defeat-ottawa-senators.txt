T. Miller charged into the Ottawa Senators\u2019 zone late in the second period Tuesday night, and the puck stayed on his stick blade as he whirled at the top of the circle to drop one defender, and it stayed there as he juked past another, and it stayed there even as he fended off a check and zoomed toward the net. Miller controlled the puck for a good five seconds, weaving through a discombobulated defense, and he gave it up only when he was ready. Miller\u2019s pass resulted in a goal for the Rangers \u2014 and of course it did, because his team, after opening an Eastern Conference semifinal series with two narrow defeats, played as if it had spent the past three days reliving its foibles and vowing never to repeat them. By winning, 4-1, powered by a resurgent Henrik Lundqvist and goals from four players on four lines, the Rangers avoided the prospect of careening to the edge of oblivion. Only four times in N.H.L. history had a team won a best-of-seven series after losing the first three games. The Rangers still trail Ottawa, two games to one, but in their return to Madison Square Garden, the Rangers deployed a brand of hockey that eluded them on the road, and one that exposed the Senators at every turn. They played with speed, verve and discipline, not only neutralizing Ottawa\u2019s star defenseman, Erik Karlsson, but also exploiting him: The Rangers\u2019 final three goals, including Oscar Lindberg\u2019s tally off that feed from Miller, came with Karlsson on the ice. \u201cThere is no question, I think, that we were the better team tonight,\u201d Lundqvist said. Until this point in the series, the answer to that question had not been clear. The rhetoric emanating from the dressing rooms Tuesday morning revolved around a singular theme: luck. The Senators profited from it, believing they were fortunate to have won the first two games. The Rangers lacked it, believing that their performance in Ottawa had merited a split. \u201cBut I think if you think that way,\u201d Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi said, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be in a little bit of trouble.\u201d As for what the Rangers were actually thinking, it was difficult to discern. Mika Zibanejad, who assisted on Mats Zuccarello\u2019s opening goal, said only that there were \u201ca lot of words\u201d that could describe how they needed to play. One possibility, however simple: better. If that was the Rangers\u2019 goal, they succeeded. Instead of chasing the puck, the Rangers started with it, and they swarmed in Ottawa\u2019s zone. Nine shots pelted Craig Anderson in the first nine minutes, with others skittering wide, and these were superb chances \u2014 one-timers from the slot, wristers from the circle and rebounds near the crease. The Senators had bemoaned the five goals they ceded in Game 2, and their defensive lapses remained unresolved as the Rangers took advantage. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should change a lot,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that we should feel really good about.\u201d With room to skate, the Rangers seized control, first on the ice, and then on the scoreboard. They went ahead at 5 minutes 31 seconds of the first period, when Zuccarello, stationed low between the circles, converted a nifty centering pass from Zibanejad. On the pass, Zibanejad circled the net and fended off the 6-foot-6-inch rookie defenseman Ben Harpur, who had the reach but not the speed to keep up. The Rangers abused him later in the period, when Zuccarello wheeled the puck around the boards, behind the net, in the general direction of Michael Grabner. It evaded Anderson, who left the crease to play the puck, and also Harpur, who could have stopped it, or advanced it, but did neither. Grabner wrapped around and tucked the puck in the net at 13:24. The Rangers led by two goals for the first time since all the way back in Game 2, which they bungled in the final 3:19 of regulation before losing in double overtime. Every playoff, it seems, Lundqvist entitles himself to a dud, a game when he surrenders rebounds or does not track the puck well or move with grace, and the result reflects it. His six goals allowed matched a playoff worst. But almost always, he regroups for the next game. In front of him, the Rangers\u2019 defense cleared screens and allowed him to see the shooter. Rarely tested, Lundqvist most likely never noticed the lone blemish \u2014 a behind-the-back pass from Bobby Ryan to Jean-Gabriel Pageau by the cage \u2014 until it was behind him. By then, though, the Rangers led, 4-1. Ottawa anticipated the Rangers\u2019 desperation, and even embraced it. Its coach, Guy Boucher, proffered not embellishment, but a fair characterization of the circumstances Tuesday when he said that in a few hours, his team would play its toughest game of the season.
