But Boardroom Spirits, a craft distiller in Lansdale, Pa., also distills its from vegetables. It has produced a spirit from beets, and its latest is from carrots. It takes about 12\u00bd pounds of fermented and distilled carrots for a 375-milliliter bottle. Nothing else is added. The bouquet and the flavor carry a musky whiff of sweet carrot. Drop a generous splash along with a few drops of orange bitters in a flute of prosecco, add a carrot-stick muddler, and you have a spring cocktail, or sip it after dinner, alongside some fresh goat cheese: Boardroom Spirits C, $30 for 375 milliliters, boardroomspirits.com."}
