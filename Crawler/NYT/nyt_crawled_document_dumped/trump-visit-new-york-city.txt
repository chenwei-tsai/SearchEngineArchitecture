Earlier in the week, flight restrictions announced by the Federal Aviation Administration indicated that President Trump would spend Thursday night in the city after a dinner reception aboard the U.S.S. Intrepid on the West Side of Manhattan. He would then travel the next day to his country house in New Jersey, at the Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster. But new restrictions announced Tuesday showed Mr. Trump heading straight to Bedminster from the Intrepid. The New York Police Department said it had been advised that Mr. Trump would not be staying in the city. He is expected to stay in Bedminster through the weekend. At least one protest scheduled to take place outside Trump Tower, by the New York State Immigrant Action Fund and the New York Immigration Coalition, will go on as planned, said Steven Choi, the fund\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe president can\u2019t even face the music in his own building?\u201d he said. \u201cNew York City is ready for him, and we\u2019ll be there.\u201d Mr. Trump has said in recent interviews that he hasn\u2019t returned to New York because of the high costs involved with his travel. \u201cGoing back is very expensive for the country,\u201d he said on Fox News on Friday. \u201cI hate to see the New Yorkers with streets closed.\u201d Mr. Trump is scheduled to fly to New York on Thursday afternoon and travel to the Intrepid, the decommissioned aircraft carrier docked in the Hudson River off West 46th Street, where he will meet Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. The event is a reception and dinner to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, when the two countries fought alongside each other against Japan. The reception on the Intrepid begins at 6:30 p.m., with dinner to follow, and by then, judging by social media, protests outside will have been well underway. Several groups announced protests and marches near the Intrepid before the reception. Two groups, the Working Families Party and Rise and Resist, self-described as \u201cnew and experienced activists committed to opposing, disrupting and defeating any government act that threatens democracy, equality and our civil liberties,\u201d planned to gather separately on streets north and south of the aircraft carrier and march toward each other. Some protests incorporated the whimsical, with reminders that Thursday is also Star Wars Day (May the Fourth) and suggestions that participants dress accordingly. Other marchers were asked to wear white and to bring pots and pans to bang. \u201cWe want to get as close as possible so they hear us inside,\u201d said Nelini Stamp of the Working Families Party. That may prove difficult. In early September, as the presidential campaign entered its final weeks, Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton visited the Intrepid for a forum moderated by Matt Lauer of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, and security was tight, with pedestrian barriers radiating outward for blocks. New York City police declined to provide specific details regarding road closings and the managing of protests near the Intrepid during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit. The event on the Intrepid, now a sea, air and space museum, is being hosted by the American Australian Association. \u201cThe guests of honor for the evening are seven surviving veterans from the Battle of the Coral Sea \u2014 three Americans and four Australians,\u201d said John Berry, the group\u2019s president. \u201cThey\u2019re all in their mid 90s.\u201d The Australian veterans spent up to 28 hours traveling to New York for the event, a black-tie affair for 700 guests that is open to the press, Mr. Berry said. Dinner includes steak and sea bass, and Mr. Trump and Mr. Turnbull are expected to make remarks. Much of the neighborhood around the Intrepid still bears the industrial, worn facade of its nickname, Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Residents greeted news of the event in their backyard with mostly bemused irritation about how it might affect their business or commute. Mr. Trump lost overwhelmingly in Manhattan in last year\u2019s election, and some showed lingering antipathy toward the president on Tuesday. \u201cI guess it will be good to see him off the golf course,\u201d said Paul Masters, a salesman at Grand Cru Wine and Spirits, a few blocks from the museum. \u201cBut I hate we miss the irony. It would have been much better if he came the next day \u2014 for Cinco de Mayo.\u201d John Khe, 24, a Pakistani immigrant who operates a pretzel cart across the street from the Intrepid, said he would be forced to take the day off since the museum will be closed to the public. \u201cThe N.Y.P.D. would move me around too much, and all of those V.I.P. people wouldn\u2019t buy from me anyway,\u201d he said. But he said it was for a good cause. \u201cTrump is my guy,\u201d Mr. Khe said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a reason. I just like him.\u201d"}
