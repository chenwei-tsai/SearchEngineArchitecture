He was 70. His death was confirmed on Tuesday by Investigator Eric Sliz of the Fulton County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office in Atlanta. Mr. Hampton, who for years called himself \u201ccolonel\u201d before officially adding the abbreviated title to his name in 2000, collapsed on stage at the Fox Theater in the waning moments of a concert in honor of his 70th birthday, according to news reports and a family statement posted on Twitter through the Tedeschi Trucks Band, whose members were in attendance. The concert, billed as \u201cHampton 70: A Celebration of Col. Bruce Hampton,\u201d was coming to a close with an encore performance of the song \u201cTurn On Your Love Light\u201d when he collapsed, Blake Budney, manager of the Tedeschi Trucks Band, said in a telephone interview. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died, Mr. Budney said. . \u201cLast night marks both a tragic loss of one of the great musical and mystical heroes of our time, Col. Bruce Hampton, and a celebration of a man that influenced, nurtured, and pushed the boundaries of all musicians and human beings who were lucky enough to enter his welcoming and inspirational sphere,\u201d the band said Tuesday in a statement on its Facebook page. Mr. Hampton was born April 30, 1947, according to public records and a biography posted by Terminus Records, which lists him as one of its artists. He grew up in Atlanta, according to that biography. He first gained attention in the late 1960s and early \u201970s as the leader of the avant-garde Hampton Grease Band, which The New York Times labeled variously as \u201cone of the more cockeyed rock groups\u201d of the era and \u201ca mischievous, mystifying group.\u201d Critics, The Times wrote, called the band\u2019s music \u201ceclectic,\u201d meaning that it drew from a number of sources \u2014 and critics could not figure out what else to call it. The Hampton Grease Band opened for a number of prominent groups, such as the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers Band. But it also sometimes played practical jokes. The band once opened a concert for a pop-rock group by playing its own versions of that group\u2019s hits, according to a report in The Times. The move elicited boos, and the Hampton Grease Band responded with a lengthy encore. In the decades that followed, Mr. Hampton would lead, join or help form a number of other acts, including the Aquarium Rescue Unit, the Fiji Mariners and the Code Talkers. \u201cBruce Hampton is the 1970s rock star who wasn\u2019t: a comic, bearish, dadaist spieler with a deep Georgia accent, a Dali in the body of a Southern wrestler,\u201d The Times wrote in a 2001 review. Others labeled Mr. Hampton\u2019s music \u201csurrealist.\u201d In a video of an interview posted in June, he was asked who he was. In an absurdist answer, he replied with a laugh: \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of 103 people. I\u2019m not sure I exist.\u201d Friends and family said Mr. Hampton was also a mentor to many musicians, with a keen eye for talent. His influence on those musicians and his dedication to aiding their careers were perhaps the most lasting element of his legacy, they said. In a message posted on Facebook, James Forrest Hampton III identified himself as Mr. Hampton\u2019s nephew and said his uncle was also a doting relative. Mr. Hampton\u2019s survivors include his wife, Sara, and his brother, Jim. \u201cHe taught me how to be weird,\u201d James Hampton wrote in the message, \u201cand how weird was good.\u201d Many of Mr. Hampton\u2019s associates also noted the fortuitous but seemingly appropriate end to the musician\u2019s life. \u201cBruce was the only person I could think of who has ever played at his own funeral, because in essence, that\u2019s what he did,\u201d said Scott McKinney, a bluegrass musician known as Fudd who said in a telephone interview that he had known Mr. Hampton more than 20 years. \u201cBruce couldn\u2019t script it any better.\u201d", "abstract": "The career of the self-styled colonel spanned decades before what turned out to be a final show in Atlanta, a concert in honor of his birthday.", "title": "Bruce Hampton, 70, Jam Scene Patriarch, Dies After Collapsing on Stage", "source": "NYT", "time": "2017-05-02T22:51:29-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "section": "Arts"}
