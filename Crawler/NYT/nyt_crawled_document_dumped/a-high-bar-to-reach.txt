{"updated_date": "2017-05-02T22:00:25-04:00", "text": "WEDNESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Quip themes in crossword puzzles are tricky to pull off well; unless it\u2019s a really well-known quip, solvers might spend a lot of time solving around the quip until they get enough crossings to take a good guess at it. That can be frustrating to a solver, but hopefully the payoff of a humorous quip makes up for the extra hunting. Today\u2019s quip by Alan Arbesfeld might not be that well-known as far as I can tell, but if you like puns and other kinds of \u201cgroaner\u201d jokes, the payoff is definitely there. And by the time you work your way down to the punch line at 53A, you might even be able to guess the quip as a whole. Mr. Arbesfeld makes an observation about what happens when a DENTIST and a MANICURIST face off, and you can read the theme quip in its entirety here. As quip themes go, this is pretty good: It\u2019s tight and it\u2019s funny. It looks to me like it might have been a bit squashed to accommodate the symmetrical requirements of Mr. Arbesfeld\u2019s grid (I would have thought there might be an \u201cA\u201d before MANICURIST), but that didn\u2019t bother me much. A theme like this takes up a lot of real estate in the grid, though, which limits the surrounding fill. Mr. Arbesfeld makes the best of his situation by throwing in some Scrabbly letters, but I would have liked to have seen some more exciting fill in the shorter entries. POLE-VAULTER and TICKET TAKER, the long Downs, are pretty good, especially the clue for POLE-VAULTER, my favorite of the day). Today\u2019s cluing felt a bit on the easy side to me for a Wednesday, but that might have been done to accommodate the quip. Also, it\u2019s a wheelhouse thing; I just happened to be on Mr. Arbesfeld\u2019s wavelength today. \u25a0 42A: Remember, foreign-language clue = foreign-language answer. La Espa\u00f1ola is an island with a Spanish name, so the answer has to be in Spanish, and that\u2019s ISLA. \u25a0 43A: I wanted these to be ice skate blades, but the \u201cOlympic blades\u201d in today\u2019s puzzle are \u00c9P\u00c9ES. \u25a0 2D: Get to know the name ELIHU, because it has appeared 128 times in The New York Times Crossword, typically clued either as ELIHU Yale, who has caused some controversy of late for Yale University, or ELIHU Root, the statesman. Here\u2019s the answer key to today\u2019s puzzle.
