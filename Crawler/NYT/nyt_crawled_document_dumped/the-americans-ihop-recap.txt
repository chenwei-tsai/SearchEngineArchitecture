Four episodes left. Things got off to a good start in the opening credits: \u201cAnd Frank Langella.\u201d That wasn\u2019t even the best news: It was Frank Langella and Alison Wright, Gabriel and Martha, reunited for a doleful scene in her Moscow apartment. Back in the U.S.S.R. (so much for all that defection talk, commenters), Gabriel dropped by to see how she was doing and to tell her that \u201cClark\u201d was thinking about her. How was she doing? She was jobless because her Russian wasn\u2019t good enough, she wasn\u2019t meeting any suitable men and, despite her access to the better supermarkets, she was eating a baked potato. Bitter and all out of illusions, she told Gabriel to leave and never come back. Maybe Gabriel will keep turning up like a bad kopeck, but it sure felt like this was how we\u2019ll have to remember Martha \u2014 sitting alone in her dingy flat listening to Russian music on the radio. Throughout the episode, characters saw their illusions about the Soviet Union punctured or their suspicions confirmed. Listening to a tape of Kimmy\u2019s dad, the C.I.A.\u2019s Afghanistan guy, Philip learned that his country was using bioweapons in Afghanistan \u2014 perhaps the Lassa fever that he helped smuggle out. Stan learned what we already knew: that there had been K.G.B. agents in Thailand when his old boss, Gaad, was killed. Oleg, after being dragged in for questioning, may have learned how high the food-fraud network reaches. Did I say Kimmy? Yes, Philip is still going to the Breland house \u2014 weekly, if he\u2019s on the schedule Gabriel gave him \u2014 to switch the tapes in her father\u2019s briefcase. So we probably have to assume that for two seasons now he\u2019s also been pretending to be her much older boyfriend, Jim, and putting off having sex by claiming it\u2019s against his religion. His Kimmy situation was nicely summed up when, in celebration of her birthday, he sang \u201cForever Young\u201d: \u201cMay God bless you and keep you always ...\u201d (Always thoughtful, Kimmy asked about the \u201cson\u201d Philip cited in Season 3 as an excuse for Jim\u2019s religious conversion. So we had Philip, as Jim, lying about not seeing a fake son while not knowing that in real life he had recently missed seeing his real son.) Ms. Wright and Julia Garner (who plays Kimmy) weren\u2019t the only actresses making surprise returns: Christine Toy Johnson popped up as Gaad\u2019s widow, Linh, and was excellent in a tough scene with Noah Emmerich as Stan. Agent Wolfe had suggested to Stan that having proof that the K.G.B. murdered Gaad was a reason to rethink their stance on Oleg (which seemed abrupt \u2014 were they really that surprised by the news?). Agonized as always, Stan went to Linh and sketched out the Oleg situation, thinking that she\u2019d support his position that Oleg should still be left alone. But no: Gaad would want revenge, she said. If Stan gives the go-ahead for Operation Oleg, though, might it actually help his old K.G.B. frenemy? Because things already aren\u2019t going well in Moscow. The P.G.U., the Soviet foreign intelligence gathering branch, wants the names of every American Oleg came in contact with in Washington, a demand whose silly arbitrariness makes it all the more frightening. Then they brought up Stan and Nina. A later scene in which Oleg finally got the imprisoned Dmitri to give up a name \u2014 with a melodramatic quaver uncharacteristic of the series \u2014 seemed to indicate that it is, indeed, the grocery investigation that\u2019s causing Oleg\u2019s problems. (Nice doubly symbolic touch: Oleg handing the black marketeer a fresh apple.) The notion of religion kept floating up during the episode, most directly in a curious scene in which Philip met with a former contact of Gabriel\u2019s. When he arrived for the meeting, he discovered that the source was a Russian Orthodox priest. He had cryptic information to pass on about another priest\u2019s excessive drinking and his meetings with a Frenchman \u2014 if we\u2019ve heard about any of this before, please refresh my memory. Unlike Gabriel, Philip wasn\u2019t going to have time to hear the young priest\u2019s reports (his secular confessions), and perhaps that\u2019s a loose end that will come back to haunt our spies. In the meantime, the priest suggested that Philip try prayer \u2014 a great solace \u201cwhen you live this kind of life.\u201d All this, and we haven\u2019t gotten to the episode\u2019s two biggest bombshells \u2014 one from Elizabeth and Philip\u2019s real son and the other involving their pretend son. In his most forceful moment in five seasons, Henry, the budding genius, announced that he wanted to follow his friend Chris and attend boarding school in New Hampshire. (It was a fictitious school named St. Edward\u2019s which sounded a lot like the real St. Paul\u2019s in Concord.) Once again, the master spies are completely clueless about developments in their own home. Showing quite a bit of resourcefulness, Henry had already sent in an application and solicited a recommendation from Chris\u2019s father. His parents were outraged at being kept in the dark, with Philip sounding father-angry and Elizabeth spy-angry. When things calmed down \u2014 and after they made fun of the school as a pretentious country club \u2014 it was Elizabeth who was more copacetic about their child leaving. But maybe she was just thinking that having him 500 miles away would make things simpler. For evidence of how much trouble a child can be, there was Tuan. Dropping by to check up on him, Elizabeth found an empty house. When he didn\u2019t return that night, the team \u2014 Elizabeth, Philip, Marilyn and Norm \u2014 went into full surveillance mode. (This week\u2019s filmed-in-New York moment: the Cobble Hill Cinemas marquee in the background as Marilyn tailed him down Court Street in Brooklyn.) He was soon observed boarding a Greyhound for Harrisburg, Pa., which is almost a Simon and Garfunkel song. In Harrisburg they watched as he went into an International House of Pancakes, reason unknown. Back at the house in Washington, Philip threw Tuan against the wall and Elizabeth put a gun in his face. He had a story: He\u2019d been traveling out of state to make phone calls to his former foster family in Seattle, whose young son had leukemia. (Apparently he felt more tenderly toward them than he let on earlier in the season.) It sounded like a stretch, but they let him live. Elizabeth believed Tuan, her mini-me, and when Philip speculated that he might be screwing up on purpose in order to get sent home to Vietnam, she frowned and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not who he is.\u201d They\u2019d better hope she\u2019s right.", "abstract": "A lot of agita, but still not a lot of action on this week\u2019s episode.", "title": "\u2018The Americans\u2019 Season 5, Episode 9: Tuan on the Bus", "source": "NYT", "time": "2017-05-02T23:01:15-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Arts"}
