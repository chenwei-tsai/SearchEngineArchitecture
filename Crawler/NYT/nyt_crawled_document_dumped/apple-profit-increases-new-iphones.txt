The company said Tuesday that the number of iPhones sold globally fell 1 percent in the first calendar quarter, compared with the same period a year ago, although revenue rose to $52.9 billion as more customers bought the supersized, more expensive iPhone 7 Plus. Apple\u2019s net income per share rose more than 10 percent, as a result of cost-cutting, higher prices and the company\u2019s continuing program to buy back its stock. The first two calendar quarters are often sluggish for Apple as customers await new versions of products. But unusual expectations for the 10th anniversary iPhones, due in September, may have worsened the slowdown. \u201cPeople are waiting to see what\u2019s going on with the new iPhone,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. \u201cApple needs to make sure the next phone has that \u2018wow\u2019 factor.\u201d That will be particularly important in China, the world\u2019s largest smartphone market, where revenue fell 14 percent in the three months that ended April 1. The continuing poor results there dragged down brisk sales elsewhere, Apple executives said. \u201cWe gained market share in almost every country that we track,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, focused on several bright spots during a call with investors. Services grew 18 percent to $7 billion, and Mr. Cook said that customers were paying for 165 million active subscription services from Apple and third parties. \u201cApple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cOur active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits.\u201d Apple is awaiting the outcome of tax policy discussions in Washington. President Trump has proposed a major cut in the corporate tax rate and has suggested he would favor a reduction in taxes for money that American corporations hold abroad. The company had $257 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of April 1, and analysts estimated that about 90 percent of it was stashed overseas. A tax cut would be \u201cvery, very beneficial,\u201d Mr. Maestri said, but Mr. Trump\u2019s plan remains vague and has not yet been introduced as legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for us to speculate at this point in time what might happen,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s stock, which closed at a high of $147.51 on Tuesday, fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading once its results had been released. Apple raised the amount of money it was willing to commit to stock buybacks by $50 billion, and Mr. Maestri said that it would continue to buy despite the record price. \u201cWe really believe there is a lot of value in our stock,\u201d he said. Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., also raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent to 63 cents a share. Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said investors, too, are awaiting new iPhones. \u201cWhat\u2019s baked in the share price is a massive upgrade cycle,\u201d he said."}
