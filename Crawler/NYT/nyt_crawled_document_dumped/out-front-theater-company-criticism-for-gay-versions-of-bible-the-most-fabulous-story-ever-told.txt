That\u2019s what the Out Front Theater Company in Atlanta, which stages shows created only by people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning, will set out to answer for audiences during a three-week run of \u201cThe Most Fabulous Story Ever Told,\u201d starting April 27. However, its decision to do so has provoked a torrent of criticism over the play, which has been called \u201cblasphemous.\u201d The work is an alternate version and comedic sendup of stories from the Old Testament, presented through the eyes of a gay couple named Adam and Steve and a lesbian couple named Jane and Mabel. It was written by Paul Rudnick and premiered Off Broadway in 1998. The New York Times called it, a \u201cseriously silly theology treatise of a play.\u201d The Out Front Theater decided it would do its own rendition of it about a year ago. However, on March 27, emails, phone calls, letters and Facebook messages blasting the decision started pouring in. \u201cWe had already been in rehearsals for several weeks and had auditions before that,\u201d Paul Conroy, the theater\u2019s artistic director, said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s just when someone found us and my best guess was that it was a Monday, which means that people were at church on Sunday the day before, and that\u2019s when it picked up steam.\u201d The main driver of the protest seems to be a conservative Catholic group called America Needs Fatima, which circulated an online petition that has garnered more than 40,000 signatures. It says: \u201cI vehemently protest your showing the blasphemous play \u2018The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told,\u2019 which, among other blasphemies, refers to the Virgin Mary as a lesbian. Please cancel your showing of it.\u201d It also refers to the play as showing a \u201chomosexual version of the Old Testament.\u201d Mr. Conroy said there were no plans to cancel the show. \u201cI\u2019m going to let the show speak for itself,\u201d Mr. Conroy said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the benefit in responding because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to change their minds no matter what I say or anyone else says. These people have their minds made up even before it starts.\u201d"}
