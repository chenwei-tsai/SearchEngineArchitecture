Conspicuously not doing a victory lap was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios. A tentative agreement for a new three-year, master contract with the producers\u2019 alliance and unions representing more than 12,000 television and movie writers was reached at around 1 a.m. on the West Coast. The previous contract expired at midnight, and the Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, had vowed to go on strike as early as Tuesday morning. A walkout would have immediately sent late-night comedy shows into reruns and threatened important presentations planned by ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC to attract advertising. The unions declared in an email to members that they had won \u201cunprecedented gains.\u201d Leaders added: \u201cDid we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild\u2019s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept.\u201d One thing writers wanted and did not get was uniform pay for writing done across platforms, whether that be a traditional broadcast network, cable channel or streaming service. Still, the celebratory whoops of union members were warranted, said Miranda J. Banks, a professor of film and media at Emerson College in Boston, who followed the talks closely. Ms. Banks is the author of the 2014 book, \u201cThe Writers: A History of American Screenwriters and Their Guild.\u201d \u201cThe union was extremely tactical in these negotiations, and it shows in the outcome,\u201d she said. \u201cThey came in with a plan and expertly executed it.\u201d The guilds, with David Young serving as their chief negotiator, did seem to approach the talks in a strategic fashion. Bargaining started on March 13, with writers asking for a long list of contract enhancements. After breaking off on March 24 \u2014 each side blamed the other \u2014 Mr. Young and his cohorts immediately ratcheted up the pressure, sending letters to TV advertisers promising a strike if no deal was reached by Monday and asking members to authorize a walkout. Writers voted overwhelmingly to give their unions that cudgel; 6,310 ballots were cast, representing 68 percent of eligible voters, with 96 percent in favor of a walkout if no palatable deal was offered by studios. On Sunday, studios made a new offer \u2014 one reflecting improvements in some areas (health care) and scant movement in others (raises for streaming series) \u2014 and the unions on Monday afternoon made counteroffers that held a hard line on multiple demands, according to three people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings. \u201cCalm, cool, honest and authentic every step of the way,\u201d Damon Lindelof, a member of the union\u2019s negotiating committee, wrote in an email on Tuesday of the guild\u2019s leadership. Mr. Lindelof, whose credits include \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d \u201cWorld War Z,\u201d and \u201cLost,\u201d also gave credit to studio negotiators for \u201cbeing true to their word in hearing our membership\u2019s concerns about the dramatic shifts in the way our business now functions.\u201d Carol Lombardini, who led talks for the producers\u2019 alliance, declined an interview request. One big sticking point involved what is known as \u201cspan,\u201d or how long television writers spend on each script. There are more shows than ever, but networks are ordering far fewer episodes per season \u2014 as few as six, compared with 22 or more in the past. At the same time, the episodes that are ordered are taking longer to produce \u2014 up to three weeks per episode, rather than the usual two. So series writers who are paid per episode often make less while working more. Part of the deal involved a union health insurance plan, which is running steep deficits, in part because it provides extremely generous coverage. Studios agreed to a bailout, while the union agreed to cost-saving changes. To some degree, studios were concerned about setting a precedent for negotiations with other Hollywood unions. The actors\u2019 contract with producers expires on June 30. Share prices for most major entertainment companies were either unaffected or slightly down in trading on Tuesday. Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a research note that the deal with writers was \u201cpositive\u201d for media conglomerates, \u201cas a strike invited several serious risk factors,\u201d including \u201cpermanent acceleration of audience loss away from traditional TV and ad dollars from TV to digital.\u201d As the entertainment capital waited for word on down-to-the-wire talks on Monday, union loyalists posted messages on Twitter using the hashtag #wgaunity. Eileen Conn, whose credits include the Disney Channel series \u201cK.C. Undercover\u201d and the 1990s sitcom \u201cJust Shoot Me,\u201d posted a photo of Sally Field as the title character from the film \u201cNorma Rae\u201d and wrote: \u201cWe are strong! We are united!\u201d Some prominent politicians joined them. \u201cI stand with the Writers Guild of America for fair pay and decent health care because it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2014 and because Bruce and I can\u2019t wait for the next season of \u2018Ballers\u2019 to start,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Facebook, referring to her husband, Bruce Mann. In the last big Hollywood strike, a decade ago, an enraged Writers Guild walked out for 100 days over pay for digitally distributed shows. Tens of thousands of entertainment workers were idled, and the action cost the Los Angeles economy more than $2 billion, according to the Milken Institute."}
