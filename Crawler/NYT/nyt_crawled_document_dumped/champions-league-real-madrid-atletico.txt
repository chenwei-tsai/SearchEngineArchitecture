Ronaldo scored on a header in the 10th minute, on a strike into the top corner in the 73rd, and on a close-range shot in the 86th to give Real Madrid, the defending champions, a comfortable lead headed into next week\u2019s second leg at Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Vicente Calder\u00f3n Stadium. Monaco hosts Juventus in the first leg of the other semifinal on Wednesday. Real Madrid, which is looking to reach its third final in four seasons, was in control from the start at Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. Ronaldo had scored five goals in the two legs of the quarterfinals against Bayern Munich, including a hat trick in the second leg at Bernab\u00e9u. He opened the scoring on Tuesday after Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s defense failed to fully clear a cross. Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro sent the ball back in with a bouncing shot, and Ronaldo got ahead of defender Stefan Savic to knock it past Atl\u00e9tico goalkeeper Jan Oblak. Real Madrid added to its lead after Atl\u00e9tico defender Filipe Lu\u00eds lost the ball to Ronaldo, who entered the penalty area and fired a shot past Oblak into the upper corner of the net. Ronaldo scored his 10th Champions League goal of the season with a low shot from inside the penalty area after a pass from Lucas V\u00e1zquez. Ronaldo now has 103 goals in the Champions League, not counting one he scored in the qualifiers, which is three more than Atl\u00e9tico has scored since 1992, when the competition\u2019s new format was introduced. Real Madrid controlled possessions and caused problems for Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s defense with set pieces taken by midfielder Toni Kroos. Real Madrid had 11 attempts against one for Atl\u00e9tico in the first half. Atl\u00e9tico improved in the second half, keeping Real Madrid from threatening as much, but it still was not able to create many scoring opportunities. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and do something practically impossible next week,\u201d Atl\u00e9tico Coach Diego Simeone said. \u201cWe\u2019re Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and maybe, just maybe, we can do it.\u201d Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s best chance of the match came in the 17th minute, when forward K\u00e9vin Gameiro received the ball inside the penalty area but was not able to get it past Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas in a one-on-one situation. The crosstown rivals are meeting for the fourth consecutive time in the Champions League, the top European club competition. Real Madrid defeated Atl\u00e9tico in the final last season and in 2014, and also in the quarterfinals in 2015. Real Madrid, which won its record 11th title last year, is trying to become the first team to win back-to-back Champions League titles since the competition\u2019s new format began. No team has even reached the final as the defending champion since Manchester United did in 2009. Atl\u00e9tico, the third major power in Spanish soccer behind Real Madrid and Barcelona, is trying to win its first title and avenge the heartbreaking losses to Real Madrid in a penalty shootout last year and after extra time in 2014. Atl\u00e9tico also lost the final in 1974, to Bayern Munich. Tuesday\u2019s loss at Bernab\u00e9u was the first for Atl\u00e9tico in 16 away games."}
