Now, with his wife, Tali, he is opening a full-service restaurant. \u201cWe had requests from customers who wanted to be able to dine, to sit down,\u201d he said. The result is 72 seats in the garment district, with spots at a counter facing the team of chefs, and a bar that will serve beer, wine and sake by the glass, the bottle and in cocktails this summer. Dove-gray recycled wood is a prominent feature, as are the high ceilings. The sushi is largely made of grains, vegetables and fruit. There are also rice-paper wraps, salads, noodle bowls, dumplings and a new line of soups. And the offerings have broader appeal: Mr. Vaknin said a recent informal survey of his customers indicated that about 60 percent of them were not vegetarian or vegan. Takeout and catering are available. (Opens Friday): Beyond Sushi, 134 West 37th Street, 212-564-0869, beyondsushinyc.com. ALTESI DOWNTOWN At this new branch of his Upper East Side restaurant, Paolo Alavian takes a more informal approach. The chef Paolo Nozzoli\u2019s menu features wood-fired pizzas in addition to antipasti, pasta and main dishes. The thin-crust pizzas, made from a special blend of high-fiber flour, are shaped like ovals, the better to stay crisp, Mr. Alavian says. The space, formerly his restaurant Savore, has generous outdoor seating. (Wednesday): 200 Spring Street (Sullivan Street), 212-431-1212, altesinyc.com. CHIMICHURRI GRILL EAST The Upper East Side branch of this longstanding Argentine restaurant in the theater district has opened in a gracious townhouse, larger than the original, with a lounge area and a sleek marble bar. The menu of bright, lusty fare copies what\u2019s served on Ninth Avenue: 133 East 61st Street, 646-707-0801, chimichurrigrill.com. SURF SHACK AT GOOD STORY This tribute to summer at the shore is the latest theme for Good Story, the indoor-outdoor rooftop on the hotel where Harold Moore runs his restaurant Harold\u2019s Meat & Three. The menu looks to Baja California with tacos, a burger and fish sizzled on the outdoor grill: Good Story Rooftop, Arlo SoHo Hotel, 231 Hudson Street (Canal Street), arlohotels.com. HOLE IN THE WALL The Australian founders of this Midtown spot have opened a larger location tucked into a courtyard in the financial district. Brunch is served every day until 4 p.m., followed by small plates of cheese and charcuterie along with coffee drinks and cocktails: 15 Cliff Street (Fulton Street), 212-602-9991, holeinthewallnyc.com. HUDSON\u2019S The three-story yacht that housed Fish Bar last year has been rechristened and will ply the river for dinner cruises flying the New York Cruise Lines flag. On weekends, there will be daytime cruises. It will sail through September: Pier 81 (41st Street), 212-630-8840, hudsonsnyc.com.

(Friday): 1402 Second Avenue (73rd Street). \u201cTHE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROOM IN NEW YORK\u201d This new musical by the New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik, with music by David Shire, grew out of the friendship between Mr. Gopnik and David and Karen Waltuck, who owned Chanterelle, a restaurant that Mr. Gopnik knew well. He has written the story of a passionate chef with a small restaurant near Union Square who struggles in the cutthroat New York restaurant scene. A celebrity chef might save the day, or might not:  Wednesday through May 28, Long Wharf Theater, 222 Sargent Drive (Exit 46 off I-95), New Haven, 203-787-4282, longwharf.org. POKE CHAN Masashi Ito, the Los Angeles sushi chef who earned a Michelin star after settling in Greenwich Village with Sushi Zo last year, is opening a pair of poke restaurants.

But he said that he was not ready to retire, and would consider other options. L\u2019APICIO The Epicurean Group\u2019s spacious restaurant in the East Village will close after dinner on May 20. P\u00d3, where Mario Batali first came on the scene, has closed after 24 years. In 2000, Mr. Batali sold his interest in the restaurant to his partner Steven Crane, who could not sustain a big rent increase. JOE AND JILL DOBIAS, the owners of Joe and Misses Doe in the East Village, have closed their restaurant. \u201cWe were ready to move on,\u201d Ms. Dobias said. A few weeks ago, after meeting Jean-Georges Vongerichten and his partner, Phil Suarez, Mr. and Ms. Dobias suspended a project they were developing. Now, Mr. Dobias is the executive chef of Le Dock in Fair Harbor, on Fire Island, and his wife is the manager. Mr. Suarez opened Le Dock in 1976. The restaurant will open on a preliminary basis this weekend and serve lunch and dinner seven days a week starting in mid-June."}
