Gorka's new role will deal with the \"war of ideas\" involved in countering radical Islamic extremism and will entail an appointment to a federal agency, , a senior administration official said. Gorka has served for months on the Strategic Initiatives Group, an internal organization within the White House, and as a national security adviser. His exit from the White House comes amid increased speculation that a reported lack of a security clearance prevented him from fully performing in his job. But a source told the Washington Examiner that Gorka's role in SIG was always meant to be temporary and suggested he had been placed there while administration officials created a terrorism-related position for him elsewhere in the government. An official said Gorka has been in a \"holding pattern\" while he waited for the position, which will not be at the State Department, to be established. A spokesman for the National Security Council said he did not \"personally know\" the details about Gorka's move.
