In an interview with Reuters, arranged to highlight what he sees as his accomplishment of 100 days in office, Trump said, \u201cThis is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.\u201d  And surely he is right about the challenges of office. Just as he is reaching his first milestone moment, the president got news that the economy is slowing and that last-dash hopes of pushing through his health insurance plan had vanished.   Meantime, he and his foreign policy team are scrambling for a way to prevent a war on the Korean peninsula, and effort complicated by U.S.-China relations on a host of other issues. The natural response among the president\u2019s critics to Trump\u2019s admission that he misapprehended the nature of the office is to mock him as a fool. They do so at their own political peril.  When Trump was figuring out how to run for president, he did a lot of things wrong. But he was quick to learn and quick to adapt and in so doing managed to keep his improbable bid not just alive but thriving. \u00a0  You may or may not approve of the tactics he used to win the nomination and the presidency, but you cannot say that he did not figure out the game.   The president\u2019s defenders are busy trying to find a way to depict his first 100 days as a success. That is a mostly wasted effort since the entire purpose of the 100-day concept is about getting Congress to advance a legislative agenda. There is no way to say he did that. But what he can say is that he understands the presidency and the issues he faces in a way he did not before. Observe the exchange in the interview Trump granted the WaPo in which he explains how he reversed himself on NAFTA.   \u201cI was all set to terminate,\u201d Trump told the paper. \u201cI looked forward to terminating. I was going to do it.\u201d Trump was going to do his enthusiastic terminating at a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pa. on Saturday night. It would be hard to imagine anything more 2016-vintage Trump than blowing up a key trade treaty at a rally packed with thousands of red-hatted Rust Belt supporters. But he didn\u2019t do it. His reason was that his new agriculture secretary, Sonny Purdue, explained to him how damaging such a move would be to farmers. Trump dropped the idea then and there.  Now, you might call this government by caprice or believe that Trump is swayed by whomever he spoke to last.  But if we pull back and look at his decisions so far, there\u2019s a pretty clear direction here: normality.   During the presidential transition, some Democrats said that it was important not to \u201cnormalize\u201d Trump. The concern was that if news organizations, lawmakers and even the outgoing president treated Trump as legitimate then his bad behavior would be legitimized too.   But maybe instead of Trump being normalized, he is becoming more normal.   You can call it moving left if you want, but it would probably be more accurate to say that Trump\u2019s moves and reversals reflect not an ideological direction but simply a broader base of understanding.   There are no doubt many things that the federal government does, and keeps doing, for no good reason. But when it comes to long standing pieces for the U.S. foreign policy portfolio, things are generally the way they are for a reason.   If trade war with China is a good thing, somebody would have probably tried it a long time ago. If Russia was a reliable partner, one of the previous presidents probably would have found a way to make that happen. If NATO was obsolete, someone would have backed away from it. If NAFTA really was killing American jobs, Trump\u2019s Democratic and Republican predecessors might have had something to say about it.   Being president is hard and the demands it places on every man to hold the title are enormous. America does not have the problems it does for a lack of trying on the previous occupants of the Oval Office.   Trump once mocked his predecessors as \u201cdumb.\u201d One doubts he would make the same claim after only a little more than three months riding this particular tiger.\u00a0   Rather than laughing at Trump\u2019s surprise at the challenges of office, Democrats should instead be nervous that he might, after a fashion, learning how to do the job. [Watch Fox: On the eve of his 100th day, Donald Trump sits down for an exclusive interview on \u201cThe First 100 Days with Martha MacCallum.\u201d Tune in at 7 p.m. ET] THE RULEBOOK: $20 TRILLION, IN FACT  \u201cBut two considerations will serve to quiet all apprehension on this head: one is, that we are sure the resources of the community, in their full extent, will be brought into activity for the benefit of the Union; the other is, that whatever deficiences there may be, can without difficulty be supplied by loans.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 30  TIME OUT: JK, LOL Author Megan Garber reconsiders Neil Postman, the professor and critic behind the 1985 book \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death,\u201d in light of the new dominance of irony he predicted. The Atlantic: \u201cPostman today is best remembered as a critic of television: That\u2019s the medium he directly blamed, in Amusing Ourselves to Death, for what he termed Americans\u2019 \u2018vast descent into triviality,\u2019 and the technology he saw as both the cause and the outcome of a culture that privileged entertainment above all else. But Postman was a critic of more than TV alone. He mistrusted entertainment, not as a situation but as a political tool; he worried that Americans\u2019 great capacity for distraction had compromised their ability to think, and to want, for themselves. He resented the tyranny of the lol. His great observation, and his great warning, was a newly relevant kind of bummer: There are dangers that can come with having too much fun.\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions. SCOREBOARD Trump net job-approval rating:\u00a0-9 points Change from one week ago:\u00a0+4.2 points  CONGRESS EXTENDS SHUTDOWN DEADLINE FOR ONE WEEK USA Today: \u201cWith just hours left until a government shutdown at midnight, Congress passed a stopgap funding bill Friday that will keep the government open for another week. House members voted 382-30 to approve the legislation, which gives lawmakers until midnight on May 5 to try to reach a compromise on legislation to fund the government through the rest of fiscal year 2017, which ends Sept. 30. The Senate approved the weeklong funding bill by voice vote Friday, and President Trump has said he will sign it into law. \u2018The fact that we are here again at the last minute just trying to keep the government open is sad,\u2019 said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. \u2018Once again, we have a manufactured crisis at the edge of a cliff.\u2019 \u2026 The shutdown would have taken effect Saturday \u2014 Trump's 100th day in office \u2014 unless Congress acted.\u201d But TrumpCare vote nixed - WaPo: \u201cDespite pressure from the White House, House GOP leaders determined Thursday night that they didn\u2019t have the votes to pass a rewrite of the Affordable Care Act and would not seek to put their proposal on the floor on Friday. \u2026 The failure of Republicans to unite behind the new health-care measure was a blow to White House officials, who were eager to see a vote ahead of President Trump\u2019s 100-day mark. Congressional leaders were more focused this week on securing a spending agreement, according to multiple people involved in the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to talk publicly.\u201d Why are there still not enough votes for health care reform? - WashEx\u2019s Byron York explains the truth that many Republicans simply don\u2019t want to: \u201cAbout a week after the first Obamacare repeal failure, a House Republican, speaking privately, said the difficulty in passing the bill was not a parliamentary problem involving the complexities of the Senate and reconciliation. No, the lawmaker said, \u2018It is a problem that we have members in the Republican conference that do not want Obamacare repealed, because of their district. That's the fundamental thing that we're seeing here.\u2019\u201d TRUMP TO ATLANTA FOR NRA CONVENTION AND HOUSE RACE FUNDRAISER  AJC: \u201cPresident Donald Trump returns\u00a0to Georgia on Friday for the first time since his election with a whirlwind\u00a0visit that includes a speech\u00a0to the National Rifle Association\u2019s convention in downtown Atlanta\u00a0and a fundraiser\u00a0for Republican Karen Handel\u2019s campaign for Congress. Scores of protesters are ready to welcome the\u00a0president with demonstrations across town\u00a0targeting the Republican\u2019s embrace of the gun rights group and eager to remind him of the disparaging remarks he made in January about Atlanta. Trump\u2019s arrival comes at a fraught time. A day shy of the 100-day mark in his presidency, Trump faces sagging approval ratings. His keynote address to the NRA \u2014 he will be the first sitting president to address the group since Ronald Reagan \u2014 also comes as Georgia wrestles with a\u00a0controversial proposal to expand gun rights.\u201d  TRUMP WARNS OF MAJOR MILITARY ACTION AGAINST NOKO  Reuters: \u201cU.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday a major conflict with North Korea is possible in the standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, but he would prefer a diplomatic outcome to the dispute. \u2018There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely,\u2019 Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview ahead of his 100th day in office on Saturday. Nonetheless, Trump said he wanted to peacefully resolve a crisis that has bedeviled multiple U.S. presidents, a path that he and his administration are emphasizing by preparing a variety of new economic sanctions while not taking the military option off the table. \u2018We'd love to solve things diplomatically but it's very difficult,\u2019 he said. Tillerson tells UN NoKo \u2018the most pressing security issue in the world\u2019 - The Hill: \u201cSecretary of State\u00a0Rex Tillerson\u00a0on Friday called on the United Nations to tighten pressure on North Korea to dismantle its weapons programs, warning that a failure to do so could have \u2018catastrophic consequences.\u2019 \u2018For too long the international community has been reactive in addressing North Korea,\u2019 Tillerson said at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. \u2018Those days must come to an end. Failing to act now on the most pressing security issue in the world may bring catastrophic consequences.\u2019\u201d Fox News poll: Voters support military action against NoKo nukes - Fox News: \u201cIt will take military force to stop North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, a majority of voters believe\u2026 Fifty-one percent say that U.S. military action will be required to keep the rogue nation from continuing its nuclear weapons program, while 36 percent think diplomacy alone can stop it. By a 53-39 percent margin, voters favor the U.S. using military force to keep North Korea from making further advancements on nukes.\u201d   POWER PLAY: WHAT\u2019S FRENCH FOR GIANT RABBIT?

AUDIBLE: ORDER A STRIKE\u2026 ON YOUR THIRST  \u201cEveryone does get a little nervous when I press that button.\u201d \u2013\u00a0President Trump said in\u00a0an interview\u00a0with the Financial Times when the reporter jokingly asked whether the red button on his desk was the \u201cnuclear button.\u201d The president used the button, actually an intercom, to order soft drinks for himself and his guest. FROM THE BLEACHERS \u201cI think every voter should be able to pass the citizenship test to qualifying to vote.\u00a0 I know that my dad, who was born in 1885 and only went to school for 4 years knew more about our government than most voters today.\u00a0 I graduated from high school and we had civics and government classes and I try to stay informed.\u00a0\u2026 I agree, the biggest problem today is ignorance and they don't want to discuss issues.\u00a0 They just want to protest.\u00a0 I guess they get paid to do that.\u201d \u2013 Barbara Hucker, LaCrosse, Ind. [Ed. note: It is delicious to think of how our country would be different if our citizens had to meet the same requirements for civics knowledge that immigrants do. But as you know, I\u2019m sure, disenfranchising voters for being ignorant of their country and its system is probably a non-starter. But it does raise the issue of voting as an inherently good thing. Public officials and celebrities are always urging people to get out to vote. Low voter turnout is decried as a reflection of apathy. But, we are not helped by people who are unaware of the issues or candidates blindly going to vote based on specious criteria. If you don\u2019t know anything about the people running for Congress in your district or whether or not the school bond is good or not, maybe you should stay home. There is nothing wrong with sitting out an election if you do not care enough to do at least a cursory job of preparing to make a good choice.]   \u201cWhile reading your comments about \u2018ignorance\u2019 I was drawn to reply: You can\u2019t fix stupid; but can you define it? (Most people can define it but only, insofar, as it perpetuates their own beliefs.) Said another way:\u00a0 Beauty fades but stupid stays. Seems appropriate to say about politics, eh?\u201d \u2013 Carla Ball, Kahoka, Mo. [Ed. note: More than appropriate, Ms. Ball! There is debate on whether or not Americans are getting more stupid, but there is no argument on the blossoming flower of ignorance in our midst. Part of the problem is the degree to which people are proud of not knowing. The death of expertise as a sought-after characteristic has been remarkable to watch.]  \u201cI love the Federalist quotes.\u00a0 They are thought provoking.\u00a0 Too bad we don\u2019t stop and think!\u00a0 Voltaire, a generation or two before Hamilton, Jay, and Madison across the pond, was attacking the French establishment and church said; \u2018It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong.\u2019\u00a0 I wonder what he would say today now that the pendulum has swung in the other direction and the church is under attack by the new \u2018established authorities\u2019. \u2026 They are infecting the nation with anarchy and are too arrogant to recognize the harm they are doing to our Republic by ignoring our foundation.\u00a0 Truth is not malleable when it doesn\u2019t fit our wishes.\u201d \u2013 Craig L. Cox, Dallas  [Ed. note: I take a slightly different view, Mr. Cox. I think that for American Christians, the less hospitable atmosphere may end up being a good thing. If we think of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and his treatise, \u201cThe Cost of Discipleship,\u201d we are reminded that it is only when discipleship comes at a price that adherents are aware of its value. The bland civic religion of the United States for most of our history was an inclusive mix of Judeo-Christian values. And it was helpful from a social and economic perspective to be a part of that club. The time may come when that is no longer the case, if it even still is. If the price of discipleship is going up, then perhaps, so is its value.]  Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0 HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.  CUE THE END ZONE DANCE  Fox Sports: \u201cT.J. Onwuanibe wanted to announce the Baltimore Ravens\u2019 first-round pick at the NFL Draft, and the 14-year-old who has been battling a rare brain cancer got his chance Thursday. The eighth-grader got an intro from Commissioner Roger Goodell, a nice ovation from the Philadelphia crowd, and then totally fell into his role, dropping a righteous fist pump as he announced that his favorite team had selected Alabama cornerback Marlon Humphrey with the 16th overall pick. Onwuanibe, a Maryland native who roots for the Ravens, was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer in 2015 but is now in remission. The Make-A-Wish Foundation heard his desire to attend the draft and worked with the Ravens to arrange to send him. Baltimore coach John Harbaugh delivered that news to him just last week.\u201d  AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201cAs a result of pressure by the United States, in two occasions, over the last ten days, when you might have expected a new nuclear test. We were all expecting it, it didn't happen, that was a dog that didn't bark.\u201d \u2013 Charles\u00a0Krauthammer\u00a0on \u201cSpecial Report with\u00a0Bret\u00a0Baier.\u201d Chris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Brianna McClelland\u00a0contributed to this report.
