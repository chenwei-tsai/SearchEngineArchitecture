McMaster attempted to make clear Sunday that President Trump is seeking international support in trying to stop North Korea\u2019s pursuit of a nuclearize weapon, reasserting Trump\u2019s vow that the U.S. will no longer be the world\u2019s policeman. \u201cIt\u2019s an open defiance of the international community,\u201d McMaster, a retired Army general, told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important for all of us to confront this regime\u2026 . None of us can accept a North Korea with a nuclear weapon.\u201d From essentially the start of Trump\u2019s winning presidential campaign, he has criticized previous administrations about the financial and geo-political consequences of leading efforts to police or overthrow foreign regimes. He even threatened to resign from NATO unless other countries started paying their fair share for such efforts. \u201cWe cannot be the policeman of the world,\u201d Trump said in a September 2016 presidential debate. \u201cWe cannot protect countries all over the world, where they're not paying us what we need.\" MCMASTER SAYS US WILL PAY FOR THAAD ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM IN SOUTH KOREA Trump has since taking office attempted to form alliances with world leaders to solve such global crises as the Syrian civil war and the North Korea nuclear threat, including an outreach to China President XI Jinping. \u201cThe president, I think, has been masterful in terms his development of a relationship with President Xi and in the discussions that led them to the place where the United States and the Chinese understand their interests overlap.\u201d Trump, who last week warned about the potential for a \u201cmajor conflict\u201d with North Korea, has also tried to strength relations with U.S. ally Japan. In February, he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with the two playing golf at Trump\u2019s course in Jupiter, Fla. McMaster on Sunday set out several options toward ending North Korea\u2019s efforts -- a combination of nuclear tests and trying to develop a rocket that could carry a nuclear weapon. He said world leaders could enforce existing economic sanctions, impose additional ones or possibly taking military action. McMaster also said China, essential to North Korea\u2019s economy, has shown a \u201cwillingness to act and resolve this conflict short of military conflict.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/30/mcmaster-says-us-must-be-prepared-for-military-operations-in-north-korea.html"}
