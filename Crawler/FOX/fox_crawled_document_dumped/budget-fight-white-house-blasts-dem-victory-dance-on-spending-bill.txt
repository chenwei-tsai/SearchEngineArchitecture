{"title": "Budget fight: White House blasts Dem victory dance on spending bill | Fox News", "time": "2017-05-02T21:15:00.000-04:00", "text": "The Trump administration launched a full-court press Tuesday to defend the controversial $1 trillion-plus budget deal, after Democrats claimed victory in negotiations and conservatives claimed GOP leaders gave too much ground. Critics complained that the deal announced Monday to avert a government shutdown would keep funding for Planned Parenthood and so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d without funding President Trump\u2019s promised border wall. As Trump himself defended the package, the administration dispatched top officials to make their case. In a lively presentation during the White House briefing Tuesday afternoon -- and armed with visual aids -- White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said this was no victory for Democrats. He said Second Amendment and pro-life protections were still in the bill, while other Democratic pet projects were not.\u00a0He accused Democrats of \u201cspiking the football\u201d and said \u00a0the president cut \u201ca tremendous deal for the American people.\u201d \u201c[Democrats] wanted a shutdown \u2026 they were desperate to make this administration look like we couldn\u2019t function, like we couldn\u2019t govern,\u201d he said. He pointed in particular to the abolition of the Obama-era \u201cparity rule\u201d \u2013 whereby increases in defense spending had to be matched dollar-for-dollar with a rise in domestic spending. He said there is no ObamaCare bailout money, no money for Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid, and no renewable energy subsidies. Mulvaney also came armed with pictures of a 20-foot-high steel wall, saying there are \u201cseveral hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d to install such a barrier on the border. He didn\u2019t offer specifics but said, \u201cWe are building this.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we got in this deal and that\u2019s what the Democrats don\u2019t want you to know,\u201d he told reporters. Congress has until Friday at midnight to pass the new budget package. Ahead of the expected votes, Democrats hailed what they cast as a victory over the Trump administration, pointing to a $5 billion increase in domestic spending, including a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health. Although Republicans managed to secure a $1.5 billion portion for border enforcement and a $21 billion hike in defense spending, both were less than what Trump had hoped for, and Democrats noted the border money wouldn\u2019t allow for a deportation force or Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise of a wall. Conservative groups such as Heritage Action, as well as conservative personalities,\u00a0came out hard against the deal, saying Republicans had caved to Democratic priorities. Mulvaney\u2019s vigorous defense of the deal was the latest step in a pushback that started early Tuesday when Trump himself tweeted that the plan was negotiated as such because \u201cwe need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there!\u201d He added a warning shot: \"Our country needs a good 'shutdown' in September to fix mess!\" Later at a White House ceremony to award a trophy to the Air Force football team, Trump again hailed parts of the deal, saying it secured the \"single largest increase in border security funding in 10 years\" and noted the increase in defense spending. \"You're going to have the money we need and the equipment we need,\" he said. \"Our military is going to be taken care of, that I promise you.\" Defense Secretary James Mattis said in a statement that he was \"pleased\" at the $21 billion defense spending increase, calling it \"an important step toward rebuilding military readiness at a time when we are confronting serious security challenges throughout the globe.\" \"Everything from new missiles and ammunition, to facility upgrades, to new aircraft are being funded by this bill,\" Mattis added. \"This budget agreement reaffirms the president's commitment to responsibly fund defense.\" Vice President Pence appeared on Rush Limbaugh\u2019s radio show to defend the deal, a day after the conservative talk show host blasted the deal as a \u201csellout, disaster, betrayal.\u201d Limbaugh didn\u2019t hold back, asking Pence: \"If this is what happens, Mr. Vice President, why vote Republican?\" \u201cIn this new president you had someone who was able to bring people together and make a $21 billion increase in defense spending at a time of great challenge,\u201d Pence responded. When Limbaugh said refugee resettlement, EPA and Planned Parenthood are all funded while the wall is not, Pence disagreed and said that the border spending was only the first step on a policy he says is already decreasing illegal migration. \u201cThis is a short- term bill\u2026.but I think it demonstrates that in President Trump\u2019s leadership the American people have \u00a0a president who can bring together both parties,\u201d he said. Limbaugh was unimpressed: \u201cWell, Mr. Vice President, we\u2019ve been told this for 15 years, \u2018we\u2019ll get \u2018em next time,\u2019 after every continuing resolution, \u2018we\u2019ll get \u2018em next time, we\u2019ll kick the can, we\u2019ll get em next time.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe got \u2018em this time,\u201d laughed Pence. At a House GOP leadership press conference Tuesday morning, Speaker Paul Ryan and other top Republicans also defended the package. Ryan touted the \u201cdown payment on border security\u201d and dismissed what he called Democrats\u2019 \u201cPR machine\u201d playing up their end of the bargain. \u201cDon\u2019t look at the press releases, look at the bill,\u201d Ryan said, adding there are \u201ca lot of conservative wins here.\u201d Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., touted pay raises for military service members and cuts to \u201careas where we\u2019ve seen government run out of control\u201d like the EPA. But despite the assurances from leadership, members of the House Freedom Caucus predicted conservative opposition in Congress. \"Money goes to Planned Parenthood, as you said. Money continues to go to sanctuary cities, but no money for the border wall,\" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in an interview with CNN. \"I think you're going to see a lot of conservatives against this plan this week.\" The bill is expected to go to the House floor Wednesday, and to the Senate Thursday, ahead of the shutdown deadline on Friday.
