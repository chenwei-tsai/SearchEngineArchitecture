Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said at the start of the hearing. \u201cSeize this opportunity, because if you don\u2019t we\u2019re going to act and you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d United CEO Oscar Munoz testified before the panel alongside four other airline representatives about customer service policies following a rash of incidents caught on camera that included one bloodied passenger being dragged off a United flight. Munoz, who was there with the airline\u2019s president, Scott Kirby, promised to work \u201cincredibly hard\u201d to regain the trust of customers following the April 9 incident at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport when passenger Dr. David Dao was dragged off the plane. Munoz called the episode \u201ca mistake of epic proportions\u201d and a \u201cturning point for United.\u201d \u201cIn that moment, for our customers and our company, we failed, and so as CEO, at the end of the day, that is on me,\u201d Munoz testified. He added, \u201cUltimately, our actions will speak louder than words.\u201d Since the incident, United has taken a series of steps to reduce overbooking and plans to raise the limit on payments to customers who voluntarily give up seats on oversold flights to $10,000. Munoz also promised to improve employee training. Also at the hearing were senior executives of Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Air Group as well as an aviation consultant for the Consumers Union. Unlike United, which has vowed to reduce -- but not eliminate -- overbooking, Southwest said it would eliminate it all together. Currently, JetBlue is one of the only U.S. carriers that has started to phase out overbooking flights. Lawmakers also called out airline executives on \u201ccontracts of carriage\u201d which customers must sign when purchasing a plane ticket. The contracts detail the airlines\u2019 boarding, baggage and customer service policies and under what conditions a passenger can be removed from a flight. Most of the contracts are several pages of single-spaced tiny font. For example, Alaska Air\u2019s contract is 67 pages and is more than 37,000 words long. United\u2019s contract is 46 pages and contains more than 37,000 words. \u201cWe need transparency and simple language in the contract of carriage,\u201d Rep. Peter DeFazio, the committee\u2019s highest-ranking Democrat, said. Alaska agreed to boil down theirs to a single page. Southwest pledged to work on simplifying theirs.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/02/united-ceo-apologizes-at-house-hearing-as-lawmakers-issue-warning.html", "source": "FOX"}
