That would be 94-95 percent of 46 percent. About 10 percent of the people who didn\u2019t vote for him approve of him ... and realistically we are right back where we were on Election Day.\" FOX NEWS POLL: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS GETTING MIXED REVIEWS According to a Fox News Poll published last week, 97 percent of Trump voters said they were satisfied with their choice, while just three percent of Hillary Clinton voters wished they had voted differently. Penn also said that the wording of most survey questions about Trump revealed a \"polling bubble.\" FOX NEWS POLL: 53 PERCENT FAVOR MILITARY ACTION TO STOP NORTH KOREA NUKE PROGRAM \"You look at the questions that pollsters ask, they\u2019re the kind of questions you make up in New York, Washington or Los Angeles,\" he said. \"None of them typically cover all of the Trump message points. They typically cover all the opposition message points ...\u00a0They don\u2019t see both sides, and America is split. There are two sides.\" Penn also noted that most polls don't \"screen for either citizenship or likelihood to vote\" and didn't ask questions about \"whether or not sanctuary cities are popular, corruption in Washington [or] support for the police.\" The veteran pollster told Carlson that one poll should make a point of field-testing all of Trump's political messages, noting that \"some will be successful.\" \"There is a lot of puzzlement [about] why authorities in cities wouldn\u2019t take people they arrest and then inform immigration authorities,\" Penn said. \"But on the other hand, a lot of people don\u2019t want to build a [border] wall. So, there are pluses and minuses in what Trump says, and we have to be realistic that both exist, quite strongly.\"", "source": "FOX", "title": "Ex-Clinton pollster: Surveys about Trump reveal 'polling bubble' | Fox News"}
