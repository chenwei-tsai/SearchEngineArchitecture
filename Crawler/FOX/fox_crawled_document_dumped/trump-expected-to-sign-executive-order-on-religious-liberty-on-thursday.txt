An early draft of the order, leaked in February, would have established broad exemptions for people and groups to claim religious objections under strong language. The new draft of the executive order is being tightly held, Politico reported. A person identified as an \"influential conservative\" by Politico who saw the text said it hasn't been dialed back much since the leak. \u201cThe language is very, very strong,\u201d the source told Politico. Progressive critics have argued the executive order would allow discrimination against the LGBT community at the federal level. Vice President Pence has been a proponent of the plan, and his office has been reportedly pushing for it for months. While governor of Indiana, Pence signed a similar state law on religious liberty that stirred up controversy across the country, but was seen as a legislative win and rallying cry for social conservatives. Fox News' Serafin Gomez and John Roberts contributed to this report.", "time": "2017-05-02T19:47:00.000-04:00", "source": "FOX", "title": "Trump expected to sign executive order on religious liberty on Thursday | Fox News"}
