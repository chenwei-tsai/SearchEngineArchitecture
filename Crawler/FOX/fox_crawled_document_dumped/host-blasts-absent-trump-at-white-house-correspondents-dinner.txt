And that's because he lives in Moscow. It's a very long flight. As for the other guy, I think he's in Pennsylvania because he can't take a joke.\" Trump\u2019s tweeting habits and his administration were not off limits in Minhaj\u2019s final speech of the night. \u201cJeff Sessions couldn\u2019t be here tonight\u201d Minhaj said. \u201cHe was busy doing a pre-Civil War re-enactment.\u201d Minhaj took a turn at lecturing journalists who were seated for the dinner and told them that \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t care about free speech.\u201d \"We're living in this strange time where trust is more important than truth,\u201d Minhaj said. He said later \u201cin the age of Trump, I know that you guys have to be more perfect now than ever. Because you are how he gets his news.\u201d Aside from Minhaj\u2019s jokes, speakers, including reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, promoted freedom and responsibility and challenged Trump\u2019s accusations of dishonest reporting. \"Like politicians and presidents sometimes, perhaps too frequently, we make mistakes and go too far,\" Woodward said. \"When that happens we should own up to it. But the effort today to get this best obtainable version of the truth is largely made in good faith. Mr. President, the media is not 'fake news.'\" Trump became the first president since Ronald Reagan in 1981 to skip the event. Instead, the president held a rally in Harrisburg, Pa. to celebrate his first 100 days in office. Trump told rally-goers that he was happy he was not in Washington. \"A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now,\" Trump said. He added: \"And I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from Washington's swamp, spending my evening with all of you and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people, right?\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/30/host-blasts-absent-trump-at-white-house-correspondents-dinner.html"}
