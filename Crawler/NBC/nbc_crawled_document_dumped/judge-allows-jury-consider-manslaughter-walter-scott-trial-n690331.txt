Slager is charged in the April 2015 shooting death of Walter Scott, who fled from a traffic stop and resisted arrest. The final moments of their encounter were captured on a bystander's cellphone video that shocked the nation. While the jury was visiting the scene of the shooting on Wednesday morning, Judge Clifton Newman told attorneys he would grant the prosecution's request to let jurors consider manslaughter as well as murder. South Carolina law defines murder as the unlawful taking of life with malice. In Slager's case \u2014 because the prosecution is alleging no aggravating circumstances that could bring a death sentence \u2014 murder carries a penalty of 30 years to life. The prosecution contends that by shooting Scott repeatedly in the back as the motorist tried to run away, Slager showed evidence of malice.

Defense attorney Andy Savage did not object in court to the addition of the lesser charge. After hearing from 55 witnesses, the jurors were taken to the crime scene Wednesday. The vacant lot in North Charleston was the last step before closing arguments Wednesday afternoon in the month-long trial. The jury \u2014 11 white people and one black man \u2014 have already seen a bystander's cellphone video of the shooting multiple times over the course of the trial. Circuit Judge Clifton Newman told the jurors not to take notes or discuss what they see at the scene. Court officials and one representative each from the defense and prosecution went along, but the media was not allowed to attend."}
