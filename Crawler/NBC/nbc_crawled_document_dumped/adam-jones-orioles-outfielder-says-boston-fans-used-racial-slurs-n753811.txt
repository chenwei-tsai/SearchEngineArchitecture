It was stupid and ignorant.\" He said his first reaction was: \"OK. This is really how it's going to go down here. ... Square up. Let's fight and get it over with.\" The Red Sox apologized Tuesday, saying, \"No player should have an object thrown at him on the playing field, nor be subjected to any kind of racism at Fenway Park.\" The entire organization, the team said, was \"sickened by the conduct of an ignorant few.\" Jones said Red Sox principal owner John Henry also visited him and Orioles manager Buck Showalter on Monday night to apologize in person. \"I liked and appreciated he came and talked to me face to face,\" Jones said. \"He expressed his disgust and apologized for the whole city.\" Jones said players accept fan abuse as part of the game \u2014 as long as it's \"normal.\" \"Berate us. Cuss us out. Tell us we suck,\" he said, but \"leave it to performance-based comments.\" \"It's Orioles-Red Sox.
