But when she drew the bow across the edge of her musical saw, out came an otherworldly sound: an ethereal, lilting sonority that seemed to pervade every corner and corridor of the cavernous Herald Square subway station in Manhattan where Ms. Paruz had set up on a recent weekday. Her saw is custom-built with no teeth. But even defanged, it cut through the din of the station \u2014 the wheezing and clattering of the trains, the whinny of the escalator, the blaring announcements \u2014 and reeled in commuters as they walked past her spot, near the escalator to the uptown B, D, F and M subway lines. They pulled out their earbuds and stopped to listen. Some recorded her with their phones. Some tossed money into her tip jar, a plastic bucket spray painted gold. She tucked the wider end of the saw between her knees, and with her left hand held the narrow, bendable end. Bowing with her right hand, she coaxed out a pitch that she controlled by bending and twisting the blade, at times jiggling it to create an expressive trembling vibrato. Ms. Paruz, who would not give her age, played with an exalted smile and seemed to finish every phrase with an flourishing upward sweep of the bow, ending in a brief pose like a crowd-pleasing rock guitarist. \u201cWell, it is heavy metal, when you think about it,\u201d she said jokingly, about the saw blade. A hot-pink banner hung overhead announcing her as Natalia (Saw Lady) Paruz, embedding the nickname she has officially trademarked. Ms. Paruz, who also plays in the Times Square and Union Square subway stations, knows hundreds of songs, from classical pieces to children\u2019s tunes, but favors romantic selections that are soothing to harried commuters. Having a concert pianist as a mother and a metallurgist as a father, she said, made finding her calling playing the saw the inevitable \u201cinterim between them.\u201d As a teenager training with the Martha Graham Company, Ms. Paruz said, her dream of becoming a dancer ended when a taxi hit her in Manhattan. While rehabilitating, she heard a saw being played in a revue performance, she recalled, and saw an alternative career beckoning her \u201cfrom providence.\u201d She borrowed a rusty saw from her landlady and began teaching herself, scouting out local hardware stores for better instruments. During breaks from her job selling souvenirs at a Broadway theater, she practiced in a parking lot. But one day she was handed a $5 tip, which helped persuade her to move to the sidewalk to play for theater crowds. The tips poured in and she quickly quit her theater job and started playing for crowds in Times Square. \u201cI\u2019m a lazy Libra,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I were practicing at home, I\u2019d be taking breaks. But playing for crowds kept me from stopping, so I owe the pedestrians of New York for my good technique.\u201d The cold weather moved her into the subway, where she has remained busking for the past 20 years. She has become arguably the best-known saw player in New York, and has found her way into numerous write-ups, movie soundtracks, radio programs, television segments and music festivals. She has played with top orchestras, even under the baton of the conductor Zubin Mehta, and has performed at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center and Madison Square Garden. \u201cThose halls have great acoustics,\u201d Ms. Paruz said. \u201cBut I tell you, the subway has better acoustics for the saw.\u201d The Remington rifle carrying case she uses to ferry her saw has, it should come as no surprise, provoked attention from the authorities. Some airport security officials have told her to step away from the case, while others have recognized her from the subway and waved her through. Some police officers have searched the bag, then chuckled. But on one occasion an officer in Times Square called the saw a weapon and cited her. \u201cI said, \u2018But the teeth are even facing toward me,\u2019\u201d she said, recalling the encounter. \u201cShe said, \u2018Nope, it\u2019s a weapon,\u2019 and gave me a $150 ticket.\u201d After that, Ms. Paruz ordered a custom-built saw with no teeth, her current instrument. She lives with her husband, Scott Munson, a composer who has written pieces for her. Ms. Paruz still has more than 20 old saws, now retired, and on her walls hang a dozen drawings and portraits of her done by artists she has befriended in the subways. She organizes conventions of saw players in New York City, and in 2009 assembled 53 saw players into one ensemble. On a recent weekday, she played a duet at her Herald Square spot with a recorder player, Yossi Wald. Mr. Wald, an 81-year-old Israeli composer, writes original melodies for Ms. Paruz whenever he visits New York. \u201cThe music is just a reason to meet people,\u201d said Ms. Paruz, whose goal is to keep promoting this novelty instrument, which can be turned into a source of sublime expression, and to keep playing in subway stations. \u201cWhat greater privilege than to fill the arteries of New York City with my sound,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if I get to be a millionaire, or win an Oscar, I\u2019d still play the subway. It\u2019s like a drug.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T07:00:03-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/nyregion/saw-lady-natalia-paruz-subway-nyc.html", "item_type": "Article"}
