Ask adults in your life how they manage their money, bills, and any money left over after bills are paid. What hard choices do they have to make about money on a regular basis? How do they choose what to do?

Why or why not? Which of them, if any, did you empathize with, understand, or take issue with? Did you learn anything from any of them? If so, what was it? \u2014 What choices do you make about money every day, and how do you make your decisions? What trade-offs do you make to pay for what you need and want, now and in the future? \u2014 Do you like the way you make money decisions, and do you think your choices are good ones?
