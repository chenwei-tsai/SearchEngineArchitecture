In fact, the election of President Donald Trump has coincided with a swell of like-minded candidates all over Europe: Politicians like Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, who was defeated in the country\u2019s general election this March, and Marine Le Pen, who hopes to advance to France\u2019s runoff presidential election after the first round of voting takes place on Sunday; as well as similar figures in the Alternative for Germany party and Italy\u2019s Northern League. But have the New York Times reporters tasked with covering those candidates found that they share Mr. Trump\u2019s adversarial approach when it comes to the news media? In the case of Ms. Le Pen, not exactly. Adam Nossiter, a Paris correspondent who has covered her throughout this election season, said that while she was \u201cpugnacious, and she has a kind of mocking affect, she\u2019s far from closed.\u201d Ms. Le Pen has sought to distance her party, the National Front, from the racism and anti-Semitism espoused by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who stepped down as its leader in 2011 and was expelled from the party by Ms. Le Pen in 2015. Part of that effort is an active engagement with the world media. (For the most part, at least.) \u201cShe answers every question, she\u2019s very thorough, she explains her thinking. I hesitate to say she\u2019s exactly generous, but she\u2019s not grudging,\u201d said Alissa Rubin, the Paris bureau chief for The Times. \u201cShe\u2019s a busy, capable politician.\u201d \u201cTheir whole strategy is normalization and communication,\u201d Mr. Nossiter said. \u201cThey probably don\u2019t always tell the truth, or maybe not even very much, but they want to talk.\u201d The election of President Trump may have cast a more agreeable aura around American journalists in the eyes of populist parties in Europe \u2014 even those who work for publications Mr. Trump finds objectionable. Mr. Nossiter believes they are tacitly associated with the Trump administration purely by virtue of nationality. \u201cThey like Trump,\u201d he said, and \u201cthat helps, in a weird way.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean reporters can walk right up to Ms. Le Pen whenever they like. \u201cThierry is always there,\u201d Mr. Nossiter said, referring to Ms. Le Pen\u2019s bodyguard, Thierry L\u00e9gier. \u201cIf you get too close to Marine, he\u2019ll push you away. I\u2019ve had that experience. You don\u2019t really want to get pushed around by Thierry. He\u2019s huge.\u201d But denying access is the exception, rather than the rule, with Ms. Le Pen. The campaign of Mr. Wilders, by contrast, was much more restrictive. Milan Schreuer, who covered the Dutch election for The Times, found the Wilders campaign very open late last year. After the race began in January, however, things changed. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get an interview, we couldn\u2019t even get the most simple, basic questions answered. It was impossible for us to get through,\u201d he said. Mr. Wilders held few campaign events, and traveled with a large security contingent \u2014 a result of threats he\u2019s received, but also a bit of showmanship, Mr. Schreuer said. At one event in a suburb of Rotterdam, Mr. Wilders was ensconced in a ring of police officers, handing out fliers. Mr. Schreuer was \u201cquite violently pushed back by the police for no reason,\u201d he said, while trying to ask a question. Mr. Wilders had to shout over the police to supporters, or usher them through the line. It was an apt metaphor for the campaign\u2019s broader media strategy. \u201cThey were cherry-picking certain news outlets for interviews they wanted to do,\u201d Mr. Schreuer said, and that was it. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have access.\u201d Though Mr. Wilders was defeated, recent polls show Ms. Le Pen neck and neck with the centrist candidate, Emmanuel Macron, as Ms. Rubin explores in a profile of Mr. Macron. If Ms. Le Pen emerges as one of the top two vote-getters and wins a run-off election next month, it\u2019s unknown whether her approach to the American press will change. But her particular brand of normalization through exposure has gotten her this far. In the French press, this method has been termed \u201cd\u00e9diabolisation.\u201d It translates, Mr. Nossiter explained, to \u201cun-deviling.\u201d", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
