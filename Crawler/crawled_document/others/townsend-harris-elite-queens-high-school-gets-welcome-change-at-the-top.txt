The cause of celebration on Thursday at Townsend Harris High School in Queens was not a victory on a sports field, but word that an interim acting principal who was widely disliked would be leaving. Some of those who were cheering knew little about the man who would succeed her, but that hardly seemed to matter. \u201cI figured at this point, anyone would be better,\u201d said Erela Datuowei, a senior. Since arriving at Townsend Harris in the fall, the interim principal, Rosemarie Jahoda, had been opposed by almost all factions. Teachers had accused her of harassment and rudeness. Students and parents had expressed concerns about changes to school programs. In December, students held a sit-in to protest her appointment, and the parent-teacher association passed a resolution that included a list of complaints about her. Elected officials in Queens had stated their opposition to her permanent appointment. The school newspaper, The Classic, had learned that an announcement about a permanent principal was expected on Thursday. As a large crowd gathered in the school\u2019s library, the superintendent who oversees the school, Elaine Lindsey, met privately in another room with members of the school leadership team. Ms. Lindsey told the group that Brian Condon, 43, the principal of the School for Tourism and Hospitality in the Bronx, would be named the permanent principal of Townsend Harris as of May 1. Soon after, leadership team members emerged to share the news, prompting the cheers. \u201cSo they won,\u201d said Susan Karlic, a co-president of the parent-teacher association, referring to students and teachers. \u201cTo new beginnings.\u201d She asked if anyone had questions. \u201cWill Ms. Jahoda stay in the building until May 1?\u201d a staff member asked, clearly hoping the answer would be no. Franco Scardino, a social studies teacher and the leader of the school\u2019s union chapter, said of the outcome of the selection process, \u201cFor me it just proves that the system works.\u201d Townsend Harris has more than 1,100 students and a graduation rate of 100 percent. Mr. Condon\u2019s current school, where he has been principal since 2013, has only 300 students, and a graduation rate of just 69 percent. Mr. Condon was previously an English teacher and a dean at Martin Van Buren High School in Queens. Asked about the differences between Mr. Condon\u2019s current school and Townsend Harris, Mr. Scardino said they did not concern him. \u201cTownsend Harris is a well-oiled machine,\u201d Mr. Scardino said. \u201cI think Mr. Condon is a person who can come in, see what works, identify things that maybe can be improved upon, but I think it\u2019s going to make his job a little easier.\u201d \u201cI think he will find a lot of support among people,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause I can confidently say that we all want him to succeed.\u201d Contacted for comment, Ms. Jahoda said via email, \u201cWhile there have been many inaccurate allegations, I have always focused on best serving students and families at Townsend.\u201d A half-hour after the announcement, staff members were still beaming and hugging one another. Some wondered whether Ms. Jahoda, who had left the building either before or during the announcement, would return to the school before May 1. The parent coordinator, Dafne Manhart, said that Ms. Jahoda had already turned in her keys. Ms. Manhart said she was happy about the news and hoped that Mr. Condon would restore some stability to the school. But later, after the crowd had cleared out of the library, she acknowledged that she also sympathized with Ms. Jahoda. \u201cI feel so sorry for her,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s a human, and it\u2019s sad. I\u2019m just hoping that everything will be better.\u201d", "abstract": "Parents, teachers and students at the school wanted anyone but the interim acting principal to get the job.
