Four years ago, Mr. de Blasio made an ambitious proposal to provide publicly funded prekindergarten to all 4-year-olds the centerpiece of his mayoral campaign. His plan called for more than tripling the number of available seats, to 70,000, within two years. Although some expected there would be significant bumps in the rollout, it went relatively smoothly. It is too soon to say whether the program will affect outcomes like test scores or high school graduation rates, but even sharp critics of the mayor\u2019s overall approach to education say that he deserves credit for making the program more widely available. On Monday, speaking at a public school in the Bronx, the mayor did not propose such a rapid expansion to 3-year-olds. He said the city planned to start in two districts, District 7 in the Bronx and District 23 in Brooklyn. \u201cWe have proven through the growth of pre-K that it can be done and it can be done quickly,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s time to reach children earlier.\u201d Mr. de Blasio said the expansion would start in September and that by September 2018, all 3-year-olds in those districts who want a seat in prekindergarten will have one. The city projects that it will serve 1,800 children in those two districts, triple the number of children enrolled today. By the fall of 2020, he said, the program, which the city is calling \u201c3-K for All,\u201d would expand to another six school districts, with universal access across the city available by 2021. The mayor said that the city was putting $36 million in the next budget to cover the expansion and that by the time all 3-year-olds are eligible, in 2021, the program would cost $177 million.", "published_date": "2017-04-23T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "abstract": "The plan would expand Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s signature program slowly, starting in two districts, in the Bronx and Brooklyn, next year.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/nyregion/de-blasio-pre-k-expansion.html", "source": "The New York Times"}
