{"updated_date": "2017-04-19T12:00:06-04:00", "text": "The State of New Jersey is moving to revoke or suspend the license of a prominent psychologist, accusing him of failing to prevent details of patients\u2019 mental health diagnoses and treatments from being disclosed when his practice sued them over unpaid bills. The complaint against the psychologist, Barry Helfmann, a past president of the New Jersey Psychological Association, followed a ProPublica story published in The New York Times in December 2015 that described the lawsuits and the information they contained. The complaint was filed by the state attorney general\u2019s office on April 7 with the New Jersey State Board of Psychological Examiners. It accuses Dr. Helfmann of failing to take reasonable steps to protect patients\u2019 confidentiality, failing to keep notes about certain patient visits, failing to release records requested by a patient and failing to supervise office staff about patient confidentiality and preserving patient records. Dr. Helfmann, the complaint says, \u201crepeatedly failed to protect the personal health information of his own clients.\u201d The allegations encompass Dr. Helfmann\u2019s own patients as well as those of his colleagues at Short Hills Associates in Clinical Psychology, a practice where he is the managing partner. ProPublica identified 24 court cases filed by Short Hills Associates from 2010 to 2014 seeking payments in which patients\u2019 names, diagnoses and the treatments they received were listed in documents. The defendants included lawyers, business people and a manager at a nonprofit. In cases involving patients who were minors, Dr. Helfmann\u2019s practice sued their parents and included the children\u2019s names and diagnoses. After one patient filed a suit against Dr. Helfmann and his practice over the disclosures, the details of all patients were redacted from the court records. That patient\u2019s lawsuit has been settled; the terms are confidential. In an interview, Dr. Helfmann vigorously disputed the allegations and said he would contest the complaint. He said he relied upon the expertise of his lawyers in pursuing patient payments and has filed a legal malpractice case against the firm. \u201cWe never authorized, we were never aware, nor would we have authorized the fact that they appended a copy of the bill to the lawsuit,\u201d Dr. Helfmann said, adding that he only learned of it when the patient sued over the disclosure. \u201cWe were completely in the dark.\u201d Jeffrey Rothbard, a lawyer for the firm Rothbard, Rothbard, Kohn & Kellar, which is the target of the suit by Dr. Helfmann and Short Hills Associates, declined to comment. In the firm\u2019s response to the complaint, its lawyers deny any wrongdoing. Dr. Helfmann has also filed a lawsuit against the state psychology board and Joan D. Gelber, a senior deputy state attorney general, accusing them of violating his rights. And he has filed a grievance against Ms. Gelber with the New Jersey Office of Attorney Ethics, asserting that she misrepresented her inquiry into the matter, used inflammatory language in legal documents and sought to blame him for his lawyers\u2019 actions. A spokesman for the state declined to comment on behalf of both the psychology board and Ms. Gelber. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the patient privacy law better known as Hipaa, requires health providers to disclose only the minimum information necessary if they sue patients over unpaid bills. But the law did not apply to Short Hills Associates because it covers only providers who submit data electronically, which the practice did not at the time. It now does Dr. Helfmann sent the state psychology board a letter from Alan Nessman, senior special counsel for legal and regulatory affairs at the American Psychological Association, noting that psychologists are not legal experts. \u201cWe generally recommend that our member psychologists rely on the advice of counsel in their state with appropriate expertise, particularly when the legal issues are complex,\u201d Mr. Nessman wrote. Dr. Helfmann is a leader in the field of psychology. He is president-elect of the American Group Psychotherapy Association, whose chief executive, Marsha Block, said she and the board were aware of the state\u2019s complaint. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s clear, what\u2019s not clear at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is far from resolved.\u201d Dr. Helfmann said his reputation and his practice had suffered because of the accusations against him. He said he had a long track record as a defender of patient privacy: He was a leading advocate for a New Jersey law limiting the information an insurance company can seek from a psychologist to determine the medical necessity of a treatment. And in 2010, he was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against two insurance companies and a New Jersey state commission, accusing them of requiring psychologists to turn over their treatment notes in order to get paid. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire career advocating for patient privacy in many, many endeavors,\u201d Dr. Helfmann said. \u201cAnd to be accused of something I didn\u2019t do around patient privacy, which is a sacred tenet of what a psychologist does, is terrible.\u2019\u2019 Andrew Thomasson, a lawyer representing the patient who sued Dr. Helfmann over revealing personal information, disagreed. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that the state is following up on what has happened and understands the seriousness of the actions taken by Dr. Helfmann,\u201d Mr. Thomasson said. \u201cI think the attorney general\u2019s complaint undermines the truth of Dr. Helfmann\u2019s claims.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/nyregion/new-jersey-says-psychologist-failed-to-prevent-disclosure-of-patient-data.html", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "The state is moving to revoke or suspend the license of Barry Helfmann, whose patients\u2019 mental health diagnoses and treatments were disclosed when his practice sued them over unpaid bills.", "title": "New Jersey Says Psychologist Failed to Prevent Disclosure of Patient Data", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T12:00:06-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
