{"abstract": "Gaia Pianigiani\u2019s grandfather died under the same conditions as the subject of a front-page story that she wrote.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "\u201cI just wanted to know how Paola died,\u201d Stefano Arcuri told me gazing down. The moment that gentle man walked into the trade union\u2019s room in downtown Taranto, where Nadia Shira Cohen, our photographer, and I were waiting for him, I knew why he initially resisted our invitation to meet. In my eyes, Mr. Acuri\u2019s wife, Paola Clemente, is one of the most powerful figures in recent Italian labor history: Two years ago, at 49, her heart stopped beating in the scorching summer heat of Italy\u2019s south while she was sorting table grapes. She was paid a third of the national salary and was working over 150 kilometers (around 90 miles) away from home. Thanks partly to the Clemente family and their quest for truth, the horrendous working conditions of so many Italian agricultural workers has recently become part of the national political discourse. Less interested in politics, Mr. Arcuri simply wanted to know what happened to his wife of 27 years. His query resonated with me for a very personal reason: It was the same hope my grandmother and her four children have nourished since the October day in 1973 when my grandfather Dario, like Ms. Clemente, died working in an Italian vineyard. My grandfather harvested red wine grapes on the farm he worked with my grandmother; together they snipped Sangiovese grapes from the vines. They placed the grapes in big baskets that were loaded on a tractor and carted into a cellar. Perhaps it was the slope of the Tuscan hills combined with some human error in maneuvering the tractor: The cart plunged forward and hit my grandfather on the head, killing him on the spot. His lifeless body, covered by a white blanket, lay in the vineyard for hours, awaiting forensics and some legal authorization that in Italy seems to always come too late. Police kept my mother and her two sisters away while they waited for the authorities, but my family members vividly remember the scene and reconstructed it with their children, and with me, my brother and my cousins. My mother told us she had had a premonition that morning, while she was sewing in the tailor\u2019s shop where she and her sister worked. For years afterward, tears filled her eyes every time she recounted that omen, that morning. Days after the incident, some of my grandfather\u2019s colleagues told our family that the landlord\u2019s nephew was driving the tractor when the cart started rolling forward, but police did not look into it very carefully. \u201cWe were alone and had no economic or legal power at the time,\u201d my mother answered me when I asked why they didn\u2019t call for an investigation into the accident. \u201cThe landlord had money, and a name. We were just farmers.\u201d We still don\u2019t know exactly what caused my grandfather\u2019s death. Labor laws are much more protective now and, had he died more recently, perhaps there would have been a thorough investigation or court verdict that settled what exactly had happened. Forty-three years ago, however, a number of questions \u2014 and a potent sense of injustice \u2014 followed my grandfather\u2019s lifeless body out of the vineyard. My grandmother, who later developed diabetes, maintained a clear memory of the days she and her gentle husband worked together in the Chianti countryside. Agricultural workers\u2019 rights in Italy have come a long way. In the 1950s, my father\u2019s father marched through the streets of my hilltop village in Chianti to protest the working conditions of the same men and women who had helped liberate Italy during World War II. For months, he woke up with the sunrise, fed the animals and left the farm to join the grass-root strikes of sharecroppers who eventually earned more rights for farmers all over Italy. Last year, and partly in response to the conversation that the Clemente family started after Paola died in the vineyard, Italy approved a long-awaited law protecting Italy\u2019s agricultural workers from exploitation. Last March, hoping to talk with Ms. Clemente\u2019s colleagues, Mr. Arcuri, Nadia and I knocked on the doors of some of her female co-workers, most of whom continued to operate under the same conditions in which she had died. None of them opened the door. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them,\u201d Mr. Arcuri said while we walked out of a building with the old paint falling down to the sidewalk. \u201cThey need to support their families.\u201d Driving our rental car through the roads of Apulia, after I had finished my reporting for a page one story about dire working conditions in southern Italy, I thought about the ways in which my grandfather had been more fortunate than Ms. Clemente. He\u2019d had a decent salary and had worked near his home. In a Group of 7 country, it is unthinkable to have thousands of migrants and Italians working under those conditions in many fields. Ms. Clemente\u2019s and my grandfather\u2019s stories were similar, but matters have evolved over the decades: The men who exploited Ms. Clemente were arrested and will stand trial in Apulia. Her family may receive answers \u2014 and justice \u2014 denied my family.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/insider/reporters-personal-connection-to-the-story-she-wrote-about-modern-italian-slavery.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T16:05:04-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Reporter\u2019s Personal Connection to the Story She Wrote About Modern Italian \u2018Slavery\u2019", "created_date": "2017-04-18T16:05:04-04:00", "section": "Times Insider"}
