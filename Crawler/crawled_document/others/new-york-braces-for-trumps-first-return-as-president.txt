On May 4, Donald J. Trump is coming back to New York for the first time since moving into the White House. The president will visit the U.S.S. Intrepid, the decommissioned aircraft carrier on the West Side of Manhattan, according to Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. There, he will meet with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia to commemorate the 75th anniversary of a naval battle the countries fought side by side during World War II. And the city, where protests against Trump policies have erupted in its parks, airports, schools, churches, synagogues, mosques, museums, restaurants and streets, to name just a few locations, is girding for what, in the inflamed atmosphere, may be a battle of its own. \u201cThe Mayor embraces this as an opportunity to remind the President that New York is the greatest city in the world because of, not in spite of, our diversity and inclusiveness,\u201d said Eric Phillips, spokesman for the mayor. The New York City Police Department, he said, \u201cis plenty prepared to handle the president\u2019s security and the expected outpouring of New Yorkers who look forward to greeting him.\u201d At 5:56 p.m. on Tuesday, organizers for the Working Families Party got word of the visit via Twitter. By 6:02 p.m., they had agreed to hold a protest the day he returns, said Nelini Stamp, the party\u2019s national membership director. In less than 24 hours since the event was posted on the group\u2019s Facebook page and with protest plans still being figured out, more than 2,000 people had expressed interest in going. \u201cWe want to make it as difficult as possible for him to be able to just walk onto the Intrepid and give this speech,\u201d Ms. Stamp said. \u201cWe want to make sure he knows he can\u2019t just come back again,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a homecoming.\u201d The New York Police Department has estimated that it will cost $308,000 a day to protect the president when he is in town. \u201cWe recognize that this will be the president\u2019s first official visit to New York City since taking office,\u201d said Stephen P. Davis, the chief spokesman for the police, in an email, \u201cand the N.Y.P.D. will assign the resources necessary for the security of this event.\u201d Robert John Burck, who performs regularly in Times Square in his underwear as the iconic Naked Cowboy, has been an ardent, public supporter of Mr. Trump, but he said lately he has been compelled to swap out his Trump-branded underwear for plain briefs because of the hostile, anti-Trump climate in the city. His wife made him three briefs with the word \u201cTrump\u201d on the back to be worn on the special occasion of Mr. Trump\u2019s return, he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t bow and cow to anyone, and that\u2019s what a leader is,\u201d Mr. Burck said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to not come to his own city, the place he was born, because a bunch of people are being dramatic? Let the whole entire city stand up against him! I think he would go right down the middle of the street just as normal.\u201d It is unclear if Mr. Trump will stay at his penthouse triplex in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue where his wife, Melania, and son Barron live. He may instead choose to stay at his country house in New Jersey, on the grounds of the Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, about an hour\u2019s drive from New York in the middle of horse country. The 1939 red brick Georgian Revival mansion has been referred to as Mr. Trump\u2019s Camp David North. He met there with candidates for his cabinet during his time as president-elect. The township is still waiting to be reimbursed by the federal government for those earlier stays, when it spent $300,000, drafting some of its 16-member police force to help protect Mr. Trump, according to Bedminster\u2019s part-time mayor, Steven E. Parker, a Republican who owns a local airport. The 500-acre golf course sits behind an iron gate on winding Lamington Road, surrounded by horse farms. And while Mr. Trump won the township by a slim margin of about 40 votes, the mayor does not expect the same sort of demonstrations for which the city is bracing. \u201cI am sure there will be a lot of curiosity seekers, but as I look at the lay of the land in Bedminster, we are not like New York City,\u201d Mr. Parker said. Over the iron gates of the golf club, there is little to see, and few but neighboring horses to pay a demonstrator much attention. \u201cIf you want to protest, you want to be seen,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong, but I don\u2019t see a great venue that would be effective if you were somebody who wanted to put up signs that either you love him or don\u2019t love him.\u201d Aboard the Intrepid, Mr. Trump will be meeting Mr. Turnbull in person for the first time since a terse phone call in February between the two leaders ended abruptly over Mr. Trump\u2019s unwillingness to abide by an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees being held in an Australian detention center. The event will commemorate the 75th anniversary of Battle of the Coral Sea, in which the United States and Australia fought Japan. Vice President Mike Pence met with Mr. Turnbull in Sydney last week. Mr. Trump has a long relationship with the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum. He has donated to the museum and he landed his helicopter on the flight deck during an episode of his reality television show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d said Bill White, a former president of the museum. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to hear he\u2019s visiting and bringing awareness to the Intrepid yet again,\u201d Mr. White, who is a major Democratic Party fund-raiser, said in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s no bigger honor than having the president of the United States come to visit.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T11:28:33-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "abstract": "The president\u2019s usual security requirements will be complicated by the throngs sure to turn out in protest as he meets the Australian prime minister aboard the Intrepid.", "item_type": "Article"}
