{"updated_date": "2017-04-19T11:55:01-04:00", "text": "Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s far-right National Front party, is expected to produce a strong showing in France\u2019s first round of presidential elections on April 23. Her campaign is emblematic of a growing movement of far-right parties across Europe and the globe. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s promise to give \u201cFrance its freedom back, and give the people a voice\u201d is echoed in nationalist, populist rally cries worldwide. In this lesson, students will analyze the growth of far-right  movements in Europe and around the world. They will explore the movements\u2019 geneses, uncover their core messages and compare and contrast their leaders across time and place. _________ Warm Up: Voices from Europe\u2019s Far Right In the past few years Europe\u2019s far-right parties have achieved electoral success unseen since World War II. While the particularities of each party vary from nation to nation, they share underlying messages of national pride and xenophobia. At the core of their platforms is the belief that the political establishment has failed to provide for its people. Far-right party leaders call for a new era of politics powered by the people for the people, though their definition of \u201cthe people\u201d is narrow, limited to a nativist ideology. The establishment finds the far right\u2019s success at the polls inconceivable, but the far right claims that their popularity is not without precedent. They point to the failures of globalization, stagnant economies and rising immigration, particularly from Muslim nations, as the sources of their progress. Part 1 We begin the lesson with Time Magazine\u2019s short video \u201cVoices from Europe\u2019s Far Right.\u201d As students watch, we invite them to create a See-Think-Wonder chart and to consider the following questions: \u2022 What images or symbols do you see?\u2022 What words or phrases do you see and hear?\u2022 What issues do you think are at the heart of Europe\u2019s far-right movements?\u2022 What questions do you have about the far right in Europe? After viewing the video one or two times, we encourage students to share their observations, ideas and questions. Record student questions on a poster to drive the inquiry process throughout the lesson. Part 2 Last spring The Times asked readers who support far-right parties in Europe to tell us why they had turned away from mainstream political movements. Share these excerpts from \u201cVoices from Europe\u2019s Far Right\u201d with students. We suggest dividing students into groups of 3-4 to read and discuss the perspectives shared. Ask students to discuss: \u2022 Who is the person? How old is he or she? What is his or her profession?\u2022 Which issue(s) is most compelling for him or her? Why?\u2022 What is the context surrounding this issue? We then invite students to share some of their examples, focusing on the question: What issues are most important for supporters of the far right? As students share, write a list of the issues on the board for them to refer to throughout the lesson. _________ Activity: Perception vs. Reality  Lee Atwater, a political strategist who worked on George Bush\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign, coined the phrase \u201cperception is reality\u201d to describe the power of making people believe something regardless of the facts. Far-right leaders today have been accused of exploiting this strategy, tapping into people\u2019s fears to create the perception of looming disaster. Their talk of economic decline, terrorism and a loss of \u201ctraditional European values\u201d has been seen as instilling a sense of anxiety that supersedes truth. In a March episode of the Times podcast \u201cThe Daily,\u201d Michael Barbaro sat down with the Times columnists Amanda Taub and Max Fisher to distill perception from reality in a discussion of what\u2019s driving political change in Europe. Ms. Taub and Mr. Fisher argue that this movement is more about immigration, demographics and identity than the economy. We provide a listening guide, which we suggest reviewing with students before beginning the program. We also recommend pausing every 2-3 minutes to quickly check for understanding and give students time to record any thoughts. The listening guide is divided into two sections. If your time is limited, the first six minutes provide the essential information about the rise of the far right in Europe. If time permits, continue listening for a more detailed analysis of the situation. Listening Guide: 1-6 minutes 1. What message does Geert Wilders, a far-right politician in the Netherlands, communicate about Islam?2. What is the perception of why far-right movements are ascending in Europe, according to Ms. Taub and Mr. Fisher, who write the Interpreter column for The Times?3. What is the real explanation for the rise of far-right parties in Europe, according to Ms. Taub and Mr. Fisher? What do far-right supporters feel they are losing? Why?4. How is the far right in Europe different from the right in the United States?5. What role does immigration play in the growth of the far right in Europe? Listening Guide: 6-14 minutes 6. What does the Somali example show about scarcity and identity?7. How does the far right take advantage of people\u2019s perception of immigration in Europe?8. Why have far-right parties made gains in white working-class suburbs just outside of cities where refugees live? What is this called? 9. How have populist candidates affected mainstream political parties? To bolster this work, students can read Ms. Taub\u2019s article explaining how a sleepy German suburb provides clues about the rise of Europe\u2019s far-right movements. And they can analyze the charts in this Times article illustrating how right-wing parties in a growing number of European countries have made electoral gains over the past two decades. Wrap Up: Discuss the following questions: \u2022 For what are far-right movements in Europe fighting (or against)? \u2022 Why are they gaining popularity across Europe?\u2022 Do they present a threat to democracy and civil liberties in Europe? Why or why not? _________ Going Further 1. Examining an Election In this part of the lesson, students will play the role of journalist as they try to gather the facts about the issues at stake in the presidential election in France. Their task is to separate perception from reality and to paint a more accurate picture of the current situation in France and across Europe. Before beginning this activity, you may need to build background about multiparty political systems and the electoral process in Europe. This video from the Financial Times introduces the policies of the most prominent candidates, and this video provides a brief explanation of the French election process. In short, five leading candidates are vying for power in the first round of elections on April 23. If no candidate secures 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will take place between the two leading candidates on May 7. You also may want to watch the above 12-minute Times documentary from March 2016 as a class. It explains how in France the far-right National Front has hammered at the political mainstream for decades, to limited effect. But a surge of migrants into Europe, as well as a series of deadly terrorist attacks in France and elsewhere, \u201chave left the National Front with the political winds at its back, after years of trying to sanitize its image as an extremist party.\u201d When students have enough background to begin their research, they can work in pairs or small groups to learn about the issues at the heart of the elections in France. You might decide to have each pair or small group focus on one candidate, and then share their research with the rest of the class. Or, you might instead have different members of a group learn about different candidates, before sharing what they learned with the rest of their group. Either way, the goal is to have students understand each candidate\u2019s perspective. Students can use this BBC guide to the French elections as a starting point for their research. Here are some questions to help drive their investigation: \u2022 Who is the candidate?\u2022 What is his or her political background?\u2022 What is his or her vision for the future of France?\u2022 Who supports the candidate? Why?\u2022 Who opposes this candidate? Why?\u2022 On which issues does the candidate focus (e.g., immigration, globalization, terrorism)?\u2022 What do other reliable sources say about the issues?\u2022 What impact has the candidate or party had on France so far? \u2022 What impact could the candidate or party have on France in the future? We recommend consulting our lesson plan \u201cEvaluating Sources in a \u2018Post Truth\u2019 World\u201d to help students find reliable sources as they conduct their research. You can give students a choice about how they wish to present their findings, with options including but not limited to a newspaper article, podcast, video news segment or debate.

Weaknesses in Democracy In a recent Interpreter column, Amanda Taub writes: She then investigates what she calls \u201cthe most common way for a democracy to collapse\u201d in today\u2019s world \u2014 through the actions of an elected incumbent, not a coup or revolution. Have students read Ms. Taub\u2019s analysis, and then consider the following questions, for writing and discussion: 1. What role do checks and balances play within a strong democracy? Are they essential? And, why is it dangerous when a democratically elected leader claims popular support for changes that undermine democratic institutions, such as stripping away checks and balances? 2. What role does a free press play within a strong democracy? Is it essential? Is it dangerous when democratically elected leaders curtail press freedom or spread misinformation? Why? 3. Does democracy need an opposition party or leaders? Why is it dangerous when an elected leader limits the opposition\u2019s ability to campaign or systematically shuts off political opportunities for the opposition? 4. Are democratic elections an effective check on tyranny? And how are deeply polarized societies particularly susceptible to sliding from democracy to autocracy? 5. What do you think citizens in a democracy should do to strengthen democratic traditions and institutions and prevent the possibility of an authoritarian regime taking control? Why? 3. Far-right Nationalism or Fascism? In an interview this January with Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, Pope Francis warned against the dangers of populism, citing the rise of Hitler in Germany in the 1930s. \u201cBut the case of Germany in 1933 is typical,\u201d he said, \u201ca people who were immersed in a crisis, who were searching for their identity until this charismatic leader came and promised to give their identity back, and he gave them a distorted identity, and we all know what happened.\u201d In the wake of Brexit, Donald Trump\u2019s election and the growth of far-right populist parties across Europe, there has been much debate over whether the movements we see today are setting the world on a path toward a new era of global fascism. In fact, Peter Baker\u2019s May 2016 article connects the rise of Donald Trump to a growing debate over global fascism. He writes: In this extension lesson, students compare and contrast contemporary populist or nationalist leaders with authoritarian or fascist leaders in history to determine at what point nationalism and populism become authoritarian or fascist governments. First, ask students to define four key terms: fascism, authoritarianism, populism and nationalism. How do the definitions overlap in some ways? And how are they different? Then, ask students to choose a fascist or authoritarian leader from the past, perhaps one they have studied in class, and then select a contemporary political figure who has displayed strongman tactics or who has risen to power on a message of extreme national pride and xenophobia. We have created this Venn diagram to help students compare and contrast the two different leaders. Encourage students to use our archives as a resource to find articles about the two political figures. Challenge them to find articles published at the time the leaders were in power, like this 1933 article (PDF) about Adolf Hitler\u2019s economic program, in which he is quoted saying, \u201cThe German people has found itself, it will no longer suffer those who are not for Germany.\u201d If students are having a difficult time choosing a current politician, they might find inspiration in the Times article, \u201cAuthoritarian Leaders Greet Trump as One of Their Own.\u201d The article mentions eight politicians outside of the United States, including Vladimir V. Putin (Russia), Rodrigo Duterte (Philippines), Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkey) and Viktor Orban (Hungary). To close this lesson, engage students in a discussion of the revival of fascism in today\u2019s world. Based on evidence from their research, ask students to discuss: \u2022 Are we entering a new era of global fascism? If so, how do we know? \u2022 Is it useful to look for analogies between the fascism and authoritarianism of the past and the politics of today? Why or why not? \u2022 Is this question unique to Europe or should it be a global discussion? _________ Related Lesson Plans Tragedy in the Mediterranean: Learning About Europe\u2019s Immigration Crisis Analyzing Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban: A Lesson Plan Text to Text: Comparing Jewish Refugees of the 1930s With Syrian Refugees Today Resources | The Attacks in Paris", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/learning/lesson-plans/echoes-of-history-a-lesson-plan-about-the-recent-rise-of-europes-far-right-parties.html", "section": "The Learning Network", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "In this lesson, students will analyze the growth of far-right movements in Europe and around the world.", "title": "Echoes of History?
