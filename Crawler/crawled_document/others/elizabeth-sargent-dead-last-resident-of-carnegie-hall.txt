She was 96. Her friend Billy Lyons said she died at her new apartment, on West 56th Street, within a block of Carnegie Hall. She had been bedridden for the past few years, he said. The honeycomb of more than 100 studios was added to Carnegie Hall several years after Andrew Carnegie completed the structure, at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, in 1891. They became home, working space or both to generations of musicians, writers, artists and actors, among them Enrico Caruso, James Dean, Martha Graham, Marilyn Monroe and Katharine Hepburn. Ms. Sargent joined their ranks in 1964, the year after she published her first book, \u201cThe African Boy,\u201d under the name E. N. Sargent. The poet and critic Kenneth Rexroth wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1964 that the book was \u201ccertainly the equal of most contemporary African verse in technical mastery and convincing air,\u201d even if much of the material presumably \u201ccomes from anthropological reading rather than experience.\u201d Ms. Sargent was white. For Ms. Sargent, Carnegie Hall was as much sanctuary as studio. She moved there to distance herself from an abusive husband who drank, she said. Her starting rent for Studio 901, a well-lighted apartment with a lofted bedroom, was $188 a month. She had used the writer and critic Malcolm Cowley and the poet John Hall Wheelock as references. \u201cMark Twain used to smoke his pipe in the author\u2019s club across the hall from Ms. Sargent\u2019s studio; Marlon Brando entertained guests in the apartment directly below; and Leonard Bernstein read scores on the same floor,\u201d The New York Times said of Ms. Sargent\u2019s studio when she left in 2010. \u201cNorman Mailer penned works in her apartment, and Isadora Duncan danced down the hallway.\u201d Ms. Sargent led a quiet life there for more than four decades, during which she wrote \u201cA Woman in Love\u201d (1977), a novel based on her life, and published poems in magazines including The New Yorker and Cosmopolitan. They were collected in \u201cThe Love Poems of Elizabeth Sargent\u201d and \u201cThe Magic Book of Love Exercises.\u201d Her work was known for its frank description of sexuality and its slant rhymes, as in these lines from her poem \u201cWaiting\u201d: I know my breasts would burn for you, who\u2019dHave thought the world turns dark, for love, becauseyou fit meLike a hand in a soft glove, or that I\u2019d bleedFor you, and send wires, which you hate, and makeTelephone calls I needYour words, your laughter, your soul BreakMy bones if I lie I was wildWhen you left. Shock? Amputation? a miscarried child? Ms. Sargent left Carnegie Hall after a three-year struggle with the Carnegie Hall Corporation, which wanted to demolish the studios to create educational and rehearsal space. She accepted a cash settlement of about $2 million to move from the studio, for which she paid $337 a month in 2009. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m leaving the place,\u201d Ms. Sargent said in 2010. \u201cI feel the place is leaving me.\u201d The last days for tenants were captured in \u201cLost Bohemia,\u201d a 2011 documentary by Josef Astor, who had a studio in the building. Two of Ms. Sargent\u2019s contemporaries \u2014 Bill Cunningham, renowned for his photographs of fashion on the street, and Editta Sherman, famed for her portrait photographs of celebrities \u2014 were prominent in the film. Ms. Sargent is only heard, leaving a series of messages on Mr. Astor\u2019s answering machine. \u201cAn anonymous, unseen poet who lives above Mr. Astor and leaves him eloquent phone messages observes that studios and the hall below, though commissioned by a plutocrat, \u2018were built not on power, but on love,\u2019\u201d A. O. Scott of The Times wrote in a review. \u201cThe power of this documentary resides in that proud and fragile sentiment.\u201d Mr. Lyons said that Ms. Sargent was unhappy in her new apartment and that she had stopped writing poetry after she left Carnegie Hall. By her account, she was born Betty Bernardine Robinson to an impoverished mining family on May 16, 1920, in coal country in West Virginia or Pennsylvania. She was adopted by a Quaker couple in Cleveland \u2014 Paul Bickel, a lawyer, and Ruth Titus \u2014 when she was 16 months old. The family soon moved to Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up. She graduated from high school there, encouraged by an English and theater teacher named Elbert Sargent, whose surname she later adopted. She studied theater at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), where she met a young German actor, Hans Freund, who was in Pittsburgh on a short-term visa. They eloped in 1940 so he would not be deported to Germany, and he fought for the United States during World War II. The marriage ended in divorce shortly after the war. After a brief marriage to a man in Argentina, Ms. Sargent met Allan Roberts, a ballroom dancer and military veteran. They married in the mid-1950s and moved to Dallas, where Ms. Sargent became a book reviewer for The Dallas Morning News. They returned to New York in the late 1950s and settled in Leonia, N.J., where they had a son, Jared Roberts. He died in 1992. Ms. Sargent is survived by a daughter, Serena Sorensen. Ms. Sargent began researching her first book after using the proceeds from a poem she had sold to purchase an African sculpture of a boy. But after the book was published her husband became increasingly violent, she said, and she moved to Carnegie Hall. They never divorced. Mr. Roberts died in 1976. The Carnegie Hall renovations were completed in 2014. Most of the space that was Ms. Sargent\u2019s studio is now taken up by a vestibule and a freight elevator.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T22:35:39-04:00", "abstract": "When Ms. Sargent, whose work was known for its frank description of sexuality and its slant rhymes, moved in 2010, it marked the end of an artist enclave.", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T22:35:39-04:00"}
