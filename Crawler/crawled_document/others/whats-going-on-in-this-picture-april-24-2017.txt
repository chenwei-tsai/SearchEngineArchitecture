After looking closely at the image above (or at the full-size image), think about these three questions: \u2022 What is going on in this picture? \u2022 What do you see that makes you say that? \u2022 What more can you find? 2. Next, join the conversation by clicking on the comment button and posting in the box that opens on the right. (Students 13 and older are invited to comment, although teachers of younger students are welcome to post what their students have to say.) 3. After you have posted, try reading back to see what others have said, then respond to someone else by posting another comment. Use the \u201cReply\u201d button or the @ symbol to address that student directly. Each Monday, our collaborator, Visual Thinking Strategies, will facilitate a discussion from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern time by paraphrasing comments and linking to responses to help students\u2019 understanding go deeper. You might use their responses as models for your own. 4. On Thursday afternoons, we will reveal at the bottom of this post more information about the photo. How does reading the caption and learning its back story help you see the image differently? _________ More? \u2022 See all images in this series or a slide show of 40 of our favorite images. \u2022 Learn how other teachers use it. \u2022 Read our introductory post. \u2022 Find out about the philosophy, curriculum and professional development opportunities offered by Visual Thinking Strategies. _________", "published_date": "2017-04-23T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "The Learning Network", "abstract": "Look closely at this image, stripped of its caption, and join the moderated conversation about what you and other students see.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-picture-april-24-2017.html", "source": "The New York Times"}
