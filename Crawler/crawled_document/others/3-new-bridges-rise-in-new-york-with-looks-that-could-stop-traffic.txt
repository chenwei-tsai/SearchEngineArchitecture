{"text": "New York, the city of perpetual arrival, is getting three new gateways: diaphanous cable-stayed bridges that look almost too ethereal to bear the load of thousands of vehicles and people each day. They are already transforming the skyline. With luck, they may even improve the drive. In the last half-century, while New York was out of the bridge-building business, cable-stayed bridges were proliferating around the world. They were relatively easy and economical to build. And they almost couldn\u2019t help but look beautiful, with their slender pylons and radiating cables. It\u2019s as though a race of giant harp makers had been roaming the planet, threading it together with gossamer strands of steel. They simply hadn\u2019t reached New York \u2014 until now. On Thursday night, traffic between Brooklyn and Queens is to begin crossing the Newtown Creek on the first of two parallel cable-stayed bridges that are replacing the deeply loathed Kosciuszko Bridge, an ungainly 78-year-old trusswork contraption. Rather than being enmeshed in a creaky Erector Set, drivers on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway will travel between two tapered concrete pylons that rise from the Brooklyn shore and open like arms to embrace the sky. Just 56 cables, splayed outward from the pylons, support the six-lane bridge deck, which is 90 feet above mean high water \u2014 or 35 feet lower than the current bridge, which required infamously steep approach ramps. This summer, the original Kosciuszko is to be demolished, almost instantaneously, in a controlled explosion. A second bridge deck, hung from a second pair of pylons on the Queens side, will take its place. The $825 million project is to be finished in early 2020. But wait, there\u2019s more. In a few months, the first of two cable-stayed crossings is to open over the Arthur Kill, between Staten Island and Elizabeth, N.J., replacing the Goethals Bridge. Then, in 2018, the New New York Bridge, also a parallel cable-stayed design, is set to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson River, about 10 miles north of the Bronx. All three bridge projects are rising on the watch of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the State Department of Transportation (builders of the Kosciuszko), the New York State Thruway Authority (the Tappan Zee) and, with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (the Goethals). Cable-stayed technology, Mr. Cuomo said, will ensure that the new bridges \u201cstand the test of time.\u201d That sounds like a good bet. The technology has been on conspicuous display since 1883. In John A. Roebling\u2019s hybrid design for the Brooklyn Bridge, the diagonal cables that lend so much drama to the structure were intended to help stay the bridge deck \u2014 that is, to keep it rigid. Vertical suspender cables held up the deck, transferring its weight to giant suspension cables and out to enormous anchorages. Stay cables did not prove necessary. Thereafter, the pure suspension bridge reigned supreme. The Williamsburg, Manhattan, George Washington, Bronx-Whitestone and Throgs Neck Bridges were all suspension bridges, as was the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge of 1964, perhaps the last of its kind. \u201cWe haven\u2019t built big bridges in a while, and the cable-stayed type emerged during that while,\u201d said Guy Nordenson, a prominent structural engineer in New York and a professor at Princeton. (New York has at least two small cable-stayed pedestrian bridges.) In the meantime, cable-stayed bridges have crossed Tampa Bay in Florida, the Mississippi River in Louisiana, the Charles River in Massachusetts and the Cooper River in South Carolina. They have risen in Mexico and Canada; in Spain, Russia, Norway, Greece, Germany and France; in Vietnam, South Korea, Japan and China \u2014 indeed, all over China. When plans for the new Kosciuszko Bridge were being developed in 2010, nearby neighborhoods were asked about four bridge types: cable-stayed; through arch, like the Hell Gate Bridge; deck arch; and box girder. Of the 121 people who submitted comments to the transportation agency, 53 preferred a cable-stayed bridge and 37 the through arch. \u201cThe stakeholders\u2019 advisory committee was overwhelmingly looking for something that stood out,\u201d said Phil Eng, the former executive deputy commissioner and chief engineer of the state transportation agency, who is now chief operating officer of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. \u201cThe cable-stayed option provides the most dramatic visual experience for bridge users and for the local communities in both Brooklyn and Queens,\u201d the transportation agency said in a 2011 report. The bridge, it said, will \u201cact as a visual landmark for New York City.\u201d Bridge engineers, designers and erectors see other advantages. \u201cThe cable-stayed bridge is a relatively simple bridge to build,\u201d said Larry Gillman, the project director for the joint venture \u2014 Skanska USA, Kiewit and ECCO III Enterprises \u2014 that is constructing the first span and demolishing the existing bridge. The architect is Bradley C. Touchstone. Construction of the second bridge will be under a separate contract. Work began in 2014. Eight drilled reinforced foundations were installed, four for each pylon, reaching 180 to 220 feet down to bedrock. The pylons are built of solid concrete up to the height of the bridge deck. After that, they turn into hollow tubes with stairs inside for access to the cable anchorages and to the beacons required by the Federal Aviation Administration. Between the twin 287-foot-high pylons is a \u201cpier table\u201d \u2014 the crossbar in a giant H. It is strong enough that a 20-foot length of bridge deck could be cantilevered from it, like a rigid diving board, and remain hanging in air until secured to the pylons by a pair of cables. This asymmetrical load on one side of the pylons placed stress on the structure. To correct the imbalance, the next deck section and cables were installed on the opposite side of the pylons. The structure was in equilibrium again. Back and forth, the deck grew. Then, an inherent imbalance had to be corrected, since the main span is 624 feet long, while the back span, on the other side of the pylons, is only 377 feet long. To compensate, a 4,000-ton counterweight of concrete and steel plates was added under the shorter section. In contrast with the existing bridge, comprising 22 trusses with joints every 160 feet or so, the new \u201cK Bridge\u201d \u2014 as officials call it in order not to have to pronounce \u201cKosciuszko\u201d \u2014 has an uninterrupted 1,001-foot span. \u201cThere are no joints for water and salts to get into,\u201d Mr. Gilman said, promising far fewer maintenance headaches in decades to come. Until the second span is completed, the replacement bridge will carry six lanes of traffic, three in each direction. In the final configuration, it will carry five lanes of Queens-bound traffic. The four-lane Brooklyn-bound span will also have a pedestrian and bicycle path, affording a sweeping panorama of Manhattan from 1 World Trade Center to 432 Park Avenue. On April 18, the bridge looked almost ready to open, except for the oddly dissonant color of the five outermost cables, which are coated in a high-density polyethylene that looks orange, although it is officially described as burnt umber. \u201cIt will define the bridge shape against any color sky, where white cables might get lost,\u201d Robert Adams, the project director for the Transportation Department, explained. His point is well enough made, though it seems hard to believe that a new cable-stayed bridge will get lost on the New York skyline anytime soon.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/3-new-bridges-rise-in-new-york-with-looks-that-could-stop-traffic.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:37-04:00", "abstract": "The home of past-century wonders like the Brooklyn Bridge returns to building cable-stayed bridges, which are designed to \u201cstand the test of time.\u201d", "title": "3 New Bridges Rise in New York, With Looks That Could Stop Traffic"}
