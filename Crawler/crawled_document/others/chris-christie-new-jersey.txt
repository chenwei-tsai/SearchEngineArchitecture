Chris Christie has kept himself conspicuously busy. He celebrated the opening of a new drug treatment facility. He delved into the intricacies of the Mets\u2019 pitching rotation on a sports radio station. He dropped by the Prudential Center to warn children about the dangers of drug addiction. This is not how he thought it would end, running out the calendar with largely dutiful tasks. \u201cWell, one, I thought I might be president,\u201d he said in an extended interview in his office earlier this month, \u201cso that\u2019s a fairly material change.\u201d With a 20 percent approval rating that secures his place among the most unliked governors in New Jersey history, the final nine months of the Christie administration, which began in 2010, reflect a governor in a dimming twilight. His legacy has been battered by a brazen political scandal known widely as Bridgegate; his once promising quest for the White House was profoundly quashed. Nonetheless, Mr. Christie aggressively defended what he said he had done for the state, and said he was focused on what he still wanted to accomplish. \u201cMy obit will be fine; I\u2019m not worried about that,\u201d Mr. Christie said in the interview. \u201cThe first graph of my obit will be pretty, pretty good, and my children and hopefully someday grandchildren will be able to read it and go, \u2018O.K., Grandpa lived a life of consequence.\u2019 That\u2019ll be good.\u201d But as he travels the state promoting his initiative against the opioid epidemic plaguing the country, the energy seems different. Gone are the throngs of national media who in 2013 thought they were covering the probable Republican presidential nominee. Gone are the nearly daily outrages and television clips of him berating an opponent or dressing down a lawmaker. In their place is a man keenly aware of his legacy, evident in the battles he chooses and in the reflexive defense against criticism. He has recently supplanted his small-government conservatism with populist rants against corporate America \u2014 Amtrak, United Airlines and Horizon health insurance were his most recent targets. The rhetoric is in line with the Trumpian politics of the moment, perhaps as a way to rehabilitate his image as he ponders his future. \u201cYou think about it, you go back prior to Bridgegate, his numbers were off the charts,\u201d said Stephen M. Sweeney, New Jersey\u2019s Senate president and a Democrat who has both sparred and collaborated with the governor. \u201cYou go from being loved to not being liked, it\u2019s pretty tough.\u201d Mr. Christie said he was not concerned with his approval ratings, only in being a \u201cgovernor of consequence,\u201d and that his final legislative ambitions may appear modest simply because of political realities: He is a governor on his way out, facing a risk-averse Legislature all up for election. He has signaled three main goals for his final year: getting Horizon \u2014 the state\u2019s largest health insurance carrier \u2014 to subsidize his drug program, shifting lottery revenue to shore up the heavily underfunded pension system and \u201ccementing\u201d the changes he\u2019s brought to drug and alcohol treatment and punishment. His main agenda item, combating the opioid epidemic plaguing his state and the country, is one he addressed during his 2009 initial run at the governorship. It also reignited his focus during his presidential campaign, when he spent weeks at a time in heroin-ravaged New Hampshire. \u201cI absolutely believe that, in part, that\u2019s the hand of God redeeming lives, and if you can be a part of that, it\u2019s a great thing,\u201d he said. It is an issue likely to provoke little opposition, and yet Mr. Christie seems to be marshaling his rhetoric behind it: He spent roughly 60 of his 75 minutes in his final State of the State address focused on the issue. \u201cIf you\u2019re in your last year you\u2019ve got to decide if you want to be uniting or divisive,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cI want to be uniting on the way out.\u201d For years, Mr. Christie carved an agenda from which he could build a path toward the White House. He took hard lines on spending, often sacrificing much-needed improvements to transportation infrastructure, which left many of his constituents furious this spring. He spent weeks at a time out of state building up his presidential run, drawing the ire of members of both parties and further dividing his state against him. And when he chose to endorse Mr. Trump, a candidate whom the more moderate Republicans of New Jersey abhorred, Mr. Christie saw his support in the state splinter further, though he professed not to worry because \u201cI knew I was never going to run in New Jersey again.\u201d All those choices were calculated to help the governor rise to the White House, either as president or vice president, a position he does not fail to mention he was considered for. \u201cTwice.\u201d \u201cI was doing what I thought was best for the country,\u201d he said of his endorsement of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd for me.\u201d His early support for Mr. Trump \u2014 he said he was receiving two to three calls a week from Mr. Trump, courting him \u2014 seemed sure to land him a top post in the White House, if not on the ticket. But as the Bridgegate guilty verdicts were handed up, Mr. Christie found himself shut out. Having failed to land a cabinet post, the governor has started to contemplate what he might consider doing after his term ends, musing aloud in an interview on various jobs he might be interested in \u2014 assuming his services were desired \u2014 so long as the price was right, of course. \u201cMight I associate with a law firm? Sure, or some type of other business or investment firm, maybe,\u201d he offered. \u201cMight I be involved in media? Sure. I enjoy that,\u201d he said (he had just finished three hours as a co-host of a sports radio talk show). \u201cCould I be involved to be on corporate boards? Sure, that\u2019s a possibility,\u201d he said, adding an important caveat: \u201cI want to have fun, and I want to make money. If I\u2019m not going to be in public service, then I want to make money.\u201d To be sure, Mr. Christie, 54, still believes that there may be a place for him in the Trump administration in the near future. (The governor is currently reading a biography of John Quincy Adams, prompting a minor fixation on the notion of finding different ways to serve the federal government.) Indeed, Mr. Christie still boasts of a close relationship with Mr. Trump, one that\u2019s based on 15 years of friendship and involves at least one extended phone conversation with the president each week, sometimes to talk policy, or sometimes just to talk. \u201cThere are other nights where we talk where we literally just don\u2019t talk about business at all,\u201d he said of his calls with the president. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll be shooting the bull about sports or some show he saw on television or a movie or whatever, or he\u2019ll be asking me about Mary Pat and the kids,\u201d a reference to his family. \u201cIt will be purely just a friendly conversation. And then at the end he might say, \u2018So how do you think I\u2019m doing? How do you think it\u2019s going?\u2019\u201d For the early part of his final year, Mr. Christie seemed intent on lying low \u2014 saying he wanted to dedicate his efforts to his drug initiative and counseling Mr. Trump \u2014 and pointedly avoiding needless public battles. \u201cYou know, in the beginning you come in, you\u2019re younger and you\u2019re less experienced and you\u2019re like, \u2018I want to fight everything,\u2019\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cAnd you learn over time that if you fight everything you may win nothing.\u201d In recent days, signs of the old Mr. Christie have re-emerged, although he seemed to be selecting weakened and universally loathed opponents. First he picked on Amtrak, channeling his constituents\u2019 rage through harsh letters that threatened the punitive action of withholding payments from New Jersey Transit. He also appeared on cable news to criticize Amtrak after its rails were found to have caused the derailment of a New Jersey Transit train at Pennsylvania Station \u2014 causing weeklong delays and cancellations across the region. Then he turned on United Airlines \u2014 the company that happened to be at the center of a bribery scandal involving his close friend, David Samson \u2014 over its recent treatment of a forcibly removed passenger. But he saved his harshest rhetoric for perhaps his most hated adversary: the media. In a news conference in Whippany, Mr. Christie took exception to a question from a reporter from The Star-Ledger of Newark regarding Mr. Samson. \u201cPeople like you are stupid enough to go and cover it,\u201d he snarled in response to a question about Mr. Samson. \u201cJust because you\u2019re dumb enough to cover it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to be just as stupid and answer a question about it.\u201d The moment was vintage Christie, but it did not ricochet around social media or splash across cable news shows. The remark dissipated into the silence of the room. The governor briefly looked down at the lectern, glanced to the back of the room, and took the next question."}
