Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Vice President Mike Pence, above at the North Korean border, gave the North a stern warning about American resolve but opened a diplomatic door. Before leaving Seoul for trade talks in Japan, he said Washington was seeking security \u201cthrough peaceable means, through negotiations.\u201d Still, the standoff invites miscalculation, our analysts say. Our \u201cDaily\u201d podcast examines the two ways the U.S. is dealing with North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat: sabotage and diplomacy. _____ \u2022 South Korea is bracing for its biggest criminal trial in decades. The ousted president, Park Geun-hye, faces 10 years to life in prison after being indicted on corruption charges. The sprawling scandal has now engulfed not only Samsung, but the retail conglomerate Lotte and the semiconductor firm SK. _____ \u2022 \u201cHe\u2019s not a dictator. He\u2019s a democrat.\u201d That\u2019s a description of Turkey\u2019s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by one of the slim majority of voters who approved a new political system that bestows sweeping powers on his office from 2019. Mr. Erdogan hailed the vote as a much-needed step in restoring stability, but critics, like the protesters above, fear he will use the victory as a mandate for even greater repression. _____ \u2022 Indonesia\u2019s political pluralism faces a stern test from hard-line Islamic sentiment in Jakarta\u2019s tense governor\u2019s race. Recent polls see a dead heat in Wednesday\u2019s runoff between the incumbent Christian governor known as Ahok, above left, against Anies Baswedan, far right, a former minister. _____ \u2022 Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network, is facing a backlash after a video of a man being fatally shot was viewed thousands of times before it was removed. The suspected killer, above, posted the video and is still at large. The episode took place in Ohio, but it highlights Facebook\u2019s quandary over what kind of role it plays in policing content on its global platform. _____ \u2022 Climate change rerouted a river in a geological instant. Melting water from one of Canada\u2019s largest glaciers used to flow north, to the Bering Sea. Last spring, it reversed course, in a case of what scientists call \u201criver piracy.\u201d \u2022 The 12,000-member Writers Guild of America begins voting to authorize a strike, which could bring Hollywood to a standstill on May 1. \u2022 Taizo Son, the younger brother of SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son, became the latest billionaire to move to Singapore. \u2022 Slack, the upstart messaging service now valued at $4 billion, now must fend off some of the tech industry\u2019s largest and fiercest competitors. \u2022 The International Monetary Fund releases its World Economic Outlook, and China issues its monthly house price index. \u2022 U.S. stocks were up. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 In Sri Lanka, the death toll in the collapse of a garbage dump reached 28 and was expected to increase as rescuers dug for a fourth day through debris. [The New York Times] \u2022 Abu Sayyaf, the Philippine militant group, beheaded a local fisherman hours after a deadly gunfight with government forces on the popular tourist island of Bohol. [The New York Times] \u2022 China\u2019s  anti-graft agency said that Li Shiqiao, one of its 100 most wanted suspects who had been on the run since 2009, had been \u201cpersuaded to return\u201d from Canada and surrender. [Reuters] \u2022 Hong Kong is calling for extra caution on the city\u2019s trails after five hiking-related deaths this year. [South China Morning Post] \u2022 The police in India\u2019s northern Jammu and Kashmir state told telecom companies to shut down mobile broadband services in the restive Kashmir Valley to block the circulation of inciting videos, like one showing a man tied to the front of an army jeep. [Kashmir Observer] \u2022 An invasion of the red claw crayfish, Australia\u2019s freshwater lobster, in several Malaysian rivers is devastating the livelihoods of local shrimp fishermen. [New Straits Times] \u2022 The Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur, one of India\u2019s most elite engineering schools, will begin teaching vastu shashtra, the 8,000-year-old Indian \u201cscience of architecture.\u201d [Quartz] \u2022 Prince Harry said he suffered for years after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, until he finally got help about three years ago, at the urging of his older brother, Prince William. [The New York Times] \u2022 The case for exercising: If the effects of exercise could be put in a pill and prescribed, it would be rightly hailed as an almost miraculous cure. \u2022 Confused about quinoa and nutrition? You\u2019re not alone. \u2022 Recipe of the day: If you can make a rag\u00fa, you can make this chicken curry. \u2022 \u201cMath is beautiful on a purely abstract level, quite apart from its ability to explain the world.\u201d So argues an Op-Ed writer, citing neuroscience studies that show that elegant equations activate the same part of the brain that music and art do. \u2022 A Y.M.C.A. in Paris  claims the oldest basketball court in the world, continuously functional since the building opened in 1893. But it is in no shape for regular basketball games. \u2022 And Banksy, the elusive British artist, opened a hotel in Bethlehem. Some see it as creative activism, others see \u201coppression tourism.\u201d When the U.S. sent a team of warships to the Korean Peninsula, we wondered about the namesake of the aircraft carrier leading the group \u2014 the Carl Vinson \u2014 and the broader question of how Navy ships are named. Carl Vinson was a long-serving Georgia congressman whose zeal for military expansion led him to be called the \u201cFather of the Two-Ocean Navy.\u201d Launched in 1980, the carrier was one of the first major Navy ships named after a living person since the 1800s. In 1862, Congress specified that ships, depending on their class, should be named after the states, rivers, or \u201cprincipal cities and towns.\u201d But naval expansion soon exhausted geographical names. There have been controversies over some namings. The Clinton administration took heat for naming a destroyer after a British citizen, Winston Churchill, and traditionalists objected to plans to name a ship after Harvey Milk, the slain gay rights activist. Mr. Vinson himself was a staunch segregationist. And sometimes the name just doesn\u2019t fit. Cesar Chavez, the civil rights activist, had a cargo ship posthumously named after him. A proponent of nonviolence, he once said his time in the Navy was \u201cthe two worst years of my life.\u201d _____ This briefing was prepared for the Australian morning.
