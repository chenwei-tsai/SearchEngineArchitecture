It is 2,000, not 1,000. \u2022 An article on Wednesday about Goldman Sachs\u2019s earnings misstated, in some copies, the position that R. Martin Chavez, Goldman\u2019s incoming chief financial officer, previously held with the company. He was chief information officer, not chief technology officer. \u2022 An article on Tuesday about a potential walkout by the Writers Guild of America misstated the year of a previous strike. It was 1988, not 1998. SPORTS Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Tuesday with an article about the Boston Marathon misspelled the surname of the winner of the men\u2019s race in some copies. As the article correctly noted, he is Geoffrey Kirui, not Kiriu. \u2022 Because of an editing error, an article on April 5 about N.H.L. players\u2019 reactions to a decision by the league that they could not participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics referred incorrectly in some copies to games being played in Sweden next season. They are regular-season games, not preseason games. THE ARTS A theater review on Wednesday about the Broadway production of Paula Vogel\u2019s \u201cIndecent\u201d misidentified the theater where the play was first staged, and the year in which it debuted. It was at the Yale Repertory Theater in 2015, not at the Vineyard Theater last year. The review also misidentified an actor who appeared in a 1920s production of Sholem Asch\u2019s play \u201cGod of Vengeance,\u201d an event that serves as source material for \u201cIndecent.\u201d The actor was Rudolph Schildkraut \u2014 not his son, Joseph Schildkraut.
