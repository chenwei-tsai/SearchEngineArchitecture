{"text": "Good morning on this drippy Thursday. A wet week we\u2019re having. Think of today as a drizzle sandwich: Your morning and evening commute could get sprinkled, but in between it will be mostly cloudy with a high near 70. As we struggled through several days of hair-gone-wrong and umbrellas turned inside out, we wondered whether there was any truth to that old saying, \u201cApril showers bring May flowers.\u201d So we asked one expert on weather, and another on flowers. Here\u2019s what we learned: The rainiest time of year in New York City is, indeed, late March through May, said John Homenuk, a meteorologist at New York Metro Weather. Here\u2019s the catch: Precipitation is heavier in April, he said, but there are more rainy days, on average, in May. This time of year, we\u2019re shifting from a drier, colder air mass in the winter to a warmer, more humid air mass in the summer, Mr. Homenuk explained. And as with anything, he said, \u201cWhen you go through a transition, you have to go through a rough patch.\u201d And the flowers? April showers are certainly good for flowers, but the aphorism leaves out two major factors that contribute to their blooming: temperatures and sun. \u201cThe days with the rain and the gray will feed the plants and get them ready to go,\u201d said Kristin Schleiter, associate vice president for outdoor gardens at the New York Botanical Garden. \u201cAnd then the sun will push them into extra growth and help the flowers open.\u201d And too many showers aren\u2019t good, either. \u201cIf it rains for a very long time, days in a row, the water sitting on top of the flowers can sometimes damage them,\u201d Mr. Schleiter said, \u201cso a little bit of sun and a little bit of breeze will help dry them out and bring them back to perfection.\u201d Here\u2019s what else is happening: \u2022 New York is bracing for President Trump\u2019s first return as president next week.

The new Kosciuszko Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and Queens, will open tonight. (Officials have coined the term K Bridge to avoid the mouthful that is \u201cKosciuszko.\u201d) Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo will host a ceremonial opening at noon today, and the bridge will open to motorists on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway at 11:30 p.m. The new K Bridge will span 1,001 feet across the Newtown Creek and will replace the original bridge, which is 78 years old. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement around the opening because the old bridge was really loathed and was always choked with traffic,\u201d said Emma. G. Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter for The New York Times. \u201cEventually, there will be two bridges and a lot more cars can pass through.\u201d For now, there will be six lanes on the bridge, three running in either direction. But, as Ms. Fitzsimmons noted, there are plans to expand these lanes with a second, parallel bridge to be completed by 2020. \u201cNow people get a new bridge,\u201d she added, \u201cand a pretty one at that.\u201d New York Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. till late morning.
