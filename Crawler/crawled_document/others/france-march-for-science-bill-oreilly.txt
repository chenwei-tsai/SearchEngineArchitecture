French voters will go to the polls on Sunday for the first round of their presidential election \u2014 a close fight that will shape the future of both France and the European Union. A terrorist attack on Thursday that left a police officer dead on the sidewalk of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es injected fresh uncertainty into an already unpredictable election. Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent centrist, have slight leads in a field of 11 candidates. Unless one candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will advance to a runoff next month. Here is our guide to how the contest works and what is at stake. _____ 2. President Trump said he would unveil a broad outline this week of his proposal for \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts. One major roadblock to any tax overhaul could come from a field the president knows well: real estate. Saturday will be Mr. Trump\u2019s 100th day in office, and he is racing to stack up accomplishments ahead of that milestone. Rewriting the nation\u2019s tax code will be an enormous political fight. One potential complication: Mr. Trump also hopes to revive the Republican health care plan that collapsed last month. _____ 3. Congress returns on Monday from a two-week recess, and immediately faces an urgent deadline: Much of the government will run out of money at midnight on Friday unless a spending bill is passed. President Trump is pushing for funding for a border wall and more money for the military. Democrats\u2019 priorities include cost-sharing payments to insurance companies to help defray the cost of covering low-income people under the Affordable Care Act. A deal or a stopgap measure is needed to avert a government shutdown. _____ 4. Thousands of scientists and their supporters gathered on Saturday in Washington for what they called the March for Science. One organizer, a pediatrician who helped expose lead poisoning in Flint, Mich., called the protest the start of a movement to press governments not to dismiss or deny science. For many participants, climate change is a particular concern. Demonstrators in hundreds of cities joined in the protest. Our photographers captured scenes around the globe. _____ 5. Cassini, a NASA spacecraft that has been circling Saturn for 13 years, is headed toward its end in a blaze of scientific glory. On Saturday, it began its descent into the gap between Saturn and its innermost ring, where no human artifact has ever gone. It will weave in and out of that space until mid-September, when it will crash into the planet and be incinerated. Cassini\u2019s rich legacy includes the discovery of Enceladus, an \u201cocean world\u201d that many astronomers think is the most likely place to find evidence of life beyond Earth. _____ 6. Arkansas began a planned series of executions that it is rushing to complete before its supply of a drug called midazolam expires at the end of the month. The state carried out its first execution in 12 years, killing Ledell Lee, who was condemned for murder. Three more executions are scheduled; others have been halted by court rulings. Midazolam, a sedative, has become a flash point in the death penalty debate. Most executions using it have gone as planned, but a handful were criticized as botched, leading activists \u2014 and some judges \u2014 to call the drug\u2019s use inhumane. _____ 7. Fox News parted ways last week with its biggest star, Bill O\u2019Reilly. Mr. O\u2019Reilly was forced out after an internal investigation into a series of sexual harassment allegations against him, which he has denied. As protests mounted and advertisers abandoned Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, the company decided to cut ties. The move reflected the growing prominence inside 21st Century Fox of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sons, James and Lachlan, who are guiding a generational change at one of the world\u2019s most powerful media conglomerates. _____ 8. James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, made decisions that shaped the contours of the nation\u2019s presidential election. Four of our reporters delved into why and how he made those choices. Partisanship did not seem to be a factor, but in trying to pick the least damaging among undesirable options, Mr. Comey handled investigations involving Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump in starkly different ways. He spoke publicly about the bureau\u2019s scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server, but stayed silent about an inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s possible campaign ties to Russia. \u201cThis was unique in the history of the F.B.I.,\u201d a former national security official said. \u201cPeople say, \u2018This has never been done before.\u2019 Well, there never was a before.\u201d _____ 9. Enough yachting and kitesurfing: Barack Obama will make his first post-presidential public appearance on Monday. Mr. Obama will return to his adopted hometown, Chicago, to discuss civic engagement with university students. After that, he plans to embark on a series of public remarks and private paid speeches across the country and in Europe. Activists would love for Mr. Obama to speak out about his successor, but those close to him say Mr. Obama has no interest in public feuding. Translation: Don\u2019t expect any tweetstorms from @BarackObama. _____ 10. Sunday is Shakespeare\u2019s birthday. If you\u2019d like to celebrate with some thematic reading, we recommend two new books about his work, including the story of a \u201cHamlet\u201d troupe that performed in nearly every country in the world. Above are actors portraying Hamlet and Laertes in Amman, Jordan. Our editors also have suggestions on the snacks, songs, streaming and cultural excursions that we\u2019re excited about. _____ 11. Emma Morano, the world\u2019s oldest person, died this month at age 117, leaving behind tips on longevity \u2014 she credited her diet of raw eggs and lack of a husband \u2014 and a tiny collection of cherished personal items. A scattering of rosaries. A photograph of her only child. Handmade slippers. Our photographer cataloged the objects she left behind and the stories they told. Here\u2019s another tale of aging well: Kathrine Switzer ran her first Boston Marathon in 1967, entering the then all-male race as \u201cK.V. Switzer\u201d to hide her gender. Last week, at age 70, she ran the race again. She finished just 25 minutes slower. Thanks for reading, and have a great week. _____ Your Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.
