{"text": "Every year since 2010 we have invited teenagers around the world to add The New York Times to their summer reading lists, and, so far, over 25,000 have. As a new presidential administration finds its footing here in the United States \u2014 and as fighting spills across borders and international institutions abroad \u2014 teachers and students alike may feel that keeping up with the news is more important than ever. We hope our 10-week contest can make that easy. But we also hope students will realize that reading The Times is fun. As you\u2019ll see in the guidelines below, literally anything published on NYTimes.com in 2017 is fair game. We don\u2019t care if you choose a piece about North Korea or naked mole rats, far-right politics, food, fashion or flying cars; we just care what you have to say about why you chose it. Interested? Post any questions you might have in the comments and we\u2019ll answer you there, and join our May 10 webinar on summer and independent reading to learn more. __________ Here\u2019s how it works: The contest runs from June 16 to Aug. 25. Every Friday beginning June 16, we will publish a Student Opinion question asking the same two questions: What interested you most in The Times this week? Why? Anyone 13 to 19 years old from anywhere in the world can post an answer any week until Friday, Aug. 25, and contestants can choose from any Times article, essay, video, interactive or photograph published in 2017, on any topic they like. Every Tuesday starting July 4 we will announce winners from a previous week and publish their writing. To get an idea of the breadth of topics students have chosen in the past \u2014 from refugees and \"post-truth politics\u201d to power napping and junk food \u2014 you can read the work of all our previous winners here. Scroll down to find more details and tips, the most important of which are also on this handy PDF. And on May 10 we invite you to join us for a special webinar about this contest, as well as about how to build your students\u2019 independent news-reading habits in general. More questions? Here are some that have been frequently asked over the years, but please post anything else you\u2019d like to know in the comments, and we\u2019ll answer you there. Q. What kinds of responses are you looking for? A. We don\u2019t care what you choose or whether you loved or hated it; what we care about is what you have to say about why you picked it. If you don\u2019t believe us, scroll through seven years worth of winners. They have written on weighty topics like gender, race and identity, space exploration and 21st-century concentration camps, but they have also written on Disney shows, bagels, running and Jon Stewart withdrawal. Whatever the subject, you\u2019ll see that the best pieces year after year make both personal connections to the news and go beyond the personal to discuss the broader questions and ideas that the topic raises. So whether you were moved by an article, enlightened by an essay, bowled over by a photo, irked by an editorial or inspired by a feature, find something in The Times that genuinely interests you and tell us why, as honestly and originally as you can. Q. What are the rules? A. First, here is a PDF of the key rules and details in this post. Please share. \u2014 We will post the same Student Opinion question every Friday, starting June 16. Each will ask, \u201cWhat interested you most in The Times this week? Why?\u201d That is where you should post your picks (and reasons) any time until the next Friday. Then we will close that post to comments and open a new one with the same question. That means that students can write in on any day until Friday, Aug. 25, at 7 a.m. Eastern when the contest ends. As soon as the contest starts, we will keep an up-to-date link to that week\u2019s question at the top of this page. \u2014 You can choose from anything published in the print paper or on NYTimes.com in 2017, including videos, graphics, slide shows and podcasts. \u2014 Feel free to participate every week, but we allow only one submission per person per week. \u2014 The contest is open to teenagers only \u2014 anyone from 13 to 19 years old \u2014 from anywhere in the world. \u2014 Our commenting system allows responses up to 1,500 characters, which is somewhere between 250 and 300 words. \u2014 Make sure to provide us with the full URL or headline (for example, \u201cIndependence Days: My Perfect Imperfect Gap Year\u201d or https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/education/edlife/my-perfect-imperfect-gap-year.html). Q. Who will be judging my work? A. The Learning Network staff, plus a team of as-yet-to-be-named New York Times journalists. Q. When should I check to see whether my submission won? A. Every Tuesday from July 4 to Sept. 5, we will publish a previous week\u2019s winner or winners in a separate article you can find here. We will also celebrate the winners on Twitter and Facebook. Q. How do I participate in this contest if I don\u2019t have a digital subscription? A. NYTimes.com has a digital subscription system in which readers have free access to 10 articles each month. If you exceed that limit, you will be asked to become a digital subscriber. One thing you should know, however, is that The Learning Network and all its posts for students, as well as all Times articles linked from them, are accessible without a digital subscription. That means that if you use any of the articles we have linked to on our site for summer reading, they will not count as part of the 10-article limit. And remember: You can use anything published in 2017. Q. How do I prove to my teacher that I participated? A. When you comment, make sure to check the box that asks if you would like to be emailed when your comment is published. If you do so, the system will send you a link to your comment, which you can use to show your teacher, your parents, your friends or anyone else you\u2019d like to impress. Please note that you will not get an email until the comment has been approved, which may take up to 48 hours over weekends. Q. How can teachers, librarians and parents use this challenge? A. Through the years, adults have told us over and over that participating in this contest has made their students both more aware of and more interested in what\u2019s going on in the world. If that\u2019s not enough of a reason to assign it, our contest is also an easy way to add more nonfiction to your students\u2019 reading lists \u2014 and to encourage teenagers to make their own choices about what to read, as anything published in The Times in 2017 is fair game. Thank you for making this contest a hit year after year, and please spread the word that it\u2019s back for an eighth season. Good luck. Please post any questions in the comments, and we\u2019ll answer you there. We will also add the link to the top of this post on June 16, when the contest begins. And if you join our May 10 webinar, we\u2019ll give you many more tips, including ideas for practicing in class before you send students away to do it on their own during summer break.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/learning/the-eighth-annual-new-york-times-summer-reading-contest.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "The Learning Network", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T08:20:21-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T08:17:27-04:00", "abstract": "Our June 16-Aug. 25 contest will be judged by Times journalists, and winners will be published on The Learning Network each week.
