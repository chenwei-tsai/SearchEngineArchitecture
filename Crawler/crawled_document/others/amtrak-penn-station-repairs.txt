{"text": "Amtrak officials confirmed on Thursday that they are planning to close several tracks at Pennsylvania Station in New York this summer for major repairs, but the railroad\u2019s chief executive refused to say how many tracks would be closed or for how long. The decision to close tracks during busy weekdays will disrupt the lives of thousands of commuters who rely on the station. But during an announcement about the railroad\u2019s repair plans, Amtrak\u2019s chief executive, Charles W. Moorman, repeatedly declined to say how many tracks would be closed or how disruptive the work would be for commuters. Mr. Moorman said Amtrak first had to speak with the other railroads that share the station before disclosing details about the track closings. Penn Station, the nation\u2019s busiest train station, handles 600,000 passengers and 1,300 trains each day. Closing several of the station\u2019s 21 tracks is expected to impact service on the three railroads that use the station: Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road. Two recent train derailments led to painful delays across the region and brought attention to the station\u2019s deteriorating infrastructure. Amtrak officials determined the tracks were so brittle that they needed urgent repairs. But the decision to schedule the work during the workweek was a departure from Amtrak\u2019s traditional strategy of trying to minimize disruptions by limiting repairs to nights and weekends. On Thursday morning, the trains delays at Penn Station continued. Amtrak said passengers should expect delays of up to 30 minutes because of track maintenance at the station.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/amtrak-penn-station-repairs.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T10:21:40-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T10:21:09-04:00", "abstract": "The tracks will be closed during the workweek this summer, but the railroad\u2019s chief executive refused to say how many tracks would be closed or for how long.", "title": "Amtrak Plans to Close Several Penn Station Tracks for Major Repairs"}
