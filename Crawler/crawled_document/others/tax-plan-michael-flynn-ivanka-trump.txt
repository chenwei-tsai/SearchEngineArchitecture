Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Tax plan puts business first. President Trump plans to unveil a tax blueprint today that would apply a vastly reduced, 15 percent rate to a wide array of businesses, including his own. But it may omit a contentious border tax on imports. Markets rose on the news, but our economics reporters caution that it is too soon to say if the administration can deliver on its promises. Part of the inspiration for the president\u2019s plan was a sketch on a white cloth napkin in 1974. \u2022 How was your Tuesday? It was a busy one for the administration: \u2022 President Trump dropped his demand for immediate funds for a border wall, easing the passage of a spending bill by Friday to avert a government shutdown. \u2022 Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, may have violated the law by not disclosing his business dealings with Russia, top lawmakers from both parties said. \u2022 A federal judge blocked the administration\u2019s efforts to cut funds for \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d \u2022 And the president made an unequivocal statement of support for Israel at an annual Holocaust remembrance ceremony and promised to \u201cconfront anti-Semitism.\u201d \u2022 Witnessing a brutal battle against ISIS. Michael Gordon, a military correspondent for The Times, is on the front lines in Iraq, where the fight to retake western Mosul from the Islamic State continues. He guides us through a city where the plight of thousands of civilians appears to be worsening by the day. \u2022 Worries beyond water. If anxieties over tainted water in Flint, Mich., have eased, other problems remain. Our reporter visited one block in the city and found people struggling with entrenched poverty and violence. \u201cI feel like Flint is falling,\u201d one resident said. \u201cIt just keeps on falling.\u201d \u2022 Penn Station nightmare. After two derailments, Amtrak is considering closing tracks at the station in Manhattan for an extended period to make repairs. \u2022 \u201cThe Daily,\u201d your audio news report. Twenty minutes a day, five days a week, hosted by Michael Barbaro and powered by New York Times journalism. Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. \u2022 More trouble at Fox News: Eleven current and former employees have filed a class-action lawsuit against the network alleging racial discrimination and expanding on a complaint filed in March. A Fox News spokeswoman denied the allegations, which came less than a week after the ouster of the network\u2019s star host Bill O\u2019Reilly. \u2022 Nearly half of the largest U.S. corporations have set their own targets for emissions reductions, even as the Trump administration retreats from environmental commitments. In the U.S., there are more than two jobs in the solar industry for each job in coal. \u2022 Despite the turmoil that has engulfed Wells Fargo in the past year, shareholders voted, tepidly, to keep all of the bank\u2019s 15 directors. \u2022 A debt crisis in one Chinese town has raised fears of wider problems in China. \u2022 The Nasdaq passed 6,000 for the first time on Tuesday, and other U.S. indexes were also up. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 One of the keys to success at work is taking time off. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Eggs, chorizo and asparagus are a good option for any time of day. \u2022 \u201cWhat happened in this place is beyond our imagination.\u201d In today\u2019s 360 video, we visit Auschwitz, where a major construction project is underway to preserve the memory of the Holocaust. \u2022 Embrace your failures. That\u2019s the ethos of a museum that will open in Sweden in June. In a collection that offers insight into the \u201crisky business of innovation,\u201d the Museum of Failure will showcase products that flopped, such as Harley-Davidson fragrance, Bic pens for women, and Coca-Cola Blak, a coffee-inspired drink. \u2022 The spirit of Selena. Fans of Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez, the Tejano singer who was murdered in 1995 at 23, have never stopped celebrating her life. A photographer captured portraits of her fans at a gathering in Los Angeles. \u2022 Familiar fare in a new setting. Our restaurant critic reviews Union Square Cafe, which tries to replicate the original mainstay at a new location in Gramercy Park. \u2022 Best of late-night TV. The hosts had a lot to say after Ivanka Trump defended her father\u2019s treatment of women and called him a \u201ctremendous champion\u201d of families. Last weekend, protesters in the U.S. marched in defense of scientific inquiry, spurred by a president who casts doubt on climate change. They might have been pleased by today\u2019s tale, of a government that turned to a citizen-scientist for answers. On this day in 1803, a shower of 2,000 to 3,000 meteorites fell on L\u2019Aigle, France. The French Academy of Sciences sent Jean-Baptiste Biot, a physicist, to assess the origin of the debris. Mr. Biot concluded that the meteorites didn\u2019t resemble anything on Earth and, considering accounts of \u201ca rain of stones thrown by the meteor,\u201d had to be from outer space. He thus established the field of study called meteoritics. (Meteorology, the study of the atmosphere and its phenomena, was already claimed.) Four years later, a meteor and its debris were seen in Connecticut, and two Yale scientists concluded they had come from space. President Thomas Jefferson greeted their findings with caution, however. (A remark widely attributed to him on the matter is most likely apocryphal: that it was \u201ceasier to believe that two Yankee professors could lie than to admit that stones could fall from heaven.\u201d) It wasn\u2019t until later in the 19th century that meteorites\u2019 extraterrestrial origins became widely accepted as scientific fact.
