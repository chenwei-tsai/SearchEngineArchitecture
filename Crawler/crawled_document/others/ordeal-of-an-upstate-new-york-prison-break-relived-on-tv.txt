{"text": "DANNEMORA, N.Y. \u2014 Imagine the elevator pitch: A fortress of a prison in a tiny village besieged by unforgiving wilderness. Two convicted murderers longing for a life outside its walls \u2014 plotting an elaborate escape, enlisting prison workers to sneak in tools, sometimes hidden in meat, and painstakingly carving their way out. Then, one day, they pull it off, emerging from a manhole cover nearby. They leave behind a message written on a sticky note: \u201cHave a nice day!\u201d The escape from the Clinton Correctional Facility almost two years ago touched off a 23-day manhunt that rattled and riveted this region of upstate New York where many said they had grown accustomed to living in the shadow of a maximum-security prison. As investigators fanned out in a vast search and residents started taking the unusual step of locking their doors, conversations often drifted from expressing surprise over an exit that would have once seemed impossible to speculation over how far the inmates had gotten and how the episode would inevitably catch the attention of filmmakers and television producers. \u201cIt was just a given,\u201d said Patricia Light, who grew up in Dannemora and whose home is just a short walk downhill from the prison. \u201cIt was quite an ordeal for us, and it was scary because we had no idea where they were.\u201d Sure enough, idle chatter over the Hollywood treatment has turned into something real. It is not necessarily the big-budget blockbuster that some might have envisioned, but a made-for-TV movie, to be broadcast on Sunday on the Lifetime network. It seems likely to draw an audience of residents here eager to watch \u2014 some quite skeptically \u2014 a production based on their community\u2019s true story. The movie, \u201cNew York Prison Break: The Seduction of Joyce Mitchell,\u201d centers on Ms. Mitchell, who worked in the prison tailor shop. Officials said she smuggled in hacksaw blades, chisels and other tools to help the prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, forge a way out. But she failed to show up as planned with a getaway car, forcing the men to scuttle plans to flee far from the area and instead head into the region\u2019s thick woods. Mr. Matt was fatally shot by a United States Border Patrol agent after he refused to drop a shotgun, and two days later, Mr. Sweat was shot and captured near the Canadian border. Ms. Mitchell, who pleaded guilty to aiding in the escape, was sentenced to up to seven years in prison, describing her actions as \u201cby far the worst mistake I have made in my life.\u201d In the movie, Ms. Mitchell, portrayed by the actress Penelope Ann Miller, is cast as an easy mark for the men, charmed by their romantic advances. The men talk of running to Mexico, and Ms. Mitchell, who is frustrated by her marriage and listens to recordings of romance novels while doing chores, pictures herself joining them, even losing weight to fit into a bikini. But a panic attack sends her to the hospital when she is supposed to rendezvous with the men. In one scene, an investigator recounts the (actual) crimes that led to the men\u2019s incarceration. Mr. Sweat was serving life without parole for killing a sheriff\u2019s deputy, shooting him before running him over with his car while he was still alive. Mr. Matt was serving 25 years to life for torturing and killing his former boss. \u201cAnd you gave them the means to escape from prison into the population?\u201d the investigator said. \u201cEverybody says I\u2019m too nice,\u201d Ms. Mitchell\u2019s character replied. \u201cPrison Break\u201d is the latest production by a writer-director and producers who have translated other \u201ctrue crimes\u201d popular with tabloid readers into television movies, including ones involving the case of three young women held captive for over a decade in Cleveland and the so-called Craigslist killer, a man accused of murdering a woman he met online. Even as the manhunt was underway in 2015, the escape in Dannemora had caught their attention as a potential next project. \u201cWe knew right away,\u201d said Judith Verno, an executive producer. She said they had been gripped by the story of an apparently ordinary woman who had become manipulated into colluding with killers. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s compelling to us,\u201d Ms. Verno said. \u201cHow do you find that moment that is both relatable and goes in a direction that\u2019s extraordinary?\u201d The movie\u2019s script was the product of meticulous research, she said, including Freedom of Information Law requests for documents, reviewing news accounts and getting assistance from a local consultant. Much of the dialogue, she added, had come from the characters\u2019 own words. The line about being \u201ctoo nice\u201d? That came from an interview Ms. Mitchell conducted with NBC. \u201cThe stories as they play out in real life do not need any dramatic augmentation,\u201d Ms. Verno said. \u201cTruth is better than fiction, and we are strong believers in that.\u201d Around Dannemora, plenty will be watching closely. \u201cThat time put us on the map, for good or bad,\u201d said Simon Conroy, a Clinton County legislator and an organizer of the Lake Champlain International Film Festival, \u201cand most people are interested to see that it\u2019s been picked up as a story and they want to see how the story is told.\u201d The episode brought about changes inside the prison, but its legacy has manifested itself in other strange ways. It inspired Halloween costumes, and the \u201cHave a Nice Day!\u201d note (along with an off-color sketch) has been printed on T-shirts. And when Tina Leduc moved her salon to a new location last year, she said it led her to the perfect name: Escape to a New You. She described her shop as a social network come to life, where all the talk of the town filters through. And on a recent morning, with a client in the chair and Otis, her Shih Tzu, sprawled on the floor, she could confirm that the coming movie was one such topic of conversation. They would be watching, even if just out of curiosity. \u201cI want to know how it doesn\u2019t tell the truth,\u201d said Brenda Bingel, who retired after three decades as a civilian employee in the prison and who will be among the more skeptical viewers. The high walls of the prison loom over Dannemora, a bulwark that consumes one side of the main street in this community of fewer than 5,000 unincarcerated residents in the northeastern corner of the state. It is one of the first things visitors notice, and they often voice concern over the proximity to criminals. \u201cWe would laugh at them,\u201d Ms. Leduc said. \u201cWe have nothing to worry about. They\u2019re not going to stay here,\u2019\u2019 she added, referring to the prisoners. \u201cThey\u2019re going to leave.\u201d But the escape changed all of that, upending life for weeks. Helicopters hovered overhead, shaking the walls of houses. State Police officers searched backyards. These days, locking doors has become a habit. Ms. Leduc said she started carrying bear mace. \u201cThe sting is off, but you\u2019re never not looking behind you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt changed us.\u201d She was doubtful that the movie could capture all of that \u2014 the fear, the concern over the loved ones, like her son, a corrections officer, working long hours in tough conditions during the search. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear about the broken legs. You don\u2019t hear about the tick bites,\u201d Ms. Leduc said. \u201cYou hear about one woman.\u201d She, for one, said she would not be watching. Living through the ordeal was enough, she said. She also figures that as soon as she opens her shop next week, she will hear all about it.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/nyregion/ordeal-of-an-upstate-new-york-prison-break-relived-on-tv.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T12:04:23-04:00", "abstract": "A movie to be broadcast on the Lifetime network is likely to draw an audience in Dannemora, N.Y.
