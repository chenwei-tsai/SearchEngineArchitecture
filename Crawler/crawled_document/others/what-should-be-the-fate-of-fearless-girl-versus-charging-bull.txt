What is your reaction to the interpretations of the two sculptures expressed by the people interviewed in the video? In the Opinion column \u201c\u2018Fearless Girl\u2019 Doesn\u2019t Need Any Bull,\u201d Gail Collins writes: Students: Read the entire column, then tell us: \u2014 What are the opposing viewpoints expressed in the essay? What are your reactions to them? \u2014 What meaning, if any, do you find in each sculpture? \u2014 Would \u201cFearless Girl\u201d have the same meaning if it were not positioned facing \u201cCharging Bull\u201d? Explain. \u2014 Does knowing that Arturo Di Modica spent his own money in the creation of \u201cCharging Bull\u201d change how you interpret the current situation? What about the way he deposited the sculpture in the night, or the then-mayor\u2019s decision to move \u201cCharging Bull\u201d to its current home? \u2014 What do you think should happen next, in fairness to the public, each sculptor and all other involved parties? \u2014 Are there other pieces of public art that you can you imagine being positioned in conversation or opposition with one another? Explain. Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public."}
