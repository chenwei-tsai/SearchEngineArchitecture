Join the Club", "material_type_facet": "News", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "During Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, a curious feature of the lobby in Trump Tower in Manhattan became a sideline distraction: Kiosks selling merchandise occupied the open public space where seating should have been. After $14,000 in fines and at least a year of back-and-forths, the benches were reinstalled. But the building continues to violate the terms of its decades-old agreement, according to a new audit completed by the office of the New York City comptroller, Scott M. Stringer. Auditors found that it lacked many of the tables it is required to provide the public, part of an agreement that had allowed Mr. Trump to build his tower 20 stories higher than originally allowed. The building was one of more than 180 properties where public spaces did not comply with the city\u2019s rules \u2014 more than half of all locations with privately owned public spaces in New York, according to the audit. Privately owned public spaces, commonly known as POPS, are areas that developers have agreed to provide the public in exchange for leniency on certain zoning requirements. They have been a quirk of the New York landscape since the 1960s, when they were pioneered before spreading to other cities around the world. And they are plentiful in Manhattan \u2014 Zuccotti Park, of Occupy Wall Street fame, is one \u2014 where they have been a popular mechanism for developers to build taller, more valuable buildings in areas with limited space. It is no secret that landlords often do not maintain the public spaces as initially designed. But the audit released by the comptroller\u2019s office illustrates just how widespread these violations are. Auditors found restaurant tables at public spaces at 825 Third Avenue, 200 East 64th Street and 2 Gold Street. They also discovered signs that incorrectly informed people that the public spaces were for \u201cmembers only,\u201d at 175 East 96th Street, or \u201cprivate property,\u201d at 101 Barclay Street. And one privately owned public space, part of a lot at 410 East 58th Street, was eliminated when a building was constructed over it. \u201cRight now, some large developers are gaining benefits worth tens of millions of dollars, but it\u2019s coming at the expense of the rest of us,\u201d Mr. Stringer said in a statement. The report reserved some of its harshest words for the city\u2019s Buildings Department, which regulates the plazas along with the City Planning Department. \u201cThere are many good actors who are meeting their requirements,\u201d he said. \u201cBut where agreements are being violated, the Department of Buildings is refusing to do enforcement.\u201d A vast majority of the locations \u2014 275 out of 333 \u2014 had not been inspected in four years, the report said. And when those inspections did take place, they were often \u201clate, incomplete or ineffective.\u201d Forty-one of 58 locations inspected in the past four years were noncompliant, while only 10 were issued violations by the Buildings Department. At least one other building in the Trump Organization portfolio, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Columbus Circle, was among those in violation of a previous agreement, the auditors found. The building lacks a food kiosk with public seating that it had agreed to provide, the comptroller\u2019s office said. Representatives for the Trump Organization did not return a request for comment. The Buildings Department said it had improved its response time for complaints about the spaces in recent years. \u201cAs we continue to drive down these response times, we are making long-overdue improvements to hold accountable property owners who ignore the rules and fail to honor their agreements,\u201d an agency spokesman, Joseph Soldevere, said in a statement. \u201cWe are determined to keep these spaces open to the public.\u201d The City Planning Department said it would continue to work to \u201censure that these spaces provide their required and valuable amenities.\u201d Jerold S. Kayden, a professor of urban planning at Harvard and the author of \u201cPrivately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience,\u201d said POPS enforcement was a longstanding problem. In 2000, he took part in a citywide study of the spaces along with the City Planning Department that found similar percentages of noncompliance. Still, he said he hoped the new audit could effect change. \u201cAnything that places a spotlight on the underperformance of privately owned public space can help secure legal compliance,\u201d Professor Kayden said. He pointed to a handful of proposed City Council bills that would enhance signs at POPS, stiffen penalties and require the city to do more enforcement. The report also called for changes in the way the city polices the plazas. It recommended that the Buildings Department, which currently investigates only when prompted by complaints, investigate the plazas proactively, in addition to maintaining a more streamlined database of them. And it recommended that the City Planning Department better inform the public about the plazas through an advertising campaign and better signs around the plazas.", "item_type": "Article"}
