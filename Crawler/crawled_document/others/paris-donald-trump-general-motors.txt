Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 White House seeks a health care win. Eager to demonstrate progress on President Trump\u2019s promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the administration is pushing to resurrect a Republican bill before his 100th day in office, which falls at the end of next week. But Congress has a more urgent priority: a potential government shutdown. Lawmakers return from a two-week recess on Monday, with just a few days to prevent the federal government from running out of money. Health care may have to wait. \u2022 France on edge before election. A deadly attack on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris on Thursday could tip voting in the first round of a presidential election this weekend. Candidates who are perceived as tougher on crime and terrorism, especially the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, could benefit from the shooting, which killed a police officer and wounded three other people. The Islamic State claimed responsibility. Need to get up to speed before Sunday\u2019s vote? One of our reporters in Paris explains what\u2019s at stake, and we selected seven of our best reads on the French election. \u2022 Execution in Arkansas. Dismissing criticism that it was trying to rush prisoners to their deaths, the state carried out its first execution in more than a decade on Thursday night. Arkansas plans three more by the end of the month. The difficulties it has faced illustrate the troubled state of the death penalty, our Supreme Court reporter writes. \u2022 Consumer revolt led to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ouster. For advertisers who fled Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, lost revenue was one consideration, but the risk of a tarnished reputation was another.

Women aren\u2019t so sure, our senior correspondent on gender writes. \u2022 Egypt releases American. The Trump administration secured the freedom of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American aid worker, on Thursday night. She had been held for three years on charges of child abuse and human trafficking and had become an international symbol of authoritarianism in Egypt. \u2022 \u201cThe Daily,\u201d your audio news report. On today\u2019s show, a Times reporter based in Paris discusses Thursday\u2019s attack and the upcoming presidential election. Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. \u2022 Regarding trade, the White House has ordered an investigation of steel imports and took a jab at Canada for protecting its dairy farmers. One of President Trump\u2019s major targets is China\u2019s vast steel industry, but our Shanghai bureau chief says it may be difficult to contain. \u2022 General Motors is the latest company to pull out of Venezuela, where violent protests, crime, shortages and government asset seizures are constant threats. \u2022 Child care enriches more than children. Government spending on high-quality day care in the early years delivers an economic boon that lasts three generations, research finds. \u2022 U.S. stocks were up on Thursday. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Cutting out  added sweeteners for 30 days can permanently and pleasantly improve eating habits. \u2022 Which is better: high-intensity exercise or moderate endurance exercise?

Read about how the other side thinks: A debate on the right about economic protectionism; why the left should stop watching \u201cThe West Wing\u201d; and how late-night TV has intensified partisanship. \u2022 Berkeley reinvites Coulter. The University of California, Berkeley, said on Thursday that the conservative author Ann Coulter could speak on campus next month, a day after it had canceled an appearance, citing security threats. She vowed to speak next week, as originally scheduled. \u2022 Ready for the weekend. Bette Midler is back on Broadway, providing a dazzling lesson in star power in a revival of \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d, our theater critic writes. We also review \u201cThe Little Foxes,\u201d starring Laura Linney and Cynthia Nixon. Our film critics discuss some of this week\u2019s releases, including \u201cUnforgettable\u201d and \u201cThe Promise,\u201d in a video review. And in their weekly roundup, our book critics recommend 10 new titles. \u2022 Scientists on the march. On Saturday, demonstrators in more than 500 cities will march in support of scientific research, which they feel is under attack. But what they do after that is just as important. \u2022 Voyages of the heart. In our Travel section\u2019s Love issue, four authors recall times when love and travel intersected. In his adopted state of California, it is decreed by law: \u201cThe governor annually shall proclaim April 21 to be \u2018John Muir Day.\u2019 \u201d Born in Scotland on this day in 1838, Mr. Muir is perhaps best known for his writing as a naturalist and for founding the Sierra Club, the largest environmental organization in the United States. His efforts helped preserve wildernesses including Yosemite National Park and the Grand Canyon. In 1901, Mr. Muir published \u201cOur National Parks,\u201d a collection of essays that described areas of the American West and called for their preservation. It gained the attention of Theodore Roosevelt, who visited Mr. Muir in Yosemite for a three-night camping trip in 1903, during which they laid the groundwork for the president\u2019s conservation programs. The National Park Service was created in 1916, two years after Mr. Muir\u2019s death. Named the Greatest Californian in 1976 by the California Historical Society, Mr. Muir is also the namesake of more places in the state than any other person. The entry fee at Muir Woods National Monument, the redwood forest north of San Francisco, is waived this weekend for National Park Week.
