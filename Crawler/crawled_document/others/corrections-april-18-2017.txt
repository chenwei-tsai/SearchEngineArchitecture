{"source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-17T23:41:23-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Correction", "text": "FRONT PAGE A picture caption on Friday with the continuation of an article about the battle over public lands in the West misstated Monument Valley\u2019s relationship to the Bears Ears National Monument. While Monument Valley is near Bears Ears, it is not part of the national monument. \u2022 An obituary on Saturday about the computer scientist Robert W. Taylor misidentified the institution from which he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. It is the University of Texas at Austin (where he also did graduate work), not Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u2022 An article on Friday about Immigration and Customs Enforcement requirements for jails that will house detained immigrants misstated the frequency with which bedsheets must be changed. It is once a week, not once a day. The article also referred incorrectly to a requirement for the thickness of trash bags. Only bags used for blood and bodily fluid cleanup must be 1.5 millimeters thick; that requirement does not include all trash bags. THE ARTS An article on Saturday about the artist Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle misstated the closing date of her current exhibition, \u201cThe Evanesced,\u201d at the California African American Museum in Los Angeles. The show runs through June 25, not June 2. WEEKEND Because of an editing error, a picture on Friday with a film review of \u201cLittle Boxes\u201d carried an erroneous caption in some editions. The caption named three actors \u2014 Nelsan Ellis, Melanie Lynskey and Armani Jackson, but Mr. Jackson was not shown. A picture showing all three of the actors can be found at nytimes.com/movies. \u2022 An article on Friday about the new Museum of the American Revolution, which opens in Philadelphia on Wednesday, misstated the name of the historic Philadelphia building that is a few blocks away. It is Independence Hall, not Constitution Hall. OPINION An opinion article on April 12, about Robert Kennedy\u2019s 1967 trip to Mississippi, misstated the year that he worked on the Bedford-Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation. It was 1966, not 1964. The Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.
