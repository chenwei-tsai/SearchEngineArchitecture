{"text": "In the stench and smolder that followed the Sept. 11 attacks, emergency workers ripped the pews out of the little Roman Catholic chapel opposite the World Trade Center site in Battery Park City in Manhattan and used the church as a command station. As the weeks passed, the pastor erected a tent outside to celebrate Mass. The interior was used by the workers at ground zero as a place for food, rest and counseling. When residents of Battery Park City began returning home three months later, they were determined to restore the chapel, St. Joseph\u2019s. So the parish held a national fund-raising drive. It commissioned sacred artworks for the space to amplify the theme of rebirth from death. The chapel was rebuilt as both a prayer space and a Catholic memorial to the horrors and heroism of Sept. 11, 2001. In 2005, Cardinal Edward M. Egan officiated at the rededication. In a spot that for so long had felt like a war zone, it was a sign that life again bloomed. Now the little chapel itself is on the verge of destruction. As a result of the neighborhood\u2019s recovery, which the chapel helped bring about, St. Joseph\u2019s rent more than tripled in 2014 to $264,000 a year. Since then, the parish has been borrowing money from the Archdiocese of New York to cover the cost, but the parish\u2019s new pastor and its Finance Council have decided that the debt is not sustainable. The archdiocese is in negotiations to reduce the rent with LeFrak, the family real estate behemoth, which along with the Fisher and Olnick families is the landlord of Gateway, the residential development where the chapel is. According to parishioners, there has been an offer to reduce the rent from $80 to $70 per square foot, or about $230,000 a year, but that, they say, is still too much for the parish. Parishioners say their pastor, the Rev. Jarlath Quinn, has informed them that the chapel will close by June unless a miracle occurs. They are expecting to hear from the landlord this week about possible further rent reductions. The fight to save the chapel is led by a small, mostly female group of Battery Park City parishioners, most of whom lived through the attacks and cherish the chapel as a living link to Sept. 11. The group has been trying to raise a public outcry about the closing and promote fund-raising. What is confusing matters, they say, is that their own pastor has been steadily reducing the chapel\u2019s role in the parish rather than embracing their efforts. To save money, St. Joseph\u2019s Chapel is closed on weekday mornings and and on Saturdays, when tourists often want to visit. Its longstanding, thriving religious instruction program for children has been moved a half-mile away to the main church in the parish, St. Peter\u2019s, just north of the World Trade Center site. St. Joseph\u2019s is the only house of worship in Battery Park City, a park-filled, state-run enclave of roughly 13,000 residents just west of the World Trade Center site. Once a largely middle-class neighborhood, it is now a place of luxury apartments and high-end shopping malls. \u201cThe world ended, and everyone said, \u2018Never forget,\u2019\u201d said Amy McCarthy Koethe, 52, a parishioner whose memories of the attacks are so vivid that she still cries when she recounts them. \u201cWe are essentially making people forget, because we have basically sanitized Battery Park City of every single reminder of the attacks.\u201d She added, \u201cWe are fighting to keep this open, but we are also uncertain about the intentions of the archdiocese and our current pastor, which makes it very disheartening.\u201d Some opacity surrounds the church\u2019s situation. The archdiocese says that the decision to close the chapel lies squarely with the parish and that it has not threatened to cut off the loans to cover the rent. \u201cThey are trying to be good stewards of not only the parish\u2019s money, but also the archdiocese\u2019s money,\u201d said Joseph Zwilling, the archdiocese spokesman, referring to the parish\u2019s leaders. St. Joseph\u2019s pastor, Father Quinn, referred all questions about St. Joseph\u2019s Chapel to Mr. Zwilling. Since Father Quinn\u2019s arrival in July, the parish website has posted its financial balance sheet. Rent, real estate taxes and fines for St. Joseph\u2019s Chapel for the year came to $369,000, it states, but its collections were only $164,000. The parish, which consists of St. Peter\u2019s, St. Joseph\u2019s and another downtown church, Our Lady of the Rosary, borrowed $540,000 from the New York Archdiocese last year to cover the rent and other deficits, the financial statement states. Parishes are supposed to be self-sustaining and pay an annual tax of 8 percent of collections to the archdiocese. \u201cThe trustees and the members of the Finance Council believe that this significant operating loss is not sustainable and that parish expenses must be brought in line with operating revenue,\u201d the balance sheet states. The parishioners say Father Quinn has told them that means they will vacate St. Joseph\u2019s this spring unless something changes, even though the lease ends in 2019. The apparent decision to stop borrowing the money for the rent perplexes both the parishioners and the former pastor, the Rev. Kevin V. Madigan, who led the chapel on Sept. 11 and through its rededication. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a debt collector is going to come after you,\u201d Father Madigan said. \u201cThe archdiocese doesn\u2019t come after parishes to pay them back loans.\u201d Mr. Zwilling said the loans would need to be repaid only if the parish came into a financial windfall, such as from a sale of property. St. Joseph\u2019s Chapel is an unassuming, low-ceilinged place, tucked into the ground floor of the residential complex behind the tall office towers that line the West Side Highway. It was moved to its current location, about a block and a half from the World Trade Center site, in 1983; the original church next to the twin towers was demolished to make way for an office building that was never built. There are three Masses each Sunday. During the week, workers visit at lunchtime. Because of the small space, it is easy to see everyone who comes to services, creating a sense of community, Father Madigan said. \u201cBasically, it was hard to get lost there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not grand, like St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral,\u201d said Kate Megna, 31, who was praying before noon Mass at the church on a recent weekday. \u201cYou are here for your faith and for God. It\u2019s very pure.\u201d The core of parishioners who are fighting for the chapel to stay open point to the intensive effort by the Greek Orthodox Church two blocks away to rebuild St. Nicholas Church, which was destroyed on Sept. 11 and is soon to reopen as a national shrine. Roughly $38 million was raised for the striking project, on the southern end of the World Trade Center site. But the possible closing of St. Joseph\u2019s Chapel has not been the subject of a fund-raising effort by the archdiocese, or even a public statement by Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop. \u201cThe cardinal has confidence in the pastor and people of the parish that they will do what is appropriate for the overall good of the parish,\u201d Mr. Zwilling said. As rent negotiations continue, the LeFrak organization provided a statement: \u201cGateway has generously and unilaterally offered a significant reduction in rent to the church \u2014 well below the rent called for by the church\u2019s lease \u2014 as a community gesture to Battery Park City and awaits resolution from the church.\u201d And the Battery Park City Authority, the state-run agency that parishioners hope will intervene, said it could only hope for the best. \u201cWhile the state has no role in the discussions between the church and its landlord, St. Joseph\u2019s is an iconic part of the neighborhood, and we hope the parties can reach an agreement that allows the church to remain in its location,\u201d it said in a statement.", "source": "The New York Times", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "created_date": "2017-04-18T10:41:15-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/nyregion/st-josephs-chapel-sept-11-attacks.html", "title": "Chapel That Survived Sept. 11 Attacks May Not Survive Rent Increase", "item_type": "Article", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "abstract": "A chapel across from the World Trade Center, St. Joseph\u2019s, was a command station for emergency workers.
