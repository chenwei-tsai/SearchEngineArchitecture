Amelia Meath sings about \u201cfaking the truth in a new pop song/Don\u2019t you want to sing along?\u201d as the music percolates along for three-and-a-half minutes. \u201cRadio\u201d is also a collection of custom-made sounds and patterns. Here, the producer Nick Sanborn explains how \u201cRadio\u201d was constructed. This started as just a short melodic sequence, just three quarter notes long. I can\u2019t say why I latched on to it, but it sounded like it was in orbit, spinning around some other companion object and never landing. Here it is in its original state, no effects or anything. I went looking for the other half, thinking it might be something contrasting \u2014 higher, shorter, different timbre. This simple three-16th-note descending loop felt like it might be its partner. Put them together, and ta-da! They might not sound like much, but it seemed like they belonged together. I adore phasing patterns. Though the notes felt right to me, it still felt too underdeveloped to use, a pattern for pattern\u2019s sake, without further meaning. Once other pieces of the song came into focus we realized we could add contextual weight to the sound by running it through Amelia\u2019s mom\u2019s old Otari reel-to-reel tape machine, which she had recently given us. She used it in the \u201970s to cut together these beautiful radio pieces for NPR on everything from mosquitoes to rhubarb. As Amelia pressed her hand against the spinning reels and the pitch fluttered everything felt perfect, two generations of women on the radio coming together through this one sound.", "section": "Arts", "abstract": "Listen to this song\u2019s pattern evolve as Nick Sanborn explains how the track went from a simple sequence to a three-and-a-half-minute production.", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T15:46:57-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/music/sylvan-esso-radio.html", "title": "How Sylvan Esso Made \u2018Radio\u2019"}
