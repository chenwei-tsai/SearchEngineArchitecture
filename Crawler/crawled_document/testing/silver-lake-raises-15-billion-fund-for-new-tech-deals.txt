Now the firm is poised to significantly raise its buying power. Silver Lake plans to announce on Tuesday that it has closed its fifth buyout fund at $15 billion, one of the biggest ever dedicated to technology deals. That exceeds the $12.5 billion fund-raising target that the firm had previously aimed for and brings the firm\u2019s total assets and committed capital to about $39 billion. The announcement, coming as Silver Lake hosts its investors at its annual meeting in Midtown Manhattan this week, is meant to build off the kind of deals that the firm has struck in recent years. Those deals have revolved around helping portfolio companies get even bigger by buying other competitors, including Dell\u2019s purchase of EMC for $67 billion and WME\u2019s acquisition of fellow talent agency IMG for $2.3 billion. It is an approach that has garnered good results so far. Silver Lake\u2019s fourth fund, with $10.5 billion under management, currently boasts returns of nearly 31 percent, according to the data provider PitchBook. \u201cWe recognize and take seriously our responsibility to serve as stewards of capital for our limited partners and their beneficiaries in an international investment environment characterized by growing complexity, disruption and change,\u201d the firm\u2019s four managing partners \u2014 Mike Bingle, Egon Durban, Kenneth Hao and Greg Mondre \u2014 said in a statement. Much of the private equity world has turned its eyes toward technology deals. Roughly 20 percent of all American private equity deals in the first quarter were in the tech sector, according to PitchBook. That is roughly double the average for the past decade. And now some of the best-performing private equity firms focus on technology. Vista Equity Partners, an investment firm focused on reviving older software companies, has averaged returns of more than 20 percent, spurring a number of imitators. Silver Lake\u2019s new fund represents a huge sum, although it is far smaller than the $100 billion Vision fund that SoftBank of Japan has assembled for technology-focused deals. That enormous reserve, which counts the Saudi Arabian government and Apple as investors, has shaken the private equity world. Silver Lake has told its backers that it still sees plenty of opportunity, even while facing a $100 billion potential rival. Many of its most successful deals have centered on the so-called roll-ups that its portfolio companies have done. What is now Broadcom, a nearly $87 billion chip maker, began with Silver Lake\u2019s investing in the much smaller Avago and then helping it swallow ever-larger rivals. The new fund is also distinguished by a trivia note: It is the first fund not to feature any of Silver Lake\u2019s founders as its general partners. Jim Davidson, a co-founder who was listed as one of the managers of the firm\u2019s fourth fund, will not be listed as a manager for the fifth fund and will assume an emeritus status at the firm. Yet the move is in some ways ceremonial. Investment decisions at Silver Lake have been managed by its four current managing partners for more than five years.", "abstract": "The firm that has helped buy companies like Dell and Ultimate Fighting Championship is looking for more tech and media.", "section": "Business Day", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/business/dealbook/silver-lake-raises-15-billion-fund-for-new-tech-deals.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Silver Lake Raises $15 Billion Fund for New Tech Deals", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T21:30:05-04:00"}
