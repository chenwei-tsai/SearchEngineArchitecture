{"text": "BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 Venezuela said on Wednesday that it would pull out of the Organization of American States, which has long been critical of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s unyielding accumulation of power at the expense of the country\u2019s democratic institutions. The move increases Venezuela\u2019s isolation while its government is struggling to put down mass street protests demanding new elections. And it shows that the country \u2014 which, through anticapitalist rhetoric and oil largess, once aimed to challenge the United States as a power in Latin America \u2014 is becoming something of a pariah in its own region. On Wednesday evening, Foreign Minister Delcy Rodr\u00edguez said Mr. Maduro had instructed her to break ties with the organization because of what she described as \u201cintrusive, arbitrary, illegal, deviant and crude actions.\u201d She added, \u201cA faction of governments from the region had eyes on our sovereignty and tried to intervene and lecture our country, but this, fortunately, will not happen.\u201d The O.A.S., whose charter promotes democracy among member organizations in the Western Hemisphere, has become the principal body through which Venezuela\u2019s neighbors have exerted pressure as concerns mount regarding the country\u2019s stability. Experts called the decision to leave unprecedented. \u201cIt is evidence of an authoritarian character of the government, especially in the case of the O.A.S., whose pillars are to defend democracy and human rights,\u201d said F\u00e9lix Arellano, an international relations professor at the Central University of Venezuela. He added that this was the first time a country had pulled out of the organization. The decision came amid a month of huge protests against Mr. Maduro\u2019s rule that have involved looting and attacks on demonstrators and security forces. At least 26 people have died, according to human rights groups, including a 20-year-old man who the authorities say was killed during a demonstration on Wednesday. Last year, the O.A.S. invoked its Democratic Charter against Venezuela, citing an \u201calteration of the constitutional order\u201d there. The move was a rebuke of the country\u2019s ruling leftists, whom the organization accused of stifling opponents, holding political prisoners and ruling by decree. In the months that followed, Mr. Maduro\u2019s powers increased, and the organization\u2019s demands became louder. On March 29, Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court, controlled by loyalists of the president, moved to dissolve the National Assembly and assume powers for itself. The ruling was described by the O.A.S. secretary general, Luis Almagro, as \u201ca self-inflicted coup.\u201d After an international outcry, Mr. Maduro quickly told the Supreme Court to roll back much of the ruling, but legislators say they remain essentially powerless. On Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr. Almagro \u2014 who had warned that Venezuela faced suspension from the organization \u2014 said that in order to withdraw, the country would have to wait two years and pay a debt of $8.7 million under O.A.S. rules. David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the two-year departure window meant the organization could continue to discuss Venezuela, regardless of whether it is planning to quit. He noted that the rupture came after years in which Venezuela accused the O.A.S. of being a pawn of Washington and tried to undermine it by establishing alternative regional bodies. \u201cBut symbolically, this is important,\u201d Mr. Smilde added, saying it showed that Venezuela\u2019s neighbors were losing patience. For years, Venezuela was bolstered by friendly leftist governments throughout the region. But now, old stalwarts like Brazil and Argentina are governed by right-of-center leaders, and Cuba, once Venezuela\u2019s closest ally, has opened diplomatic relations with the United States.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-organization-of-american-states-protests.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T22:27:33-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T22:27:33-04:00", "abstract": "The country plans to pull out of the Organization of American States, which has long criticized President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s unyielding accumulation of power.", "title": "Venezuela Says It Will Leave Pro-Democracy Organization"}
