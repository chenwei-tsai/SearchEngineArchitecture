Mr. Sessions\u2019s description of Hawaii, where the federal judge who issued the order, Derrick K. Watson, has his chambers, drew a rebuke from both of the United States senators who represent the state. Annexed as a territory of the United States in the late 19th century, Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959. \u201cHawaii was built on the strength of diversity & immigrant experiences \u2014 including my own,\u201d Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, wrote on Twitter. \u201cJeff Sessions\u2019 comments are ignorant & dangerous.\u201d The other senator from Hawaii, Brian Schatz, who is also a Democrat, expressed similar sentiments, writing on Twitter: \u201cMr. Attorney General: You voted for that judge. And that island is called Oahu. It\u2019s my home. Have some respect.\u201d Asked for a response from Mr. Sessions, Ian Prior, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said in an email: \u201cHawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific \u2014 a beautiful one where the attorney general\u2019s granddaughter was born. The point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the president\u2019s lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe.\u201d (The State of Hawaii is a chain of islands, one of which is also called Hawaii; the judge\u2019s chambers, however, are in Honolulu, which is on the island of Oahu.) Judge Watson, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, was confirmed in 2013 by a 94-to-0 vote; Mr. Sessions, then a United States senator from Alabama, was among those who cast an approving vote. A former federal prosecutor, Judge Watson earned his law degree from Harvard alongside Mr. Obama and Neil M. Gorsuch, the newly seated Supreme Court justice. He is the only judge of native Hawaiian descent on the federal bench. Last month, Judge Watson issued a nationwide injunction blocking President Trump\u2019s travel ban, ruling that the plaintiffs \u2014 the State of Hawaii and Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii \u2014 had reasonable grounds to challenge the order as religious discrimination. He cited comments dating to Mr. Trump\u2019s original call, during the 2016 campaign, for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d During the arguments, the government had contended that looking beyond the text of the order to infer religious animus would amount to investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cveiled psyche,\u201d but Judge Watson wrote in his decision that there was \u201cnothing \u2018veiled\u2019\u201d about Mr. Trump\u2019s public remarks. Still, Mr. Sessions reiterated that line of argument in the radio interview, saying he believed that the judge\u2019s reasoning was improper and would be overturned. \u201cThe judges don\u2019t get to psychoanalyze the president to see if the order he issues is lawful,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cIt\u2019s either lawful or it\u2019s not.\u201d", "abstract": "The attorney general\u2019s comments, related to a federal judge\u2019s ruling that blocked the Trump administration\u2019s latest travel ban, drew criticism from lawmakers.", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T21:59:08-04:00", "title": "Jeff Sessions Dismisses Hawaii as \u2018an Island in the Pacific\u2019", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/us/politics/jeff-sessions-judge-hawaii-pacific-island.html"}
