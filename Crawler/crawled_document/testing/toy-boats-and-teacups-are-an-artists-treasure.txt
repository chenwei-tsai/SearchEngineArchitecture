{"text": "The artist Donald Sultan describes himself as something of a pack rat. \u201cI have sort of a penchant for old things,\u201d he said. Photography, pottery, drawings, prints \u2014 he started collecting during his eight years of summers working in St.-Tropez, going to French markets, acquiring what he calls \u201cdoodads.\u201d \u201cI just kept buying things,\u201d Mr. Sultan said in a recent interview at the TriBeCa home he moved into about two years ago, which doubles as his studio. The space is filled with examples of his \u201cDisaster Paintings,\u201d images of fire and industrial mishaps that are touring the country and go on view at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington on May 26. His home includes works by Lewis Hine, Cy Twombly, Man Ray and Lotte Jacobi. Among Mr. Sultan\u2019s obsessions are toy boats \u2014 some of which he keeps in his house in Sag Harbor, N.Y. \u2014 as well as pocketknives, shoehorns, watches and teacups. \u201cEverything has to be real,\u201d Mr. Sultan said. \u201cI don\u2019t have reproductions of anything.\u201d These are edited excerpts from our conversation. What attracts you to these objects?  I like things that are handmade. I found this guy in England who makes pancheons, old-fashioned bread bowls. He\u2019s probably the only guy in the world that makes these things and he makes them for me when I need them. Do you use them?  Oh, yeah. I don\u2019t make bread, but I use them as bowls \u2014 wonderful. There are very few people who can do that kind of stuff. Growing up in Asheville, N.C., I was surrounded by potters, people who made jewelry, and glass blowers \u2014 although I\u2019ve never gotten into glass. Have these collections made their way into your own work?  Probably not. I have used some of the pots that I collected in my paintings as vases, especially in the late \u201980s and \u201990s, when I was doing the big flower paintings. I used vases that people gave me or that I\u2019d gotten in St.-Tropez. But not any more than that. What do you keep in Sag Harbor? I have one room that\u2019s full of weapons. I decided I wanted to bring my grandfather\u2019s shotgun from the \u201920s. A guy gave me this very nice L .C. Smith side-by-side shotgun and another guy gave me a pump-action 16-gauge shotgun and we shoot skeet now. I found a beautiful ax at one of the antique stores; it turns out it\u2019s called a hewing ax and it was meant for skinning logs to make log cabins. Then someone gave me a beautiful African hat made of buttons because I did button paintings. I\u2019ve got arrows from the Maori and the Yanomami and Apaches, and straw hats from when I was in China. I have a print by Winslow Homer of a ship at sea in a storm. Do you ever sail your toy boats? I used to. Now I give them to my granddaughter and she plays with them in the bathtub. Are you out on the water much yourself? No, I don\u2019t like to get on a boat and then not be able to get off. It\u2019s boring, actually, and a lot of the boats that they have out there are motorboats, so you\u2019re in a thing going rrr, rrr \u2014 it takes the fun out of being on the water.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/design/toy-boats-and-teacups-are-an-artists-treasure.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T12:28:09-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T12:28:09-04:00", "abstract": "Donald Sultan describes himself as a pack rat, and his collections include earthenware bowls and weapons.", "title": "Toy Boats and Teacups Are an Artist\u2019s Treasure"}
