{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "To celebrate 40 years of darkness, the galaxy\u2019s favorite villain has taken on a much shinier disposition. For less than the cost of a trip to Tatooine, one lucky Star Wars fan will soon be able to own a solid gold Darth Vader mask \u2014 perfect for bartering, though perhaps not so good for heavy breathing. On Tuesday, the Japanese jeweler Ginza Tanaka unveiled the imposing headgear and announced that it would go on sale at the company\u2019s flagship store in Tokyo on May the fourth (do we need to spell this out for you?) to celebrate Star Wars\u2019 40th Anniversary. The price? A mere 154 million Japanese yen, or about $1.4 million. Tax included! Its vendors describe the mask as life-size \u2014 26.5 centimeters by 30 centimeters to be exact. But in an email, a spokesperson for Ginza Tanaka noted, \u201cUnfortunately, you cannot wear this mask because it is too heavy.\u201d Indeed, the Force will have to be strong with you to lift the mask. It is about 33 pounds of 24-karat gold \u2014 enough to easily crush an enemy\u2019s throat. Ginza Tanaka is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year, the spokesperson said, and \u201ccreated this golden mask both because \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d is set to premier in December, and because the company simply wanted to create the saga\u2019s \u201ciconic character, \u2018Darth Vader,\u2019 with gold.\u201d Because, you know, who doesn\u2019t? If you find yourself trying to justify dropping $1.4 million on a golden helmet, Ginza Tanaka has already crunched the numbers for you. It set the price of one gram of gold at about 4,900 yen, or about $44. That means the mask's gold alone is valued at about $658,000, roughly half the asking price. Still, if the mask is a little out of your price range, you might consider a commemorative solid gold coin instead. Sets of three will run about $11,000 \u2014 but for that you get about 100 grams of gold and a replica poster. And the competition for these coins may turn out to be as fierce as a podrace; there are only 77 sets, a number chosen because the first Star Wars movie debuted in 1977. And if you\u2019re surviving on more of a Death Star maintenance worker\u2019s salary, never fear. Single 10-gram gold coins \u2014 one featuring Yoda and another depicting a lightsaber battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader \u2014 are priced around $1,200. In a statement written in Japanese, the company called the products exquisite fan items that express the allure of Star Wars through Ginza Tanaka\u2019s craftsmanship. Creating Star Wars products, they said, highlights just how global their brand really is.
