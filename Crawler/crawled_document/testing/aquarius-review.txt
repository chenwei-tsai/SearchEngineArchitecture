{"text": "It\u2019s easy enough to say what makes an apartment a home \u2014 fond memories, shelves full of cherished books and records, a heap of living \u2014 but it\u2019s harder to specify what makes a home a metaphor. Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s new film, \u201cAquarius,\u201d takes place mostly in and around the apartment where its heroine, a 65-year-old music critic named Clara, has lived for much of her adult life. Its rooms are spacious and sunny (the Atlantic Ocean is right across the street), but an intimation of hidden significance drifts in with the light and the breezes, a hint that Clara\u2019s home might also be a microcosm of modern Brazil. Mr. Mendon\u00e7a Filho has been here before. Not to this particular building, which gives its name to the movie, his second fictional feature, but to this nexus of place, story and theme. Judging from \u201cAquarius\u201d and its predecessor, \u201cNeighboring Sounds,\u201d you could say that this director, a former film critic, specializes in movies about real estate in Recife, capital of the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco. In the sense, that is, that Herman Melville specialized in books about sea voyages. \u201cNeighboring Sounds\u201d was set in a high-rise housing complex that was both background and protagonist, a concrete symbol of Brazil\u2019s social divisions past and present. Aquarius is a more modest structure, a tidy stucco edifice with an enviable location and, for Clara at least, a rich history. In a mostly superfluous prologue, we see her (played by Barbara Colen) in 1980, celebrating the birthday of her free-spirited aunt Lucia (Thaia Perez). After that party, where we meet Clara\u2019s husband and children and learn that she is recovering from breast cancer, the action leaps forward to the present, and \u201cAquarius\u201d finds its groove. Clara, now a widow and portrayed by the great S\u00f4nia Braga, is the last remaining resident of Aquarius and is determined to resist the efforts of the building\u2019s owners to get rid of her. Sometimes this involves tense, decorous exchanges with the proprietor\u2019s grandson (Humberto Carr\u00e3o), a young man with a slick, ingratiating manner and a North American business degree. At other times low-level harassment and passive-aggressive revenge is involved. Clara, whose walls are lined with LPs and decorated with movie posters (Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cBarry Lyndon\u201d figures prominently) is adamant in her refusal to budge. At stake is not just one woman\u2019s comfort but also everything she represents. Ms. Braga is a living embodiment of the glories of Brazilian cinema, and Clara, while a less-celebrated figure, is in her own way an avatar of the nation\u2019s cultural traditions. The author of a monograph on the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, she is a musical connoisseur with eclectic tastes (she likes Queen as well as samba) and a rigorous, passionate ear. She is not an easy person to deal with, but there is no denying the force of her personality, the reach of her intellect or the intensity of her appetites. Mr. Mendon\u00e7a Filho invites the audience to take Clara on her own terms, without pity or condescension, and he insists at every moment on her individuality. Her temperament is woven from a unique blend of sandpaper and silk, and most of the film is devoted to exploring its textures and seams. The main plot \u2014 Clara\u2019s battle with the financial expedience and bottom-line corruption of the real estate company \u2014 flickers in and out of view, so that we can spend time in her company. Which means that we also get to know her children, her beloved nephew, her long-serving housekeeper, her best friend and the \u201cprofessional help\u201d Clara hires when she wants sex and grows impatient with dating men her own age. \u201cAquarius\u201d is a marvelous and surprising act of portraiture, a long, unhurried encounter with a single, complicated person. And that is enough to make it a captivating film, an experience well worth seeking out. But there is also, as I\u2019ve suggested, more going on than the everyday experiences of a modern matriarch. Clara\u2019s particularity is precisely what makes her such a resonant and representative figure, because it\u2019s her idiosyncratic spirit that is threatened by the sterility and greed represented by her mercenary antagonists. This is, in other words, a political film, and it\u2019s not surprising that it has been caught up in the drama of recent Brazilian politics. In an exchange of letters recently published in Film Comment, Mr. Mendon\u00e7a Filho has noted the parallel between Clara and Brazil\u2019s former President Dilma Rousseff, impeached earlier this year in what the filmmaker and many other Brazilian artists and intellectuals describe as a right-wing legislative coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. \u201cAquarius\u201d has become a rallying point for the embattled Brazilian left, but even viewers with scant knowledge of the situation in that country will be aware of the film\u2019s timeliness, which is less a matter of ideology than of sensibility. It can be argued that Clara\u2019s fight, and the artistic vision that supports it, has a conservative dimension. Clara represents values that look, in the current climate, decidedly old-fashioned. She is a warrior for aesthetic distinction, for critical thought, for sexual and creative liberty \u2014 for things that cannot be bought, sold or indexed. And she is not someone you want to go up against in a fight. \u201cAquarius\u201d is not rated. It is in Portuguese, with English subtitles.
