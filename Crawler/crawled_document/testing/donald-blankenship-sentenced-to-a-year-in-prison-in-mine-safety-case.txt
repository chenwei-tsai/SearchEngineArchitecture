Blankenship, whose leadership of the Massey Energy Company catapulted him from a working-class West Virginia childhood into a life as one of the wealthiest and most influential men in Appalachia, was sentenced on Wednesday to a year in prison for conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards. The prison term, the maximum allowed by law, came in Federal District Court here six years and one day after an explosion ripped through Massey\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine, killing 29 men. Although Mr. Blankenship was not accused of direct responsibility for the accident, the deadliest in American coal mining in about 40 years, the disaster prompted the inquiry that ultimately led to his conviction. Federal officials have said that last autumn\u2019s guilty verdict was the first time such a high-ranking executive had been convicted of a workplace safety violation. \u201cYou should be someone that we are able to tout as a West Virginia success story,\u201d Judge Irene C. Berger, herself the daughter of a coal miner, said before she described Mr. Blankenship\u2019s career, in which he earned tens of millions of dollars and gained remarkable sway over this state\u2019s politics and people. But, she said, \u201cInstead of being able to tout you as one of West Virginia\u2019s success stories, however, we are here as a result of your part in a dangerous conspiracy.\u201d Minutes earlier, standing in the courtroom where jurors heard weeks of evidence before they convicted him of a single misdemeanor, Mr. Blankenship said, \u201cMy main point is wanting to express sorrow to the families and everyone for what happened.\u201d As he spoke, relatives of dead miners cried in the courtroom\u2019s gallery, and one wiped her face with a crumpled piece of paper. Mr. Blankenship, however, was also defiant and told Judge Berger, \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that everyone knows that I am not guilty of a crime.\u201d Judge Berger also ordered Mr. Blankenship, 66, to serve a year of supervised release and to pay a fine of $250,000, a sum well above what federal sentencing guidelines suggested, but she refused requests for restitution payments. The judge denied Mr. Blankenship\u2019s request to remain free pending an appeal; unless an appeals court intervenes, he will begin his term within months. Not long ago, it was virtually unthinkable that Mr. Blankenship, whom jurors acquitted of several felony charges, would ever stand before a judge for a sentencing in West Virginia. Mr. Blankenship acknowledged as much on Wednesday, when he said, \u201cI never thought, by the way, that I would be thanking a probation officer because I never expected to have one.\u201d But after the explosion at Upper Big Branch on April 5, 2010, the authorities turned to a novel approach to prosecute Mr. Blankenship, who possessed deep knowledge of his mines, recorded many telephone conversations with subordinates and received production reports every 30 minutes. Throughout a lengthy, complex trial, government officials portrayed Mr. Blankenship as, in effect, the kingpin of a criminal enterprise, and one with a stubborn focus on Massey\u2019s financial standing. His demands, prosecutors argued, contributed to an unspoken conspiracy that employees were to ignore safety standards and practices if they threatened profits. \u201cHe knew that following the safety laws costs money,\u201d Steven R. Ruby, an assistant United States attorney, said at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWhat could be more serious than a crime that risks human life?\u201d Mr. Ruby, who urged Judge Berger to order a one-year sentence, argued that a lighter penalty \u201cwould signal that committing mine safety crimes might be a good gamble for a C.E.O.\u201d A lawyer for Mr. Blankenship said that the government had exaggerated Mr. Blankenship\u2019s behavior, in part to bolster the political fortunes of R. Booth Goodwin II, the United States attorney who oversaw the case. (Mr. Goodwin, who attended the sentencing hearing, resigned soon after the trial ended and is now a Democratic candidate for governor.) He has said that his political ambitions played no role in the case. The lead defense lawyer, William W. Taylor III, said that the government had advanced a \u201csimplistic theory\u201d of criminal culpability and had essentially argued that Judge Berger \u201cshould punish this man as if the jury convicted him of being a homicidal monster.\u201d \u201cThe worst that can be said is that Mr. Blankenship knew about the violations and, in the government\u2019s view, that he didn\u2019t do enough to prevent them,\u201d said Mr. Taylor, who had sought a sentence of a fine and probation. \u201cThe one thing you cannot conclude is that Don Blankenship was not interested in, and didn\u2019t care about, the safety of his miners.\u201d After the hearing, another of Mr. Blankenship\u2019s lawyers, Eric R. Delinsky, said outside the courthouse, \u201cWe won most of the case before, and we\u2019re going to win the rest of it on appeal.\u201d For the Justice Department, which opened its investigation into Massey\u2019s dealings a day after the catastrophe at Upper Big Branch, the Blankenship case carried a mixed result, particularly because prosecutors failed to convince jurors that Mr. Blankenship was guilty of crimes that carried greater penalties. But they also won a significant verdict. The trouble for the government, legal specialists said, was that few executives manage the day-to-day details of their companies as closely as Mr. Blankenship, and his leadership style made it difficult to know whether the Justice Department would be able to replicate its success, limited as it was, in future cases. \u201cThe Justice Department will be emboldened in the sense that it\u2019s a successful prosecution, and successful prosecutions always embolden prosecutors,\u201d said David M. Uhlmann, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a former chief of the Justice Department\u2019s environmental crimes section. \u201cBut there are not likely to be a lot of cases where senior executives were involved to the degree that Don Blankenship was in the day-to-day running of the company.\u201d Although the trial, and the maximum sentence that Mr. Blankenship faced, brought new attention to mine safety laws, Congress has demonstrated little interest in imposing tougher penalties. Outside the courthouse on Wednesday, some relatives of Upper Big Branch miners vowed that they would press, here and in Washington, for more stringent safety standards. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a misdemeanor,\u201d said Gary Quarles, whose son, Gary Wayne Quarles, was among those who died in the explosion. \u201cIt should have been a felony.\u201d Some family members, including Mr. Quarles, found a measure of satisfaction in the sentence. \u201cThere is some peace to know that he is going to serve some time,\u201d said Shirley Whitt, whose brother, Howard D. Payne, died at Upper Big Branch. \u201cMaybe that will give him an opportunity to reflect on the kind of person he\u2019s been over the years.\u201d Others remained vocally angry at Mr. Blankenship. As he spoke to reporters, when he again denied wrongdoing, and later walked to a minivan, men shouted at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t miss your kids like we miss ours,\u201d one man yelled. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d someone screamed, \u201ceven know their names!\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
