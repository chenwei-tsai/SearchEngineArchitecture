You\u2019re a young woman with no qualms about traveling abroad on your own. Before you hit your bucket-list destinations, however, there are some factors to keep in mind when it comes to your personal safety and cultural mores around the world. Here, experts share their top tips for young women traveling alone. 1. Some Destinations Are Better Suited Than Others While most places in the world are safe for solo female travelers, including parts of the Middle East like Oman and Qatar, they are more likely to feel welcome in certain destinations, according to Karen Schragle, a travel adviser and the president of Wayland Travel, who frequently travels by herself and also creates itineraries for other such women. These destinations include New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam, Singapore, Iceland, Japan, Canada and anywhere in the United States. \u201cCulturally, these countries don\u2019t frown upon women who are on their own, and often, the locals there even go out of their way to offer us their help,\u201d she said.

Dress Like a Local Ms. Schragle said that women should stick to clothing similar to what local women wear. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel more confident navigating your way around and also avoid uncomfortable stares,\u201d she said. Err on the side of modesty \u2014 in some countries, for example, women rarely wear shorts. A safe choice, even in places where ethnic clothing is the norm, is a long skirt, ankle boots, long sleeves and a jean jacket. If you are planning to visit holy sites or certain areas of the Middle East, it\u2019s smart to have a head scarf or shawl handy. And avoid flashy jewelry, even of the costume variety, said Greg Boles, an associate managing director at Kroll Security Risk Management and travel safety specialist. \u201cThieves don\u2019t know the difference between what\u2019s real and fake, and you\u2019re basically saying, \u2018Come rob me,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cPlay it safe by blending in with the crowds.\u201d 3. Plan Airport Transportation Don\u2019t take a local taxi from the airport to your hotel. \u201cIt\u2019s best to have transportation booked in advance from a trustworthy car service company because in some areas of the world, such as Mexico, it\u2019s not uncommon for kidnappers to pose as drivers and pick up unsuspecting women at the airport,\u201d Mr. Boles said. Find a reputable company through your hotel concierge, an on-the-ground tour operator or your travel adviser back home. 4. Have an Itinerary (and Share It) Yes, the pleasure of a vacation is having unstructured time to explore, but both Mr. Boles and Ms. Schragle advised having a half-day of activity planned for each day of your trip and emailing a copy of this itinerary to a relative or friend. When you\u2019re unfamiliar with a city and have too much free time, you risk wandering into areas where you shouldn\u2019t go, and having an agenda lets others keep a tab on where you are. A travel adviser who specializes in your destination can help create your itinerary, and many don\u2019t charge a fee for their service. Find one on Virtuoso.com, a global luxury travel network, or AmexTravel.com, a global travel network with 9,000 agents, or by emailing Signature Travel Network, a consortium of travel agents, at info@signaturetravelnetwork.com. 5. Splurge on Your Hotel It may be tempting to save cash by booking a no-frills hotel or hostel, but when you\u2019re traveling alone, Ms. Schragle recommends higher-end accommodations, which are more likely to have an in-the-know staff. \u201cYour hotel staff will be able to give you tips on where to go for affordable shopping, the restaurants to dine in if you\u2019re eating alone and be generally helpful with anything you need,\u201d she said. 6. Be on Guard at Nightclubs and Bars Of course it\u2019s fun to get a taste of the local night life, but never let a stranger buy you a drink, said Mr. Boles, and watch the bartender vigilantly while he\u2019s making your cocktail or pouring you that glass of wine. \u201cSomeone can easily slip drugs into your drink that leave you disoriented or unconscious, which makes you more vulnerable to sexual assault, and many times bartenders are the culprits or act in conjunction with the perpetrator,\u201d he said. Also, since you\u2019re probably leaving the venue late at night, book transportation back to your hotel through the property\u2019s concierge. Want more?
