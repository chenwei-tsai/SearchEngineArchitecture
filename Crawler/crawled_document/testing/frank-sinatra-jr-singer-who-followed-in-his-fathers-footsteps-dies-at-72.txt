He was 72. The cause was cardiac arrest, his sister the singer Nancy Sinatra wrote on Facebook. Mr. Sinatra had been scheduled to perform on Wednesday night at the Peabody Auditorium in Daytona Beach; his show, \u201cSinatra Sings Sinatra,\u201d featured his renditions of his father\u2019s famous songs, with orchestral accompaniment, stories and videos. His career echoed his father\u2019s from the start \u2014 he even sounded remarkably like him on stage \u2014 though it never reached the stratospheric heights of stardom Frank Sr. had known. At 19, Frank Jr. was singing with the Tommy Dorsey band, a version of the ensemble the elder Sinatra had sung with more than two decades before. \u201cYoung Mr. Sinatra has taken careful note of every aspect of his father\u2019s singing,\u201d The New York Times wrote in 1963. \u201cHe knows \u2014 and projects \u2014 the inflections, the shading, the phrasing that his father used.\u201d Later that year Frank Jr.\u2019s name was in headlines nationwide when he was kidnapped at gunpoint from a casino in Nevada. He was freed, unharmed, a little more than two days later, after his father paid $240,000 in ransom. Three men, Barry Worthington Keenan, Joseph Clyde Amsler and John William Irwin, were convicted of the kidnapping, despite defense lawyers\u2019 claim that it had been a publicity stunt. \u201cThe criminals invented a story that the whole thing was phony,\u201d Mr. Sinatra said in an interview with The Guardian in 2012. \u201cThat was the stigma put on me.\u201d Unlike Nancy Sinatra, who reached the top of the pop singles charts with \u201cThese Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 \u201d in 1966, Mr. Sinatra never had a hit record. But he continued to perform in Las Vegas and elsewhere, releasing a handful of albums and making occasional television appearances. He appeared as himself in two episodes of \u201cFamily Guy\u201d; last year he sang the national anthem at Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers games. He began touring with his father as the elder Sinatra\u2019s conductor and musical director in the late 1980s. He had seen little of his father while growing up, and he said the role allowed them to form a bond, if only in his father\u2019s last years. (Frank Sinatra died in 1998.) \u201cWhen I came on board, Sinatra was already 72,\u201d he told The Guardian. \u201cHe was slowing down.\u201d Francis Wayne Sinatra was born on Jan. 10, 1944, in Jersey City. His mother, the former Nancy Barbato, was Frank Sr.\u2019s first wife. The two had met before he became a star \u2014 \u201cthe nice girl from the neighborhood his mother was determined he would marry,\u201d as The Daily News of New York described her in 1998, adding that it was \u201ca marriage made in Hoboken, not heaven.\u201d Frank Jr. \u2014 the \u201cJr.\u201d was part of a stage name; his father\u2019s full name was Francis Albert Sinatra \u2014 was the second of three children born to the couple, who divorced in 1951. Besides his sister Nancy, Mr. Sinatra is survived by his mother; a son, Michael; and another sister, Tina Sinatra. Mr. Sinatra was married for two years in the late 1990s. In an interview with The Daytona Beach News-Journal shortly before his death, Mr. Sinatra said he was not bitter about not having repeated his father\u2019s success. \u201cI think in my generation, when I came along in the early \u201960s, the type of music that was in vogue in society in those days had moved on to another kind of music,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to sell antiques in a modern appliance store.\u201d", "abstract": "Unlike his sister Nancy, Mr. Sinatra never had a hit of his own. \u201cI was trying to sell antiques in a modern appliance store,\u201d he said."}
