{"text": "Dolly Levi certainly knows how to make an entrance. But then, of course, so does Bette Midler. On Thursday night, about two hours after she had basked in a full-throated standing ovation from the celebrity-studded crowd at the opening night of \u201cHello, Dolly!,\u201d the twice Oscar-nominated actress, who plays the title role, appeared at the top of the steps of the New York Public Library dressed in a midnight blue, floor-length custom Marchesa gown. As she strutted into the party, John Pizzarelli and his band played \u2014 what else? \u2014 \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d Accompanied by her husband, the artist Martin von Haselberg, who smiled wryly at her side, she beamed and gave a slightly regal wave as guests shouted out her name, hummed along to \u201c\u2026 have you back where you belong,\u201d and took out their smartphones to capture the moment for their Twitter and Instagram accounts. A few minutes later, after weaving through a crowd that included a wide swath of New York\u2019s celebrity elite \u2014 among them Sigourney Weaver, John McEnroe, Greta Gerwig, Lorne Michaels, Sarah Paulson, Zadie Smith, John Slattery, Andrew Rannells, Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue \u2014 Ms. Midler stood off in a corner of one of the library\u2019s towering spaces and talked about what it was like to take on an iconic role that had been played over the years by such  legends as Carol Channing, Ann Miller, Martha Raye, Pearl Bailey and, on film, Barbra Streisand. \u201cIt was an honor, and a challenge, to take on such a great role that so many amazing women had done before me,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to make sure I honored them.\u201d And what was she feeling earlier that evening, what was going through her mind, as the audience stood, cheered and stomped their feet as she took her triumphant curtain call? \u201cRelief, sheer relief,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life,\u201d harder even, she added, than the one-woman show, \u201cI\u2019ll Eat You Last,\u201d she did on Broadway in 2013 or any of her concert tours over the years. \u201cThe stress has been just incredible,\u201d she said with a shake of her head. \u201cCan you believe Carol Channing did something like 7,000 performances of this show?\u201d Around her the party was in full swing, and the recurring topic of conversation was Ms. Midler\u2019s return to Broadway in a musical more than 40 years after appearing in the original production of \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d \u201cIt was worth the wait,\u201d chirped an ebullient Michael Kors, calling her performance \u201cone for the ages\u201d and professing not to be miffed that Ms. Midler had chosen another designer for her outfit that night, even though she had often worn his clothes in the past. \u201cBut, you know, given how great she was tonight, if she had shown up here in a burlap bag, I would have been thrilled.\u201d The cabaret performer Bridget Everett, ducked out of the way as a never-ending stream of waiters passed by bearing trays of beef Wellington, chicken potpies and flutes of Champagne. She said she had been overwhelmed both by Ms. Midler\u2019s performance and the show itself. \u201cI cried three times,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the singing of \u2018Hello, Dolly!,\u2019 at the finale, and then at the curtain call, all three times out of sheer joy.\u201d Among the people in that curtain call was the actor Gavin Creel, who plays \u201cchief clerk\u201d Cornelius Hackl. He called it an \u201cout of body experience\u201d to share the stage with Ms. Midler in this revival of the Jerry Herman/Michael Stewart musical. \u201cShe\u2019s someone I\u2019ve just idolized forever,\u201d he said. \u201cEmbarrassingly \u2014 no, not embarrassingly \u2014 I can recite \u2018Beaches\u2019 from start to finish. Probably 'Big Business' as well. But I have to say that I\u2019m not on stage with \u2018Bette Midler.\u2019 That\u2019s not a movie star up there. That\u2019s an actress who is a perfectionist and is totally committed to this role and the woman she is playing.\u201d Earlier, the young Oscar-nominated actor Lucas Hedges (\u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d), born more than three decades after the original production opened on Broadway in 1964, called Ms. Midler\u2019s performance \u201cmagical\u201d and said \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d was \u201cthe kind of show you can\u2019t imagine anyone trying to do today.\u201d (Perhaps betraying both his youth and his limited knowledge of theatrical lore, he did ask, \u201cWho did it originally, Barbra Streisand?\u201d) The author and playwright Paul Rudnick (currently developing a musical version of \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d), knew of course that the role had been created by Carol Channing and said he had actually seen her. \u201cI saw the absolute last Carol Channing tour,\u201d he said triumphantly. That show, he said, \u201chad its own magic to it, but it was nothing like this. This was just staggeringly wonderful.\u201d \u201cI think what was so surprising about this production was how moving it is, how emotional,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s because people are in such a state of anxiety right now, that we needed this concentrated burst of happiness. I haven\u2019t been in a room full of that many happy people in quite a while.\u201d Later, when Ms. Midler was told of Mr. Rudnick\u2019s comments \u2014 \u201cOh, was Paul here? I\u2019m so pleased\u201d \u2014 she said she agreed with his assessment that the time was right for a revival of a show like \u2018Dolly.\u201d \u201cI do think it has an important message for us right now,\u201d said Ms. Midler, who has been an active critic of President Trump on her Twitter feed. \u201cThat all these people, with all these differences, these conflicts, can come together in a joyous way.\u201d She added that the original production of \u201cHello, Dolly!,\u201d when it was in tryouts in Washington, opened about a week after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. \u201cI think that show, with its message of hope, really helped people come together and heal after that tragic event. It\u2019s a message that we need today, perhaps more than ever.\u201d With that, Ms. Midler glided back into the throng of admirers waiting to offer their congratulations. \u201cNow that\u2019s royalty,\u201d someone said as she passed. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else like her.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/fashion/hello-dolly-bette-midler-party.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T15:05:01-04:00", "abstract": "New York\u2019s celebrity elite feted Ms. Midler\u2019s return to Broadway as Dolly Levi.", "title": "Bette Midler, Michael Kors and Lucas Hedges Celebrate After \u2018Hello, Dolly!\u2019 Opening", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Fashion & Style", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T15:05:01-04:00"}
