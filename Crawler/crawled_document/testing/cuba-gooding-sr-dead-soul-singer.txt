He was 72. The coroner\u2019s office said that the cause was under investigation. Mr. Gooding\u2019s body was found in a car parked on a busy street in the Woodland Hills section. Mr. Gooding, the father of the Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr., rose to fame as the lead singer of the rhythm-and-blues group the Main Ingredient. The group\u2019s biggest hit, \u201cEverybody Plays the Fool,\u201d reached No. 3 on the Billboard pop singles chart and No. 2 on the R&B chart. It made enough money to enable him to move with his family from the Bronx to Southern California. Mr. Gooding\u2019s own father had fled Barbados for Cuba \u2014 hence his son\u2019s name \u2014 before becoming a taxi driver in Manhattan. Mr. Gooding was born in New York City on April 27, 1944, to Dudley MacDonald Gooding and the former Addie Alston. He joined the Main Ingredient after the group\u2019s original lead singer, Donald McPherson, died in 1971. The group\u2019s other hits included \u201cJust Don\u2019t Want to Be Lonely\u201d and \u201cHappiness Is Just Around the Bend,\u201d both in 1974. Mr. Gooding left the Main Ingredient in 1977 but returned in 1979 after releasing two albums as a solo artist for Motown. He left again in the late 1980s and released solo albums in 1993 and 2004. In addition to his son Cuba Jr., his survivors include his wife, the former Shirley Sullivan; two other sons, Omar, an actor, and Tommy, a musician; a daughter, April Gooding, an actress and comedian; and grandchildren.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T21:30:24-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Gooding, the father of the Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr., rose to fame as the lead singer of the rhythm-and-blues group the Main Ingredient.", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T23:35:36-04:00"}
