My daughter started missing her daddy and tearing up that she wanted her daddy with her. I got the call to console her, but no words seemed to work that evening. I suddenly remembered The Times\u2019s Mini Crossword, which we had started doing together, and asked her if she wanted to do that. All tears forgotten, we went about solving that one, in four minutes over the phone. We are still going strong with the Mini Crossword together, every single night, and try to beat our best time: 1 minute 12 seconds.
