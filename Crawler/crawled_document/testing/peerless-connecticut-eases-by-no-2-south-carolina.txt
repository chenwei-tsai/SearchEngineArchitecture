{"text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014  It was not a hopeless blowout, but it felt like a rout. In the process of handling its closest out-of-conference rival, Connecticut demonstrated it remains in a league of its own. A showdown with second-ranked and unbeaten South Carolina was supposed to give the No. 1 Huskies their first quality challenge since December victories over Notre Dame and Maryland. A raucous capacity crowd announced at 18,000 jammed Colonial Life Arena for the occasion. In the end, the score \u2014 66-54, Connecticut \u2014 did not reflect the relative ease with which Huskies (23-0) dealt the Gamecocks (22-1) their first home defeat in 46 games. In recording their 60th straight victory dating to early last season, Coach Geno Auriemma\u2019s Huskies, who are shooting for an unprecedented fourth straight national championship, kept the talented Gamecocks 21 points below their season scoring average (75.1). They did it with suffocating defense at the point of South Carolina\u2019s attack with Moriah Jefferson and inside with Breanna Stewart and, especially, Morgan Tuck, who dominated South Carolina\u2019s 6-foot-4 center, Alaina Coates. \u201cThey pushed us out a lot farther in the scoring area \u2014 just disruption,\u201d Gamecocks Coach Dawn Staley said. \u201cPasses are longer; everybody\u2019s a step or two outside where they can be effective.\u201d At the other end, UConn\u2019s relentless motion offense, running off the high post, and the three star seniors \u2014 Stewart (25 points), Tuck (16) and Jefferson (12) \u2014 were too much for South Carolina to handle. \u201cI start to blink, because I look out there and start to think that these three are not going to be there next year,\u201d Auriemma said, getting ahead of himself while calling the preparation for this game \u201ca whole different vibe.\u201d It is no secret that Connecticut\u2019s league, the American Athletic Conference, provides scant competition for a team once accustomed to being pushed \u2014 if seldom pummeled \u2014 in the Big East by Notre Dame, Louisville and Rutgers. This season, the Huskies had won every league game by at least 40 since Jan. 10, when they beat South Florida, 75-59. Still, Auriemma bristled at the suggestion that this game was \u201ca litmus test\u201d for his team. \u201cFive of the teams in this conference should join our conference,\u201d he said, referring to the Southeastern Conference, where the Gamecocks play. \u201cThey probably need to play us more.\u201d Staley had called the game \u201ca great opportunity to measure ourselves on our home court\u201d \u2014 in part a reference to the 25-point thrashing the Huskies had dealt the Gamecocks in last season\u2019s showdown of Nos. 1 and 2. At that point, South Carolina was unbeaten, and Connecticut had absorbed the one defeat (at Stanford in overtime) that it would be dealt all season. South Carolina has been an ascendant program under Staley, in her eighth year after six seasons at Temple and a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame career as a college and pro point guard. With her star player, the 6-5 A\u2019ja Wilson, only a sophomore, Staley is positioned to remain Connecticut\u2019s main foil in the coming seasons. Whereas other national programs have avoided Connecticut in recent years, Staley has eagerly scheduled the Huskies. Auriemma said after the game that the home-and-home series would continue for at least two seasons. He also said his schedule might soon be crowded. \u201cI got five phones now with people calling me who want to play us when these three guys leave,\u201d he said, with Stewart, Tuck and Jefferson next to him in the interview room. Having replaced Tennessee as the reigning SEC power, South Carolina, Auriemma said, is ahead of where Connecticut was in the early-to-mid-1990s, when the Huskies began to alert the Volunteers that they were coming for their share of national titles. Unlike Connecticut \u2014 which has one in-state player, the seldom-used guard Tierney Lawlor, and no others from New England \u2014 South Carolina has a more regional makeup to its roster, with five players from the state and a total of nine from the Carolinas and Georgia. The Gamecocks do play in a more competitive conference, but playing against the best of the rest does not necessarily prepare anyone for the likes of Stewart, a 6-4 do-everything star who acknowledged that she was so excited for this game that she, and Jefferson, played every minute of it. Off the opening tip, Stewart put her head down and drove left to drop in a layup. Clearing her throat, she showed off her whole offensive repertoire, scoring 13 points in the first half on aggressive drives and clever head fakes that freed her for jump shots. The Gamecocks struggled to stop the Huskies in transition, but their problems began with poor offensive execution in the face of the Huskies\u2019 pressure. Wilson made her first four shots, but South Carolina was rarely able to penetrate the defense. The Gamecocks committed 11 first-half turnovers, and the shot clock ran down or expired on them too often as they fell into a 15-point hole. They cut their deficit to 10 by halftime, but Tuck, struggling with her surgically repaired knee of late, began the second half with 6 quick points as part of a 9-4 run to help push UConn\u2019s lead back to 15 on the way to 21. Before heading home, Auriemma said he expected to see the Gamecocks again in the Final Four, leaving his audience with the presumption that only an unthinkable upset could stop the Huskies from joining them.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/sports/ncaabasketball/peerless-connecticut-eases-by-no-2-south-carolina.html", "published_date": "2016-02-07T19:00:00-05:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T03:00:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T03:00:07-04:00", "abstract": "A showdown with the Gamecocks was supposed to give the No. 1 Huskies their first quality challenge since December; instead, Connecticut used suffocating defense to win its 60th straight.", "title": "Peerless UConn Eases by No. 2 South Carolina"}
