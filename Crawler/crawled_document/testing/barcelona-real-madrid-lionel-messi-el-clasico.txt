Messi scored from inside the penalty area after a cross by Jordi Alba two minutes into stoppage time of el Cl\u00e1sico, leaving the rivals tied in points. Barcelona is ahead on the head-to-head tiebreaker, but Madrid still has a game in hand. Casemiro had put Real Madrid ahead in the 28th minute, and Messi tied the score five minutes later after evading two defenders inside the penalty area for his first goal at Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium since 2014. Ivan Rakitic put Barcelona ahead with a powerful left-footed shot from outside the penalty area in the 73rd minute, but Madrid tied the score with a goal by the substitute James Rodr\u00edguez in the 85th, despite playing a man down from the 77th after Sergio Ramos fouled Messi. It was the second consecutive win by Barcelona at the Bernab\u00e9u. It had routed Real Madrid, 4-0, last season in a game that eventually led to the replacement of Madrid Manager Rafa Ben\u00edtez by Zinedine Zidane.", "abstract": "Messi scored from inside the penalty area two minutes into stoppage time at Madrid, leaving the Spanish league\u2019s title race up for grabs."}
