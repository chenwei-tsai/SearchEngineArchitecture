{"abstract": "There are so many services to stream films that it is easy to get lost. But digging is half the fun.", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T11:13:09-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "title": "Acorn TV, Urban Movie Channel, Shudder: Exploring Fringe Caves Online", "material_type_facet": "News", "text": "Not to belabor the obvious, but when you\u2019re writing about streaming services, you discover a lot of them \u2014 and then find a whole lot more. I suppose you would learn that anyway, scrolling through offerings on Amazon Fire or Google Chromecast or a Roku, or just an app store. One could spend a month or more digging around Hero Talkies (\u201cWatch Tamil Movies\u201d) or InTube (\u201cWatch Indian Films\u201d) or Hindi Movies (no tagline, but pretty self-explanatory). You also learn that services come and go. If you click on an app for a service and get a message that it hasn\u2019t updated for the current operating system on your device, there\u2019s a good chance its extinction is imminent. Learning that a streaming site has up and disappeared is arguably more irritating than finding out a movie you\u2019ve had on a service\u2019s watchlist has been deleted from the service. That said, much of the excitement of streaming is in the ability to get more of what you love (or think you might love). Acorn TV, an offshoot of Acorn Video, is not primarily a movie service. But a lot of movie lovers I know (not to mention my in-laws) swoon over it, because its mix of British and Australian TV series runs a gamut of genres (mysteries and comedies are particular strengths) and feature casts filled with familiar faces from films both Hollywood and not. (Incidentally, Sigourney Weaver had a cameo role on an episode of the cozy iTV series \u201cDoc Martin\u201d in 2015 \u2014 she approached the series\u2019s lead actor, Martin Clunes, while they were both on a British talk show and told him how much of a fan she was. The episode, \u201cFacta Non Verba,\u201d is on the Acorn service.) Better-than-decent adaptations of classic material like Agatha Christie\u2019s \u201cThe Witness for the Prosecution\u201d are plentiful on Acorn. And the movies it does have are largely noteworthy. There\u2019s the 2002 BBC Film \u201cThe Falklands Play,\u201d a fast-paced, quick-witted movie about the Falklands War in which the great British actress Patricia Hodge (\u201cBetrayal\u201d) portrays Margaret Thatcher, a performance that actually gives Meryl Streep\u2019s portrayal of the British prime minister in \u201cThe Iron Lady,\u201d from 2011, a run for its money. \u201c44 Inch Chest,\u201d a 2009 adultery-and-kidnapping drama that\u2019s a sharp critique of male sexual jealousy, has a spectacular cast of indefatigable lads: Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, John Hurt, Tom Wilkinson, Stephen Dillane, Steven Berkoff. The service also features the great Australian director Gillian Armstrong\u2019s 1992 domestic drama, \u201cThe Last Days of Chez Nous,\u201d with Miranda Otto, Kerry Fox and Bruno Ganz. The service is available as a website and an app, and on Roku, Amazon Fire and Chromecast, and costs $4.99 a month (a yearly subscription can be had for $49.99). In February, this column covered Brown Sugar, a service dedicated to Blaxploitation movies, most from the 1970s. Such films represent a pretty narrow segment of cinema by or about African-Americans. The Urban Movie Channel ($4.99 a month, $49.99 a year), created by Black Entertainment Television\u2019s founder, Robert L. Johnson, in late 2014, aspires to a wider range. Some solid, underappreciated films found on the site include \u201cSecond Coming,\u201d a 2014 marital drama starring Idris Elba and Nadine Marshall, and \u201cThe We and the I,\u201d from 2013, directed by Michel Gondry, an inventive story (set on a public bus) of Bronx high schoolers on their last day of classes. The Urban Movie Channel, or UMC, also features five features directed by the Ghanaian filmmaker Leila Djansi, including her most recent, \u201cLike Cotton Twines,\u201d from 2016. The drama is a sensitive, beautifully shot story about \u201ctrokosi,\u201d described in the opening as \u201ca practice of religious slavery found in parts of Western Africa,\u201d in which a virgin girl is given up by a family whose member has been found guilty of a crime. The picture depicts an American teacher in Ghana (Jay Ellis of the HBO series \u201cInsecure\u201d) attempting to rescue a student from being traded away by her father. Some aspects of the site are a little befuddling; a \u201cClassics\u201d section features both the 1977 horror picture \u201cThe Hills Have Eyes\u201d (arguably a classic) and the 1986 affirmative-action blackface comedy \u201cSoul Man\u201d (absolutely not a classic). Just as it has much of everything, Amazon Video has a lot of horror, ranging from last year\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cThe Witch\u201d to the cult classic \u201cThe House on Sorority Row\u201d (1983) to microbudget no-name pictures for which the streaming service provides an ostensible shot at finding an audience. Netflix has a little over 250 horror movies, many of them classics \u2014 \u201cThe Legend of Hell House,\u201d from 1973, loomed large in my early-teen years, because it\u2019s really scary, and also because it touched off my lifelong crush on the actress Pamela Franklin. But some of them aren\u2019t horror movies at all: \u201cScary Movie 2,\u201d from 2001, is a parody of horror movies; last year\u2019s \u201cYoga Hosers\u201d is just an actual horror. Connoisseurs can find more conscientiously curated delights at Shudder ($4.99 per month, $49.99 per year) and Screambox ($4.99 per month, $35.88 per year). Shudder is big on exclusives, including the recent \u201cPrevenge,\u201d a thriller about a pregnant woman\u2019s killing spree, written, directed by and starring Alice Lowe, whose pregnancy in the film was authentic. The New York Times critic Jeanette Catsoulis called it \u201ca brilliantly conceived meditation on prepartum anxiety and extreme grief.\u201d There are also international pictures, such as the 2003 French nouvelle-slasher flick \u201cHigh Tension\u201d and the 2007 Japanese period ghost story \u201cKaidan,\u201d directed by Hideo Nakata, who made the 1998 classic \u201cRingu.\u201d Screambox is very full-throttle and fan-oriented, with not just horror fare but also documentaries celebrating the likes of the \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d franchise. The grind-house nostalgist in me was delighted to find two 1981 obscurities: the Italian filmmaker Lucio Fulci\u2019s mortifying gorefest \u201cThe Beyond\u201d and \u201cThe Nesting,\u201d an interesting novelty in which the New York sexploitation filmmaker Armand Weston tried to go mainstream, with mixed results. (It also happens to be the American \u201940s and \u201950s screen siren Gloria Grahame\u2019s final film, and one you are unlikely to see on TCM.) Screambox and Shudder are not exactly replete with transcendent masterpieces, and honestly, neither are Acorn and UMC. But even the most refined viewer knows that masterpieces are not always the point. Digging for something is half the fun.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T11:13:09-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/movies/acorn-tv-urban-movie-channel-shudder-streaming-movie-services.html", "item_type": "Article"}
