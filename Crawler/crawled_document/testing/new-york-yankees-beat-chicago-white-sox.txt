There was the potential double-play grounder that shortstop Pete Kozma booted in the seventh inning, the bunt that Austin Romine might have let drop for another double play in the same inning, and ultimately the slider that Luis Severino hung to Avisail Garcia that sailed out of sight and put the game out of reach. A different outcome on any one of those plays could have kept alive the Yankees\u2019 longest winning streak in nearly five years, not to mention \u2014 14 games into the season \u2014 put them atop the American League East, a position they never reached in 2016. And the Yankees had yet another chance in the ninth inning, when they loaded the bases against their former closer David Robertson and had Aaron Judge, their hitter most likely to launch a baseball onto River Avenue, at the plate. Judge made solid contact, but only to rap a grounder to shortstop for a game-ending forceout. It was a frustrating defeat that could lead to second-guessing. Had Manager Joe Girardi not chosen to give Chase Headley, his everyday third baseman, the night off, forcing Girardi to play the rarely used Kozma at short, who knows what might have happened on Melky Cabrera\u2019s tailor-made double-play ball? But the bottom line, to borrow one of Girardi\u2019s favorite expressions, is this: The Yankees lost for the first time since April 8 because they could manage only four hits, none of which left the infield, while allowing two that left the ballpark. That is how a close game \u2014 the White Sox were clinging to a 1-0 lead until Garcia\u2019s home run \u2014 becomes a tough loss. The Yankees\u2019 offense, which had averaged more than six runs a game during the club\u2019s eight-game winning streak, could get nothing going against White Sox starter Miguel Gonzalez, who handcuffed them for eight innings before faltering in the ninth. The Yankees\u2019 pitching, so solid throughout their win streak, was solid again on Tuesday, with Severino working a career-high eight innings, allowing just three hits, walking none and striking out 10. Had it not been for those two pitches, the slider to Avisail Garcia and a fastball to Leury Garcia in the third inning that fell to earth in the Yankees\u2019 bullpen, the Yankees\u2019 clubhouse might have been as jubilant as it had been for the previous nine days rather than silent and virtually deserted. \u201cI mean, you feel like you\u2019ve really got a chance there,\u201d Girardi said about the Yankees\u2019 ninth-inning mini-rally, in which they scored their only run of the night when Robertson walked Starlin Castro to force in a run. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the middle of the order coming up and some guys who have hit some home runs, and you feel that you\u2019ve got a chance there. But we didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d But the futility of this game did not erase the encouraging signs the team had shown in its previous eight games. When the Yankees decided last July to part ways with Aroldis Chapman, Andrew Miller, Carlos Beltran and, soon afterward, Alex Rodriguez, it was assumed that a team built around young players would need at least a couple of years to ripen into a contender. But after the first 13 games of 2017, the Yankees found themselves with more wins than they managed all of last April \u2014 the horrific month that doomed them last season \u2014 and as many wins as any team in the American League. They had managed it with a surprisingly efficient offense and an even more surprising pitching rotation, which had turned in quality starts in seven of their eight consecutive wins and had posted a 2.77 staff E.R.A. Severino, who had struck out 11 in seven innings in his last outing, a win over the Tampa Bay Rays, was every bit as good against the White Sox, an encouraging sign for a pitcher who looked like a potential Cy Young winner in his rookie season of 2015 but was relegated to the bullpen after going winless in 11 starts last season. \u201cHis stuff was as good tonight as we\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate we didn\u2019t turn the double play in the seventh, and it changed the complexion of the inning. But I thought he pitched as well tonight as he ever has.\u201d Severino absolved Kozma of blame on the error. \u201cPete Kozma is a great defensive player,\u201d Severino said, adding that he knew Kozma was not trying to make an error. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the game.\u201d And Romine scoffed at the notion that he might have let the bunt off the bat of Avisail Garcia, the Sox\u2019 cleanup hitter who is batting .440 with three homers and 13 R.B.I., drop for a possible double play. \u201cIf he wants to bunt there, that\u2019s a gift to us,\u201d Romine said. \u201cYou take an out where you can get an out.\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
