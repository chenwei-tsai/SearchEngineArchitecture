A first-half goal by Saul Niguez proved enough to ease the Spanish side through to the last four despite Leicester\u2019s spirited revival in the second half when Jamie Vardy equalized on the night. Diego Simeone\u2019s side, who won the first leg in Madrid, 1-0, had the better of the opening exchanges, but Leicester finally found its feet, with Shinji Okazaki firing over the goal frame from close range. It was the visitors who struck first, though. Saul extended Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s overall lead in the 26th minute, heading it home powerfully off Filipe Lu\u00eds\u2019s superb cross. Leicester City, the Premier League champions who were in their first Champions League campaign, responded strongly, dominating the second half. Vardy tied it in the 61st minute after Ben Chilwell\u2019s shot was blocked, but it was not quite enough.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/sports/soccer/atletico-madrid-beats-leicester-city-champions-league.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T17:12:20-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Ends Leicester City\u2019s Champions League Run", "created_date": "2017-04-18T17:12:20-04:00", "section": "Sports"}
