But not just any fear \u2014 the specific kind of fear that stands between what you want to do and actually doing it. And, as I expected, I got a lot of responses from people who weren\u2019t exactly convinced. \u201cI would quit my job, but I need the health insurance.\u201d \u201cI would try to sell the book, but it requires another 100 hours of work I simply don\u2019t have right now.\u201d Many people had completely legitimate responses. They were convinced their reasons were based on prudence, not fear. And maybe all those people are right. But what I find really interesting is that you could have two different people who want to do the same thing, and they have identified the exact same roadblock (like health insurance as a roadblock to quitting your job and starting your own company). But one of them decides to ignore the roadblock (however risky that may be) and do it anyway, while the other decides to focus on the roadblock instead. Isn\u2019t that interesting? Two people, same circumstances, two completely different results. So, I want you to come on a quick journey. Suspend your disbelief, and consider this as a bridge between what we say we want to do and actually doing it. It\u2019s a short bridge, just six steps. Step 1: Get stoked You know what it is to be stoked, right? It\u2019s unbridled enthusiasm. Words like passion and motivation don\u2019t even scratch the surface of getting stoked. Think of it as potential energy or a compressed spring waiting to explode. That stoking is what transforms dreaming into doing. For me, it\u2019s stories like the USA Men\u2019s Rafting Team trying to break a speed record on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. For you, maybe it\u2019s listening to Beethoven. It doesn\u2019t matter what stokes you. What matters is that you go back, figure it out and rekindle that stoke. Step 2: Get fear out of the driver\u2019s seat We are going to pretend fear is a person. Fear is your friend. But, let\u2019s follow Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s lead in her latest book \u201cBig Magic.\u201d \u201cDearest Fear, Creativity and I are about to go on a road trip together. I understand you\u2019ll be joining us, because you always do \u2026 You\u2019re allowed to have a seat, and you\u2019re allowed to have a voice, but you are not allowed to have a vote. You\u2019re not allowed to touch the road maps or suggest detours; you\u2019re not allowed to fiddle with the temperature. Dude, you\u2019re not even allowed to touch the radio. But above all else, you are absolutely forbidden to drive.\u201d Not an Elizabeth Gilbert fan? Will Smith is instructive on the topic too. This video is two minutes very well spent. Step 3: Those objections are excuses, not reasons Just for the time being, assume that nothing on your list of roadblocks (I\u2019m talking to you, Mr. Health Care and Ms. 100 Hours) is more than an excuse. Look, I don\u2019t know you. I don\u2019t know your situation. Maybe your roadblocks are absolutely legitimate. But just for this experiment, may I humbly suggest: Assume that no matter how real you think they are, they are just excuses. Step 4: Find a quiet place with something big to write on Get calm, get centered, do your sun salutations, whatever it takes. When you\u2019re focused, look at that white board. Step 5: Ask yourself one question  Now that you\u2019re in the right space \u2014 you are focused, fear isn\u2019t driving, you are stoked, and all those things on your list are just excuses \u2014 ask yourself: What comes next? Cross health care, 100 hours, whatever completely legitimate reason you have off the list (remember, this is a thought experiment). Then, answer the question, \u201cWhat comes next?\u201d Or better yet, \u201cWhat comes now?\u201d Step 6: Write that next thing down and go do it And when you are done with that, and you don\u2019t know what to do next (because, of course, you still need health care, and you still need 100 hours, and you still need \u2026), go back to Step 1, and repeat. What if you just did that thing you wrote down in Step 6? What would happen? And then what would happen if you repeated this process again, every day, for three months, six months, a year? What might that look like?
