By last Tuesday, that number had dwindled to 10, mainly small-budget spots for a pain relief cream and a bedding retailer, MyPillow.com. Days later, the Fox News star Bill O\u2019Reilly was out \u2014 taking with him a payout of up to $25 million \u2014 a strikingly swift fall ushered in by an advertising exodus that rattled the highest reaches of the Fox empire and delivered an unsettling message to corporate America: You\u2019re on notice. Some staff members expressed frustration that Mr. O\u2019Reilly received such a lucrative package after being ousted over sexual harassment allegations. In an era when outrage can be easily channeled online, major brands are well aware of the risk of revolts from consumers who are increasingly savvy about hitting companies where it hurts. Brands are not waiting to dissociate themselves from thorny issues that might alienate their customers, be it Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behavior or a North Carolina law against transgender bathrooms. \u201cThe allegations are disturbing,\u201d a Mercedes spokeswoman, Donna Boland, said in a blunt statement after the company pulled its \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d ads. \u201cGiven the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don\u2019t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now.\u201d Lost revenue is one matter and tarnished reputation another. If the financial fallout from the O\u2019Reilly backlash was relatively minor \u2014 many advertisers simply shifted their spending to other Fox News programs \u2014 it was difficult to ignore the public image of at least 50 major brands withdrawing support from the network\u2019s most popular host. Companies are \u201ca bit on edge about how they engage and react in this moment,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, an online racial justice group that encouraged its million-plus members to protest Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behavior. \u201cOn the one hand, they\u2019re trying to reach a broad audience, and on the other, they\u2019re trying to maintain a loyal consumer base and loyal employees,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPlacing their brands next to figures or platforms that don\u2019t have to adhere to the same standards their employees do can often lead to problems.\u201d Numerous social-media-savvy groups are capitalizing on that to potent effect, both to expose where advertisers are placing their ads and to mobilize people into registering their concerns. The online boycott campaign #GrabYourWallet, aimed at brands tied to President Trump, has pressured companies like Nordstrom and T.J. Maxx to stop carrying products connected to Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter. Uber, the popular ride-sharing app, came under fire after accusations that it tried to profit from a protest against President Trump\u2019s executive order barring refugees and immigrants from certain countries from entering the United States. A trending hashtag, #DeleteUber, prompted thousands of users to dump the app; Uber\u2019s chief executive later stepped down from a position on Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory council. In interviews, leaders of the online campaign to topple Mr. O\u2019Reilly said they believed that while Fox News management would stand behind its star anchor, the network might be vulnerable to other pressures. Shareholders and the executives at its multinational parent company, 21st Century Fox, could be more attuned to the consequences of a large-scale advertising strike. \u201cYou need to be able to mobilize supporters to mount enough public pressure that they feel they need to respond,\u201d Angelo Carusone, the president of the liberal website Media Matters and a veteran of advertiser boycott campaigns, said of Fox News. \u201cYou\u2019re actually making a business case that keeping him on is inherently risky.\u201d Shannon Coulter, a founder of #GrabYourWallet, said that consumers \u2014 women, in particular \u2014 were realizing their own power. \u201cThere\u2019s this growing consciousness that our consumer dollars are basically funding our own oppression in some cases,\u201d Ms. Coulter said in an interview. \u201cThat we are the customers of companies that are buying advertising that supports workplace environments that support serial sexual harassment.\u201d She added: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dots being connected right now between consumers and companies. And the ease of contacting a company through social media is fueling it and adding gasoline to the fire.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s downfall started this month, shortly after The New York Times reported that he had settled with five women over claims of harassment and inappropriate behavior. Mr. O\u2019Reilly has denied the allegations against him. Even veteran activists were taken aback by how swiftly the company responded. In the early years of the Obama administration, Color of Change slowly mounted pressure on advertisers to distance themselves from Glenn Beck, then a Fox News provocateur. This time around, the group spent only two and a half weeks on its anti-O\u2019Reilly effort. \u201cOur effort around Glenn Beck took two years and hundreds of advertisers,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. He said that many of his members drew a direct connection between Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behavior and that of President Trump, who defied allegations of sexual harassment and assault to win the election. The fact that Mr. Trump publicly defended Mr. O\u2019Reilly, calling him \u201ca good person\u201d during an Oval Office interview, only intensified the activists\u2019 resolve. \u201cThat further inflamed the grass roots, and women in general,\u201d said Letitia James, the New York City public advocate, who organized protests outside Fox News\u2019s Manhattan headquarters and has called for further investigations into the network\u2019s workplace culture. At the time of his final show on Fox News, Mr. O\u2019Reilly was scoring some of his highest Nielsen ratings in years and remained the No. 1 draw on cable news. But the cultural and corporate pressures on his employer won out. Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, said Fox News probably recognized that installing a replacement anchor for Mr. O\u2019Reilly would not necessarily lead to a giant drop-off in viewers. And even if advertisers had stuck with Mr. O\u2019Reilly, Mr. Wieser added, the situation raised other questions. \u201cIs it harder to attract talent at Fox because of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s presence, or is it harder to book on-air guests?\u201d he said. \u201cOr is morale so low such that people are unproductive because they feel there\u2019s a risk that\u2019s looming?\u201d News of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure was met with jubilation by some online activist groups, including Sleeping Giants, a popular Twitter account created in November to pressure brands into removing ads that appear on Breitbart News. The anonymously run account had extended its mission this month, urging advertisers to pull sponsorship from Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show. \u201cThanks to all of the Giants, the many collaborators and the advertisers who stood up to sexual harassment,\u201d the group wrote in a Twitter post on Wednesday. \u201cYou did this.\u201d", "abstract": "Advertisers\u2019 desertion of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d led Fox News to dismiss him, and even veteran activists were taken aback by how swiftly the company responded.", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T22:15:47-04:00", "title": "Sponsor Fears of Consumer Revolt Felled Bill O\u2019Reilly at Fox", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/business/media/fears-of-revolt-by-consumers-felled-bill-oreilly.html"}
