Mr. Pence is wrapping up an Asia-Pacific tour in which he has sought to affirm America\u2019s commitment to the region after President Trump sent mixed signals to close allies, including Australia. A tense phone call in late January between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull set off a storm of criticism in Australia just as some in the country were calling for reconsidering its alliance with the United States and tilting more toward China. Mr. Pence\u2019s visit is believed to be the earliest ever by an American vice president to Australia in a new administration. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. did not come until 2016, as his tenure was nearing its end, although former President Barack Obama had paid a call sooner, in his third year in office. \u201cPence is coming just three months into the administration, which is particularly noteworthy,\u201d said Dougal Robinson, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney. \u201cAfter the Trump-Turnbull phone call, he\u2019s clearly here to try and reassure Australian political leaders.\u201d That call turned contentious after Mr. Turnbull pressed Mr. Trump to honor an agreement to accept hundreds of refugees from an Australian detention center. Mr. Trump abruptly ended the conversation and posted on Twitter that the agreement was a \u201cdumb deal.\u201d During an interview on Australian television on Thursday, Mr. Turnbull said he trusted \u201cthe judgment, the wisdom of the American government, the president\u201d and \u201cthe vice president.\u201d \u201cOur alliance with the United States is vital,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said. \u201cThe commitment is so deep on both sides, it will survive many prime ministers and many presidents.\u201d Mr. Pence\u2019s visit is expected to be a low-key affair, except for an event in Sydney on Saturday in which he will speak with senior business leaders about the economic relationship between Australia and the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s about showing U.S. economic commitment to the region and to Australia after the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u201d trade deal, Mr. Robinson said. Mr. Pence will meet with Mr. Turnbull, as well as Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, and Bill Shorten, the leader of the opposition Labor Party. Mr. Turnbull said the visit by Mr. Pence showed the Trump administration\u2019s dedication to the region. \u201cWe will be talking about a range of issues, but obviously the top of the agenda will be regional security,\u201d he said. \u201cNorth Korea is going to be right at the top of the agenda.\u201d Mr. Pence is also expected to address the fight against terrorism and the two nations\u2019 \u201ccommitment to destroy the Islamic State.\u201d Trade issues and security will also be discussed, Mr. Turnbull said. James Carouso, the acting United States ambassador to Australia, said the visit was an effort to reassure Australians of the closeness between the countries and the value that America put on the relationship. \u201cThis is something the new administration intends to work on going forward,\u201d Mr. Carouso said.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T07:54:21-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/australia/mike-pence-visit-sydney-turnbull.html", "item_type": "Article"}
