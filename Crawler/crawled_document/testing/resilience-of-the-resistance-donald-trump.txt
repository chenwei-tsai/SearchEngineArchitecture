As we approach the 100th day of the Trump administration, a tremendous amount of attention and coverage will be devoted to analyzing its impact and efficacy. But I would also like to take time to celebrate the impact and efficacy of the resistance. I must say that the issue of resilience was one that I worried and wondered about from the beginning: For far too many Americans in this digital age, stamina is rare, attention spans are short and the urge for instant gratification, or at least for expedient resolution, is enormous. I worried that modern shortsightedness would prevent resisters from seeing the long game, that the exhaustion of constant outrage would numb them to unrelenting assault. But, to my great delight, my worry was unfounded. Not only is the movement still strong, it appears to be getting stronger. People have found a salve for their sadness: exuberant agitation. Far from growing limp, the Trump resistance is stiffening and strengthening. As John Cassidy put it this month in a progress report on the resistance in The New Yorker: \u201cIndeed, what is striking is how many people Trump has mobilized who previously didn\u2019t pay very much attention to what happens in Washington. He has politicized many formerly apolitical people; ultimately, this may be among his biggest achievements as president.\u201d These comments came specifically in reference to the throngs of resisters showing up at lawmakers\u2019 town hall events, sometimes in record numbers. They are passionate, vocal and confrontational. They are not bowing down; they are holding their representatives accountable and giving a very visual reinforcement to the threat that defending Trump or supporting his agenda will be punished at the ballot box. The Republican House Oversight and Government Reform chairman, Jason Chaffetz, who made a surprise announcement last week that he would not seek re-election in 2018, found this out firsthand. As Mother Jones put it: \u201cThe once-brash congressional inquisitor has twisted himself into a pretzel trying to explain why he hasn\u2019t been investigating President Trump, the most conflict-ridden commander-in-chief in modern U.S. history. And the 50-year-old congressman has experienced an unexpected level of outrage in his own deep red district.\u201d In February, constituents swarmed Chaffetz\u2019s town hall in efforts to (what he called) \u201cyell and scream.\u201d At the time he put on a defiant face: \u201cI thought it was intended to bully and intimidate. But, the last four elections in Utah in a row I\u2019ve won the widest margin of anybody playing at this level.\u201d Well, that\u2019s over. Not only are people showing up to town halls, they are clogging their lawmakers\u2019 phone lines, which is surprisingly important. As Kathryn Schulz pointed out last month in The New Yorker: \u201cThere are a great many ways to petition the government, including with actual petitions, but, short of showing up in person, the one reputed to be the most effective is picking up the phone and calling your congressional representatives.\u201d Schulz went on to explain: \u201cFor mass protests, such as those that have been happening recently, phone calls are a better way of contacting lawmakers, not because they get taken more seriously but because they take up more time \u2014 thereby occupying staff, obstructing business as usual, and attracting media attention.\u201d Furthermore, young people are particularly unhappy with Trump and turning against him. A Gallup poll released last week found that the percentage of respondents age 18-34 who believed Trump keeps his promises fell a whopping 22 points in the two months from early February to early April, from 56 percent to just 34 percent. According to a Pew Research Center survey, young people aged 18-29 also give Trump his highest disapproval rating (63 percent) of any age group. But these young people aren\u2019t just stewing and complaining. They\u2019re taking action. As Time magazine reported earlier this month: \u201cFor more than 15,000 students across the country, Wednesday marked the first day of Resistance School \u2014 a program where the educational focus is mobilizing against President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\u201d As the magazine explained, the \u201cschool\u201d was organized by \u201ca group of Harvard graduate students\u201d and offers \u201clessons on mobilizing activists and sustaining long-term resistance.\u201d Finally, and perhaps most importantly: money. Wired magazine reported this month that the resistance is \u201cweaponizing data\u201d with the emergence of a new nonprofit, crowdsourcing fund-raising tool called Flippable. It was founded by \u201cthree former Hillary Clinton campaign staffers\u201d and pinpoints \u201cwhich districts it believes are the most competitive for Democrats (the most \u2018flippable\u2019)\u201d and allows donors to target those districts. Taken together, all signs are looking up for the movement. The Trump administration, from pillar to post, is an unmitigated disaster, lumbering forward and crushing American ideas and conventions as it does. Damage is being done, there is no doubt, but Americans are not taking it lying down. They are standing in opposition. They are feeling their power. They are energized, and I\u2019m very much encouraged.", "abstract": "Not only is the movement against Trump still strong, but it appears to be getting stronger."}
