But in China, where the state controls much of the news media, the headlines have been subdued. Over the past two weeks, as North Korea has tested missiles and the United States has threatened to send warships to the region, there was just one fleeting front page reference to the tensions in People\u2019s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. Experts say Beijing\u2019s relative silence may be an attempt to placate both Kim Jong-un of North Korea and President Trump, as well as to prevent the Chinese public from panicking. Here is a look at the themes dominating coverage of North Korea in the Chinese media, and what they reveal about Beijing\u2019s attitude toward Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. China, as one of North Korea\u2019s few remaining allies and its primary source of food and oil, has long been criticized for not doing more to rein in its volatile neighbor. So the news media there seemed to rejoice when, following a recent meeting in Florida with President Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump told Fox News that \u201cChina\u2019s trying to help us.\u201d A clip of the interview went viral in China, where headline writers liberally reinterpreted Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. State-controlled news sites put words in his mouth. \u201cChina treats us so well,\u201d one outlet quoted Mr. Trump as saying. In the interview, Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi: \u201cWhat am I going to do, start a trade war with China in the middle of him working on a bigger problem, frankly, with North Korea?\u201d But the Chinese media summed up that sentiment as: \u201cAnd now you\u2019re asking me to stab China in the back? Don\u2019t you have a conscience?\u201d That remark also inspired memes like the one above, published by Sina Finance, a news portal. The image in the meme, already popular in China, is a visibly perturbed yellow bird, apparently representing Mr. Trump. The caption below it reads: \u201cDon\u2019t you have a conscience?\u201d On Chinese television, no discussion of North Korea is complete without footage of bombs and warplanes, helping to reinforce an image of American military aggression. In this segment, which aired on CCTV, China\u2019s state broadcaster, such footage accompanied commentary on whether the United States will go to war with North Korea. On North Korea and other issues, the Chinese news media often portrays the United States as a meddling, militaristic force. In this cartoon, published by Global Times, a stridently nationalist tabloid, the United States is depicted as a menacing man in a top hat, falsely accusing other countries of wrongdoing. Mao Zedong once said China and North Korea, longtime Communist allies, were \u201cas close as lips and teeth.\u201d But the relationship has suffered setbacks in recent years as frustration in China has grown over the North\u2019s volatile behavior. Still, Chinese news outlets continue to treat the regime with some deference. When Pyongyang recently put on a military parade, the Chinese media covered it faithfully. In this CCTV clip, a news announcer dryly narrates the parade, commenting on its \u201coriginality\u201d and adherence to Soviet style. The North Koreans proudly displayed missiles at the event, which they claim could soon carry nuclear warheads. But during the segment, any plans for a North Korean nuclear weapon simply went unmentioned.", "section": "World", "title": "Chinese Media Is Subdued in the Face of North Korea-U.S. Standoff", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/world/asia/chinese-media-is-subdued-in-the-face-of-north-korea-us-standoff.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T14:13:43-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T14:13:43-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
