No 1-800-line psychic will tell you. No notice sent by registered mail. Not even a ping from your iPhone. But there are a million ways of figuring it out, and we\u2019ve asked some people when they knew. Here is one way: When you feel as if you\u2019re riding an emotional roller coaster. Nate Berkus, a 45-year-old interior designer and the co-star of the TLC show \u201cNate and Jeremiah by Design,\u201d was taken with Jeremiah Brent, also an interior designer, on their first date in 2011. Mr. Berkus and Mr. Brent went shopping at a vintage furniture store, then for a walk by the Hudson River in New York. They went back to Mr. Berkus\u2019s apartment to talk, and he remembers being overcome by the feeling that he was meant to be with this man. Except Mr. Brent lived in Los Angeles and got on a plane the next morning. So began months of cross-country airplane trips and late-night telephone calls. As exciting as it was, it was also fraught with anxiety, since they both felt the tug of \u201che loves me, he loves me not.\u201d \u201cWe kept trying to figure out what this was, and was it what we thought it was, and what if it was, then what?\u201d Mr. Berkus said. Six months into their relationship, on a vacation in Mexico, they had a big fight. While planning their day, Mr. Brent, now 32, accused Mr. Berkus of being bossy. Mr. Berkus said Mr. Brent was being difficult. Eighteen hours later, they stopped for coffee and, standing on the roadside, had it out. The argument circled back to their feelings for each other. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you trust this?\u201d Mr. Berkus yelled. \u201cI\u2019m the one.\u201d Something about the way he had said it resonated with Mr. Brent. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said. They embraced and kissed. \u201cIt was a verbal commitment that both of us were truly in this,\u201d Mr. Berkus said, \u201cand a lot of the anxiety surrounding our relationship disappeared after that.\u201d We would like to hear about the moment you knew \u2014 and how you knew \u2014 that you were in love.
