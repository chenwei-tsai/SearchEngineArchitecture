Messina, of course, had coached against Porzingis in two games this season, both wins for the Spurs. But Friday was their first meaty opportunity to get to know each other. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s absolutely believing that he\u2019ll be a great, great player in this league,\u201d Messina said. Talk of Porzingis\u2019s potential has been a consistent theme around the Knicks this season, and he found a decent-size stage when he played for Messina in the N.B.A.\u2019s Rising Stars Challenge on Friday night at Air Canada Centre. Afterward, Messina tried his hand at making a comparison \u2014 a popular pursuit for people who want to give Porzingis\u2019s unusual skills some perspective. Messina, a longtime coach in Europe, said that Porzingis reminded him of Toni Kukoc, the former forward who once played alongside Michael Jordan with the Chicago Bulls. At 6 feet 11 inches, Kukoc could create offense and shoot 3-pointers \u2014 a matchup nightmare for defenders who were unaccustomed to roaming out to the perimeter. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of Kukoc in him, in my opinion,\u201d Messina said. \u201cToni was probably, at his age, a better ballhandler and could do more things off the dribble.\u201d Messina was not being critical of Porzingis. Rather, he was suggesting that he hoped to see Porzingis further develop that part of his game. Imagine the delicious possibilities for a 7-foot-3 power forward capable of dribbling past defenders in the open court. Who would be able to stop him? \u201cI\u2019m just talking as a fan and a lover of the game,\u201d Messina said. Friday\u2019s game was devoid of defense, which meant that Porzingis had a blank canvas. He drove to the basket for dunks. He launched teardrop 3-pointers. He collected 30 points and 5 rebounds while shooting 12 of 16 from the field and 5 of 8 from 3-point range. Mostly, though, he was upset that his World team fell to the United States team, 157-154. \u201cIt never feels good to lose,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not too happy about the loss.\u201d At the same time, Porzingis appreciated his seat at the kids\u2019 table ahead of Sunday\u2019s main event, the N.B.A. All-Star Game. Many pundits (and opposing coaches) believe that Porzingis, 20, will be a staple at All-Star weekends for years to come, and he seemed to make the most of his first experience here. At his pregame news conference, Porzingis fielded questions in English, Spanish and Latvian. He did meet-and-greets with fans. He went on social media to do some heavy lifting on behalf of his sponsors. Porzingis has a way of handling all of his obligations with ease, a rare quality for someone his age and for someone so new to the league. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to kind of relax a little bit,\u201d he said before Friday\u2019s game, \u201cbut at the same time, you want to stay focused. You don\u2019t want to look bad out there, you know?\u201d Carmelo Anthony, his teammate with the Knicks and an All-Star selection for the ninth time, said he had advised Porzingis to take a lot of photos. \u201cThis is a lot different from anything he\u2019s experienced,\u201d said Anthony, who, clad in a maroon blazer, was courtside for much of Porzingis\u2019s appearance in the Rising Stars Challenge. Anthony\u2019s experience here \u2014 well, it has been more complicated, a product of the Knicks\u2019 recent tailspin. Anthony has repeatedly dismissed trade rumors, and did so again Saturday. \u201cJust get tired of hearing something all the time,\u201d said Anthony, who has a no-trade clause in his contract and is dealing with a sore left knee. \u201cI\u2019m not on the run. I could\u2019ve ran somewhere when I was a free agent, you know what I\u2019m saying? I came back for a reason. I came back because I wanted to do this.\u201d Porzingis remains an unqualified source of optimism for the Knicks, although he has labored through some predictable growing pains this season \u2014 mostly the result of fatigue, he said. \u201cThere were a few moments when I wasn\u2019t playing that well and my energy wasn\u2019t that high,\u201d said Porzingis, who is averaging 13.9 points and 7.7 rebounds a game. He also said he felt some responsibility for the firing of Derek Fisher as coach last week, citing his up-and-down play \u2014 an unfair burden for a first-year player. \u201cI felt guilty for that happening,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cBut we have to move forward.\u201d On Saturday, Porzingis left for a short vacation with his family \u2014 somewhere warm, he said. He wanted to take advantage of an opportunity to rest and recover. He has a lot of work ahead of him. \u201cI just want to have a fresh mind,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially after this bad streak that we had at the end. I think that we all needed to disconnect a little bit.\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
