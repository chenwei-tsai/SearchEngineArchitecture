The players found two ways to express their feelings on Tuesday night, when Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin led a revival of Wagner\u2019s \u201cDer Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\u201d (\u201cThe Flying Dutchman\u201d), his first appearance since the announcement last June that he would succeed James Levine. When Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin appeared onstage for a curtain call, the players nearly pelted him with dozens of flowers, a gesture that caused him to smile with gratitude while ducking for cover. The more revealing expression of support, though, was the exciting performance the orchestra gave under this charismatic French Canadian conductor, who turned 42 last month. Though the playing abounded in youthful energy and dramatic sweep, other, deeper qualities distinguished the account of this early Wagner opera, first performed in Dresden in 1843. Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin drew both heaving intensity and diaphanous beauty from the music (here performed in the version with instrumental transitions between the acts, forming a continuous drama of some two hours and 20 minutes). Striving for absolute precision seemed not the driving concern. Now and then there were slightly shaky entrances, and little glitches of coordination between the chorus and the orchestra. This hardly mattered, for all the naturalness and immediacy of the playing. This was a sensual, inexorable account of the opera. The Met has assembled an excellent cast for Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin, especially the two leads. The German baritone Michael Volle brought a dark, muscular voice and chilling gravity to the title role, the mariner who, having provoked a satanic curse, must sail the stormy seas with a ghostly crew, permitted to make a single brief stop every seven years on a quest to be redeemed by a faithful woman. And the American soprano Amber Wagner, in her first appearance at the house in more than four years, gave a star-making performance as Senta, a strange young woman obsessed with the legend of the Dutchman and convinced that she can be his redeemer. Ms. Wagner took some time to warm up, and occasionally she seemed overly calculated in her singing. But her powerful, gleaming and richly expressive voice was ideal for the music. And in her most fraught, intense moments she was extraordinary. The singers seemed emboldened by the support they received from Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin, who said in an interview in the program that while \u201cThe Flying Dutchman\u201d was rooted in the Romantic tradition of Weber, the opera was \u201cextremely visionary\u201d as well. He explored both dimensions \u2014 the way Wagner looks both forward and back \u2014 but seemed especially concerned with making clear the score\u2019s debts to earlier opera, a refreshing approach. In the overture, the statement of the stirring theme associated with the Dutchman had an ominous cast, but also folkloric vigor. The subdued passage that explores the theme of redemption unfolded mysteriously. In the first scene, when Daland, Senta\u2019s father (the robust bass Franz-Josef Selig), orders the young Steersman (the fresh-voiced lyric tenor Ben Bliss) to stand watch while their ship is anchored some miles from home, the Steersman breaks into a jocular song. Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin guided Mr. Bliss in a performance that had the directness and intimacy of a Schubert lied. Yet as the sailor drifted to sleep, the conductor captured the ominous Wagnerian undertow in the orchestra. Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin boldly plumbed the music for wayward harmonic turns, mercurial shifts and weighty orchestral depths, as in the Dutchman\u2019s long, brooding monologue when we first meet him. In this 1989 production, originally directed by August Everding, which updates the story to the industrial age, the Dutchman\u2019s stage-filling ship resembles a massive black oil tanker. Mr. Volle\u2019s Dutchman slowly made his way down a steep exit ramp, stopping to express his anguished longing for salvation. Mr. Volle\u2019s voice, though not enormous, has the richness and heft to lift Wagner\u2019s tormented phrases. Only in his softer singing did his voice seem patchy. Taking the place of Jay Hunter Morris, who withdrew from the run for personal reasons, the clarion, sensitive tenor AJ Glueckert had a solid Met debut as Erik, the earnest huntsman who loves Senta. The veteran mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick was Mary, Senta\u2019s admonishing nurse. And the Met choristers were terrific, both the men in the sailors\u2019 songs and the women in the spinning room scene. The main news, though, was Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin\u2019s exceptional performance. Although he does not take charge full time until 2020 \u2014 a long wait \u2014 he has begun to talk about his plans for the Met, including commissioning new works, perhaps developed in collaboration with the Philadelphia Orchestra (where he is also music director), and occasionally getting the company out of Lincoln Center and into the communities of New York. All of this sounds encouraging, as was his terrific \u201cDutchman.\u201d", "title": "Review: Met Opera\u2019s Next Music Director Captains a Blazing \u2018Dutchman\u2019", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T17:06:56-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/music/review-mets-next-music-director-captains-a-blazing-dutchman.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00"}
