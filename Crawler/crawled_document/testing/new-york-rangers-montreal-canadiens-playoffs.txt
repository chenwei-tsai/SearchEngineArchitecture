In other cases, though, that moment unfolds in real time but projects its intent in slow motion, obvious even as it develops. The Rangers\u2019 2-1 victory Tuesday night against the Montreal Canadiens, which evened their best-of-seven series at two games apiece before the series returns to Montreal for Game 5 on Thursday, turned on a sequence in the second period that began with understated brilliance and ended, four seconds later, in unadulterated joy. Long before Henrik Lundqvist earned a rousing ovation for preserving a one-goal lead over the final 35 minutes 32 seconds, and long before the Rangers turned back a frantic Montreal push that included a rocket from Shea Weber that struck the goal post, Ryan McDonagh caught a puck with his hand. Hours earlier, standing in front of his locker, McDonagh said that there would be no continuation from the Rangers\u2019 listless Game 3 on Sunday. He distilled their charge Tuesday into simple terms. Just one play, he said, could prove critical. An uneven first period ended with the score tied at 1-1, but a few minutes into the second, the Rangers lingered in the Canadiens\u2019 zone, penetrating with a long shift. Relief almost came when Montreal defenseman Jeff Petry corralled the puck by the boards behind the goal line. All he had to do was flip the puck over McDonagh and past the blue line. But McDonagh hopped and snared the puck with his gloved left hand. As he set it on the ice, he tried to pass \u2014 but he missed, and the whiff helped him evade a check from Max Pacioretty. \u201cI got pretty lucky,\u201d McDonagh said. In an instant he regained possession and whipped a pass toward the crease, just looking for a stick blade. Stationed to the right of Montreal goalie Carey Price, Rick Nash received the puck on his forehand and in one fluid move transferred it to his backhand. With a gaping net, Nash put the Rangers ahead by 2-1 at 4:28. The collaboration invigorated the crowd at Madison Square Garden and fulfilled the wishes of Coach Alain Vigneault, who had publicly \u2014 and, no doubt, privately \u2014 challenged his stars. \u201cIn the playoffs,\u201d Nash said, \u201cyou need your best players to be your best players.\u201d Both Nash and McDonagh are stalwarts of Rangers teams that have reached the playoffs year after year, and both had watched as they sputtered at home in the playoffs \u2014 six straight losses, outscored by 21-4, since a Game 1 victory against Tampa Bay in the 2015 Eastern Conference finals. The most recent of those losses came Sunday night, and Vigneault, in discussing that defeat, used terms like \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d to describe his team\u2019s performance. \u201cIt was a tough couple days around here,\u201d Nash said. Speaking on Tuesday morning, Vigneault eschewed verbs like \u201cexpect\u201d and \u201chope\u201d for more definite language. The Rangers will play better, he said. Their power play, now 0 for 12 this series, will produce \u2014 of that he was \u201cvery confident.\u201d The first period demonstrated the challenge in transferring word to deed. For a spell the Rangers upheld Vigneault\u2019s initial pledge, if not in the quality of scoring opportunities then at least in their regular and dedicated presence in Montreal\u2019s zone. Buzzing around on the forecheck, Jesper Fast capitalized on a miscue by Andrei Markov \u2014 the puck, dumped in from center ice by Brady Skjei, caromed off his skates \u2014 to slip a backhander by Price at 11:39. But even as they led by 1-0, the Rangers still committed the sort of mistakes \u2014 unforced turnovers, defensive lapses \u2014 that doomed them in Game 3. Lundqvist, who finished with 23 saves, twice rescued them on breakaways, stopping Andrew Shaw and then Torrey Mitchell, before a poor line change late in the period rendered him helpless. Perfectly executing a two-on-one with Shea Weber, Mitchell shot into an open net to even the score at 1-1 at 18:37. Through the first three games, Lundqvist (.941) and Price (.944) had posted nearly identical save percentages. But Lundqvist had faced 29 more shots \u2014 the rough equivalent of a full game\u2019s worth \u2014 in an indictment of the Rangers\u2019 play in front of him. He has faced more consistent pressure than Price, who rarely makes mistakes. However, Price\u2019s tack on Nash\u2019s goal backfired when he failed to poke the puck away. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was there, to be honest,\u201d Price, who saved 30 of 32 shots, said of Nash. \u201cIt was a quick point shot. I didn\u2019t quite get set on the post the way I wanted to. I thought he was going to walk out front.\u201d Beyond their exceptional goaltending, what the Canadiens have in surplus \u2014 and what the Rangers have lacked \u2014 are players who agitate and infuriate. The Canadiens have nuisances like Brendan Gallagher, Shaw and Steve Ott, who in Game 3 felt like tousling Mats Zuccarello\u2019s hair during a stoppage, and so he did. \u201cThe game within the game,\u201d Ott said. To counter, Vigneault broke up the fourth line, the Rangers\u2019 most productive, by swapping brute force for skill. He replaced the team\u2019s chief pest, Tanner Glass, with the rookie wing Pavel Buchnevich. Vigneault wanted the Rangers to play with \u201ca quick pace.\u201d In the first period, they labored. In the third, aside from Lundqvist\u2019s sparkling play, they toiled. But in the second, they controlled play. The Rangers outshot the Canadiens by 12-6 and, courtesy of McDonagh and Nash, outscored them by 1-0, breaking one tie to achieve another.", "item_type": "Article"}
