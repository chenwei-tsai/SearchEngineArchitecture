{"text": "Myles Garrett, the consensus No. 1 pick in Thursday night\u2019s N.F.L. draft, is attracting lots of praise, of course. But increasingly, some pundits and players are raising questions too, making him a surprisingly divisive choice. Garrett, a defensive end from Texas A&M, is expected to be taken by the Cleveland Browns with the top pick. The case for him is easy to build. His athleticism is off the charts. He is a fearsome pass rusher and a ferocious tackler. His numbers at the predraft combine were sensational, including a sterling broad jump and bench press and a 4.64-second 40-yard dash. Most scouts rate him as a future All-Pro and a potential sacks leader. Encomiums to his skills are easy to find. \u201cUber-athlete with spring-loaded hips and elite explosiveness,\u201d said the NFL.com scouting report. \u201cHe possesses a rare (and ridiculous) combination of size, strength and athleticism,\u201d said Chris Burke of Sports Illustrated. \u201cHe\u2019s the best player in the draft and he can change your football team,\u201d his position coach at Texas A&M, Terry Price, told Cleveland.com. Anonymous scouts quoted throughout the news media often rave even more. But then there are the \u201cbuts.\u201d Is he not a big-play guy? The Hall of Famer Warren Sapp told ESPN: \u201cI\u2019m a pretty plain and frank guy, and I watch the tape and he disappears.\u201d \u201cI see a lazy kid that makes four plays a game. This is the No. 1 guy? No, no, no. This ain\u2019t even close.\u201d Is he durable and tough enough? He has never played more than 70 percent of defensive downs in his career, NFL.com reported. Are there injury issues? He missed two games this season and appeared limited in others because of an ankle sprain. Is his heart somewhere other than Cleveland? In February he suggested that the Dallas Cowboys trade up to draft him, annoying some in Cleveland, though the comments were later said to be a joke. It is always tempting to knock down the top dog. But this year\u2019s whispers seem to be more numerous and insidious than usual. Garrett does not plan to attend the draft, but instead will be with friends and family in Arlington, Tex. The answer to whether he goes No. 1 is coming Thursday night. The answer to whether he was a worthy choice will take a little longer.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/sports/football/myles-garrett-texas-am.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T08:23:45-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T07:00:03-04:00", "abstract": "Many scouts rate Myles Garrett as a future All-Pro, but there are people who question his durability and commitment.", "title": "Myles Garrett: Praise, and Disapproval, for the Projected No. 1 Pick"}
