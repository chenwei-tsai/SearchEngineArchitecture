{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Thursday he had agreed to pleas from the leaders of Canada and Mexico not to withdraw immediately from the North American Free Trade Agreement, but he warned he would still pull the United States out if he could not negotiate a better deal. \u201cI received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate Nafta rather than terminate,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter. \u201cI agreed\u2026\u201d Moments later, the president added, \u201c...subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA. Relationships are good \u2013 deal very possible!\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s posts showed once again his taste for high-stakes deal-making and his willingness to reverse himself. Only hours earlier, the president\u2019s aides put out word that he was likely to sign a directive starting a six-month clock to end the trade agreement. As a practical matter, it is not clear Mr. Trump\u2019s position has changed that much. During the 2016 campaign, he said he would seek to renegotiate Nafta, and pull out if he could not rework it to his satisfaction. That is essentially what he said on Twitter on Thursday morning. Still, in the phone calls with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \u2014 which came shortly after 6 p.m. on Wednesday \u2014 Mr. Trump stepped back from the brink of a trade war with two of America\u2019s biggest trading partners.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/trump-says-he-will-renegotiate-nafta-or-terminate-it.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T08:16:00-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T08:16:00-04:00", "abstract": "The president said on Twitter that he thought a deal was \u201cvery possible,\u201d only hours after his aides indicated he would move to end the trade agreement.", "title": "Trump Says He Will Renegotiate Nafta or Terminate It"}
