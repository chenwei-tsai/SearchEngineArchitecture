{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration\u2019s losing streak in courts around the nation has in large part been a product of precedents established by conservative judges in the Obama era. It turns out that legal principles meant to curb executive overreach are indifferent to the president\u2019s party. Republican officials had great success under President Barack Obama in persuading judges to block or complicate his efforts to expand health care, shield immigrants from deportation and protect transgender students. Now Democratic officials are using the principles established in those cases to frustrate President Trump\u2019s efforts to limit travel from predominantly Muslim countries and to punish so-called sanctuary cities. Both sides have shown remarkable dexterity in their understanding of the law, abruptly switching positions on issues like whether states have standing to sue, whether individual federal judges may issue nationwide injunctions and whether a federal threat to withhold funds can amount to a constitutional violation. Josh Blackman, a law professor at South Texas College of Law, said Democratic officials should strive for more consistency, even if only as a matter of self-interest. \u201cWhatever California can do to resist immigration law,\u201d Professor Blackman said, \u201cTexas can do to resist environmental laws.\u201d Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, made a similar point from the opposite direction about Tuesday\u2019s decision blocking efforts to withhold federal money from sanctuary cities. \u201cSome conservative Republicans may not like the outcome of this specific case,\u201d he wrote on The Volokh Conspiracy, a legal blog. \u201cBut they will have reason to celebrate it the next time a liberal Democratic president tries a similar move.\u201d In Tuesday\u2019s decision, Judge William H. Orrick of Federal District Court in San Francisco relied on a 2012 Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. That ruling, which added major complications to the rollout of the health care law, was popular with conservatives. The decision, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, was best known for sustaining a central provision of the law, its individual mandate. But the court also ruled that Congress may not impose significant new conditions on existing federal funding, a position pressed by states led by Republicans. When the case was argued, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year, highlighted the political realities of the opposition to the Medicaid expansion. \u201cIs there any chance that all 26 states opposing it have Republican governors, and all of the states supporting it have Democratic governors?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s a correlation, Justice Scalia,\u201d said Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for the states challenging the law, to laughter. In Tuesday\u2019s ruling, in a case brought by two California counties, Judge Orrick said the principle established in 2012 applied to the Trump administration\u2019s threat to withhold federal money from localities that refuse to aid efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. \u201cThe Supreme Court concluded that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s threat of denying Medicaid funds, which constituted over 10 percent of the state\u2019s overall budget, was unconstitutionally coercive and represented a \u2018gun to the head,\u2019\u201d Judge Orrick wrote. \u201cThe executive order threatens to deny sanctuary jurisdictions all federal grants, hundreds of millions of dollars on which the counties rely. The threat is unconstitutionally coercive.\u201d Mr. Trump pledged to appeal Judge Orrick\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court, which this month regained a conservative majority with his appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. \u201cFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cSee you in the Supreme Court!\u201d (The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has not ruled in the sanctuary cities case, though it did affirm a ruling blocking Mr. Trump\u2019s first travel ban. Judge Orrick is a district court judge whose decisions may be appealed to the Ninth Circuit.) Though only two counties had challenged the sanctuary-cities order, Judge Orrick issued a nationwide injunction temporarily blocking it. Here, too, he took a page from what was until recently a Republican litigation playbook. In cases concerning Mr. Obama\u2019s initiatives on immigration and transgender rights, individual judges in Texas concluded that nationwide injunctions blocking them were warranted. Republicans embraced those rulings. Now they are less certain that individual federal judges should be able to wield such power. \u201cOnce again, a single district judge \u2014 this time in San Francisco \u2014 has ignored federal immigration law to set a new immigration policy for the entire country,\u201d in a statement released Tuesday. Mr. Trump\u2019s first travel ban was also put halted by a nationwide injunction, entered by a judge in Seattle, and his revised travel ban was blocked by nationwide injunctions from judges in Maryland and Hawaii. That last order did not sit well with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who criticized Judge Derrick K. Watson of Federal District Court in Honolulu \u2013 \u201ca judge sitting on an island in the Pacific,\u201d as Mr. Sessions put it \u2013 for issuing a ruling that would apply to the whole nation. But Judge Watson relied on a 2015 appeals court ruling blocking Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration program that said such nationwide injunctions were required to ensure uniformity. The appeals court affirmed an injunction issued by a single judge in Brownsville, Tex., who said Mr. Obama had exceeded his authority. As a senator, Mr. Sessions cheered that ruling, saying it was \u201can injunction that stopped the Obama administration from proceeding with its lawless immigration system.\u201d Both sides have been flexible in their understanding of the applicable legal principles, Professor Blackman said. \u201cWith respect to nationwide injunctions,\u201d he said, \u201cblue state attorney generals are relying on arguments they expressly opposed during the Obama administration.\u201d It is time to embrace neutral legal principles, Professor Somin said, whether they help one side or the other in any given case. That would, he said, \u201chelp tamp down the dangerous partisan conflict and hatred that are poisoning our political system.\u201d Neil S. Siegel, a law professor at Duke, said the Supreme Court and the public should think hard about the recent whiplash-inducing litigation turnabouts. \u201cA question we will eventually want to ask the justices is a question we should also be asking ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWho is prepared to be at all principled about these matters?\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/trump-legal-defeats.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T13:28:28-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News Analysis", "created_date": "2017-04-27T13:28:28-04:00", "abstract": "Legal rulings cheered by Republicans when they set back the Obama administration are now causing some grief for the current White House occupant.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Losing Streak in Courts Traceable to Conservative Judges"}
