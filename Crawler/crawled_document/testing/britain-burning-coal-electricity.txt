{"text": "LONDON \u2014 If all goes according to plan, Friday will be the first full day since the height of the Industrial Revolution that Britain will not burn coal to generate electricity, a development that officials and climate change activists were already celebrating as a watershed moment. The accomplishment will not become official until just before 11 p.m., when the 24-hour period ends, but executives in the National Grid control room said on Twitter that they expected it to be achieved: \u201cIt looks likely that today will be the first ever working day in Britain without #coal since the industrial revolution!\u201d Coal powered Britain into the industrial age and into the 21st century, contributing greatly to the \u201cpea souper\u201d fogs that were thought for decades to be a natural phenomenon of the British climate. For many living in the mining towns up and down the country, it was not just the backbone of the economy but a way of life. But the industry has been in decline for some time. The last deep coal mine closed in December 2015, though open cast mining has continued. Coal-fired power generation contributes heavily to climate change; burning coal produces twice as much carbon dioxide as burning natural gas. Reducing the world\u2019s reliance on coal and increasing the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have long been part of proposals to prevent the worst consequences of climate change. Now on a path to phase out coal-fired power generation altogether by 2025, Britain, also the home of the first steam engine, is currently closing coal plants and stepping up generation from cleaner natural gas and renewables, like wind and solar. \u201cSymbolically, this is a milestone,\u201d said Sean Kemp, a spokesman for National Grid, Britain\u2019s power grid operator. \u201cA kind of end of an era.\u201d The first public coal-fired generator opened at Holborn Viaduct in London in 1882. Since then, the British economy, one of Europe\u2019s largest, is thought never to have gone without power from coal for a whole working day. There have been shorter coal-free periods before. Last May, coal generation dropped to zero for the first time, but only for a few hours at a time. On a weekend later that month, National Grid achieved a coal-free stretch of 19 hours, the longest at the time, Mr. Kemp said. Demand for electricity tends to be lower in the spring, when homes and offices turn off their heating and normally do not yet have a need for air-conditioning. It tends to be particularly low on a Friday and during the Easter holiday period. But the trend away from coal as a source of electricity is structural, officials say, with coal-free days likely to become more common. Since 2012, two-thirds of Britain\u2019s coal-fired power generating capacity has been shuttered. Some plants have been converted partially to burn biomass, such as wood pellets. Last year, the share of coal in total power generation dropped to 9 percent, down from 23 percent in 2015 and 40 percent in 2012. Some countries have already left coal behind in power generation. In Switzerland, Belgium and Norway, \u201cevery day is a coal-free day,\u201d Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Alvarez, a coal analyst at the International Energy Agency in Paris, pointed out. In the United States, where coal still accounts for about 30 percent of power generation, Vermont and Idaho are the only coal-free states, and California is close behind, he said. Coal is still used in heavy industry like steel and cement production. But given how important coal was in Britain\u2019s history, Mr. Alvarez described the news on Friday as more evidence of a trend toward \u201clow-carbon electricity.\u201d \u201cThe first day without coal in Britain since the Industrial Revolution marks a watershed in the energy transition,\u201d Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace U.K., told The Guardian. \u201cThe direction of travel is that both in the U.K. and globally we are already moving towards a low carbon economy.\u201d Meanwhile, in the London Museum of Water & Steam, which has a heritage collection of coal-fired steam engines and railway engines, the operations manager, Edward Fagan, was planning for a future exhibition. \u201cCoal-fired power generation is very fast becoming a heritage item,\u201d Mr. Fagan said. \u201cOne day we\u2019ll have to add a power station to our collection.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/europe/britain-burning-coal-electricity.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T15:31:36-04:00", "abstract": "For the first time since the industrial revolution, Britain expects to go 24 hours without using coal to generate electricity, and expects to end all such use by 2025.", "title": "Britain Poised to Go Full Day Without Burning Coal for Electricity", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "World", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T15:31:36-04:00"}
