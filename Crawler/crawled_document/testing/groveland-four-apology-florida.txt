{"text": "More than a half-century after a violent, dramatic criminal case in central Florida earned national attention, the State Senate passed a resolution Thursday apologizing to the families of four black men who were \u201cvictims of racial hatred\u201d and \u201cgross injustices\u201d during the era of state-sanctioned segregation in the American South. The so-called Groveland Four \u2014 Charles Greenlee, Ernest Thomas, Walter Irvin and Samuel Shepherd \u2014 were accused of raping a white woman in 1949 near the city of Groveland in Lake County, Fla. One was killed within days. Three were beaten in custody and convicted. Of those, one was shot dead on his way to a retrial. They are all dead now. The resolution, which earlier passed the Florida House, extended a \u201cheartfelt apology\u201d for their mistreatment and wrongful convictions, and urged Gov. Rick Scott to grant them full pardons. \u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that the governor and his cabinet will appreciate the message that\u2019s being sent,\u201d said Gary Farmer, a Democrat in the Senate who sponsored the bill along with Bobby DuBose, a Democrat in the House. \u201cIt\u2019s bipartisan, and there\u2019s really no question about these men\u2019s innocence.\u201d The resolution relays the reported facts of the case in excruciating detail: By the end of the night, law enforcement had arrested three young men \u2014 Mr. Irvin, Mr. Greenlee and Mr. Shepherd \u2014 who would be severely beaten by the authorities. Mr. Thomas, meanwhile, \u201cunderstanding the racial realities of the time and the danger he was in,\u201d had fled the county, the resolution said. A posse of about 1,000 men tracked him down days later in nearby swamps, where he died \u201cin a hail of gunfire.\u201d N.A.A.C.P. lawyers, including Franklin Williams and Thurgood Marshall, took an active role in the men\u2019s defense. It was clear to them that at least two, Mr. Greenlee and Mr. Thomas, were never at the scene of the alleged crime; that the beatings had led to forced confessions; and important evidence, including a medical examination of the woman, was never presented in court. An all-white jury sentenced Mr. Irvin and Mr. Shepherd to death, and Mr. Greenlee to life in prison. Mr. Williams and Mr. Marshall appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, where the convictions were unanimously overturned in 1951. But the story was far from over. One photograph, in particular, has come to represent the tragic history of the Groveland Four. It shows two black men lying in the grass, in the background and out of focus. In the foreground stands Willis V. McCall, the sheriff of Lake County, looking disheveled in the harsh light of a camera\u2019s flash. The two men on the ground were Mr. Shepherd and Mr. Irvin. They were due for a retrial. Sheriff McCall had been personally driving the men to appear in court in Tavares when he stopped the car. Shots were fired. The sheriff would claim that he had stopped to fix a flat tire, that the two men had tried to attack him, and that he had shot them in self-defense. Mr. Irvin survived. From a hospital bed, he told investigators that after the sheriff shot him twice, another official, Deputy Sheriff James L. Yates shot him again in the neck, at point-blank range, while he lay on the ground. He recovered and eventually was retried, only to be convicted and sentenced to death again, by another all-white jury. The sheriff who shot him was re-elected five more times. For decades, family members of the men kept largely quiet about the case. Vivian Shepherd, Samuel Shepherd\u2019s niece, said she couldn\u2019t understand the sense of shame that permeated her life. \u201cI used to feel a certain way growing up. It\u2019s like embarrassment,\u201d she said. The details of the case, she said, only began to come clear after the publication of book by a man she\u2019d never met, Gary Corsair. In 1999, Mr. Corsair was searching through newspaper clippings when he saw a 1949 report about the case. He spent the next several years researching a book he self-published in 2004: \u201cLegal Lynching: The Saga of the Groveland Four.\u201d Ms. Shepherd said that book helped her understand that her father and her grandparents \u2014 whose home was destroyed by angry mobs reacting to the rape allegations in 1949 \u2014 had suffered more than she ever realized. \u201cThey lost a brother, a son; they lost their house, their land and everything,\u201d she said. Later, another writer, Gilbert King, came across some of Mr. Marshall\u2019s letters about the Groveland Four. \u201cI remember reading these letters thinking, \u2018What is going on in this case?\u2019 It sounded horrible. It just seemed so dramatic,\u201d he said. Mr. King spent years chasing down leads. His work culminated in a 2012 book, \u201cDevil in the Grove,\u201d which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2013. That really set the legislative gears turning. Geraldine Thompson, a former state senator, said she handed out 40 copies of \u201cDevil in the Grove\u201d to fellow lawmakers. Ms. Thompson led the charge to pass a formal apology, but she left the senate in 2016. She attributed the difficulty to normal procedural issues, but said rewriting history is always a difficult undertaking. \u201cWhenever these kinds of things happen, there\u2019s a lot of denial and people who just refuse to believe it,\u201d she said. In 1955, Mr. Irvin\u2019s death sentence was commuted to life in prison. He was released on parole in 1968, and died a year later. Mr. Greenlee was released on parole in 1960. He went on to live a quiet life and rarely discussed the case, said Mr. Corsair, who met him before his death in 2012. \u201cI asked him why he didn\u2019t hate, why he didn\u2019t want vindication,\u201d he said. \u201cHe told me that would have made him just like the people who lied on him.\u201d Ms. Shepherd said she is happy about the legislative apology but unsure whether Gov. Scott will grant a pardon. (In an email, the governor\u2019s office said only that it would \u201clook at any resolution passed by the legislature.\u201d) \u201cHe\u2019s just a hard one. I\u2019m going to be thankful if he passes the bill, and I\u2019m going to make sure I don\u2019t upset him before we get the bill signed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry that it has taken so long.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/groveland-four-apology-florida.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T15:07:01-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T15:04:44-04:00", "abstract": "The so-called Groveland Four were convicted of raping a white woman in 1949.
