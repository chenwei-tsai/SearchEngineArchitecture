As a millennial, I\u2019m surrounded by folks who\u2019d rather see what friends halfway across the world are having for lunch than interact with the people in their presence. Every second is used checking the latest updates. As a student, I avoid using my laptop to take notes, as somehow the front page of The New York Times ends up being more exciting than the lecture I\u2019m hearing. This is the new normal, and it\u2019s not healthy. We need time to reflect, think and speak with the people from all walks of life we run into. Call me a Luddite, but I think that many aspects of life were better before we had computers in our pockets. Mr. Leonhardt\u2019s suggestion to unplug and disconnect whenever possible is one we\u2019d all do well to heed. DANIEL S.
