{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "PALM DESERT, Calif. \u2014 It was Jingle Mingle Night at the Marrakesh Country Club. Inside its serpentine pink walls, past the entry gazebo\u2019s cone roof, up the drive flanked by petunia beds and olive trees clipped like standard poodles, a line of cars disgorged guests swathed in Santa suits and stocking caps and sweaters with blinking LED lights. Inside the clubhouse, waiters in red and green argyle took drink orders, and a couple dozen couples of a certain age grooved to Wild Cherry\u2019s \u201cPlay that Funky Music.\u201d But note the table by the dance floor, the one filled with (relatively) young men in sober (by comparison) dark blazers. If their youth and their attire weren\u2019t conspicuous enough, there was the matter of their conversation. Sawing into a slab of prime rib, Stephen Drucker, the former editor of several lifestyle publications, announced that he had just spruced up the portico of his Marrakesh villa with a pair of white canvas drapes \u2014 an Old Hollywood touch, he said, that reminded him of \u201cthose birthday parties where \u2018Uncle\u2019 Gary Cooper would take little Christina Crawford for a pony ride.\u201d \u201cExactly the kind of thing I\u2019m excited the committee is making provisions for,\u201d said Steven Price, an architecture historian who wears his silver hair in a bob, referring to the club\u2019s Architecture and Landscape Committee. Patrick Dragonette, a modern furniture dealer from Los Angeles, concurred. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the house with the pushed-out columns,\u201d he said, his undertone the verbal equivalent of a raised eyebrow. \u201cNobody is happy about it.\u201d For 45 years, give or take, the main draw of this private residential community, which sits in the bowl formed by the San Jacinto Mountains and the Santa Rosa Mountains, was its 18-hole executive golf course. But these days it\u2019s as much a mecca for worshipers of high design as it is a destination for those who pray for eagles and birdies. Their god: the architect John Elgin Woolf, who created Marrakesh\u2019s 364 pink and white villas and 14 pink and white pool houses in his signature Hollywood Regency style. \u201cThe desert used to be driven by golf,\u201d Mr. Drucker said. \u201cNow the big engine of the economy in the desert, certainly Palm Springs, is style. You can\u2019t buy architecture of this quality, at this price, in Palm Springs.\u201d The glassy, low-slung constructions of Palm Springs and other nearby desert communities have hardly ebbed in popularity, as a recent upswing in short-term rentals there demonstrates. But butterfly roofs and concrete cutout walls aren\u2019t for everyone. In addition to Messrs. Drucker, Dragonette and Price, those who have instead embraced the mansard roofs and pink stucco walls of Marrakesh include the home furnishings magnate Annie Selke (Pine Cone Hill, Dash & Albert), the New York designer Joe D\u2019Urso, the Los Angeles designer and architect Tim Morrison, and Susie Coelho, a former HGTV host and a former wife of Sonny Bono, who before being elected to Congress served as mayor of Palm Springs. In 1967, when Mr. Bono was still married to Cher, an amateur golfer and golf course architect named Johnny Dawson (he also developed Thunderbird Country Club in Rancho Mirage and Eldorado Country Club in Indian Wells) leased 155 acres in Palm Desert and, inspired by the property\u2019s similarities to the Atlas Mountains-ringed city of Marrakesh, conceived of a new club with a Moroccan theme. The community\u2019s salmon-pink palette was suggested by the rosy sandstone walls, and its hilltop clubhouse, introduced by a Middle Eastern-style water stair, was placed to overlook the villas like a casbah surveying so many riads. After that, the Moroccan trope kind of trails off. That is because John Woolf, hired to design the club in 1968, had a vernacular all his own. Mr. Woolf had come to Los Angeles from Atlanta to become an actor \u2014 he hoped his Southern roots would help land him a role in \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d But he had also studied architecture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and when the acting career fizzled, he leveraged his Hollywood ties to become an architect to the stars. Eventually known as Hollywood Regency, Mr. Woolf\u2019s trademark style blended English Regency and French Regency with movie-set glamour and modernist restraint. His houses offered elegant scale and symmetry, dramatic entrances (often a pair of tall Pullman doors puncturing a mansard roof) and perfectly proportioned rooms punctuated by neoclassical columns and elliptical windows. This muted opulence appealed to Hollywood nobility like Greta Garbo, Judy Garland, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. \u201cThey were very theatrical, but understandable\u201d to people in the entertainment industry, said Mr. Price, who is writing a book about the architect and who conveys his own air of drama with Peggy Guggenheim sunglasses and a Lagerfeldian fan. In recent years Mr. Woolf\u2019s reputation has resurged. The producer Robert Evans\u2019s book \u201cThe Kid Stays in the Picture\u201d (and the film based on it) and a biography and a play about the Hollywood agent Sue Mengers brought attention to their Woolf-designed lairs in Beverly Hills. And a Vanity Fair profile of Mr. Woolf shed light on his unorthodox personal life: For business purposes, the architect adopted his lover and professional partner, Robert Koch Woolf, as well as Mr. Koch\u2019s boyfriend, Gene Oney Woolf. Together they were known as the Woolf Pack. In the Los Angeles real-estate market, Woolf houses are considered trophies. Recent owners of the designer\u2019s homes include the producer John Goldwyn and his husband, the hotelier Jeff Klein; the designer Nate Berkus and the night life impresario Sean MacPherson. Last fall, Jill Tavelman Collins (the former wife of Phil Collins, mother of Lilly) bought a Woolf house in Beverly Hills for $12.5 million, 40 percent over the asking price. The one-, two- and three-bedroom duplex villas at Marrakesh, while more modest in both scale and price \u2014 units can still be had for under $400,000 \u2014 do not stint on Woolfian drama. They all have deep courtyards, tiered mansard roofs and tall, skinny front doors that make anyone passing through them feel like Loretta Young (who had a Woolf house). Inside there are 10-foot ceilings, closets the size of bedrooms and airy atriums off the master baths. \u201cThe kitchens were clearly designed for some sort of staff person to slip in every day through a side door,\u201d Mr. Drucker said. \u201cPrepare the chicken salad, read a magazine on a little stepladder and then come serve the ladies in the corner of the living room designed for bridge parties.\u201d Originally marketed to the local gentry (specifically members of the Los Angeles Country Club) as well as snowbirds from Canada and Chicago, Marrakesh memberships offered a slice of the good life early-1970s-style. Picture a Cadillac or a Lincoln, a station wagon and a golf cart in every oversize garage. The promise of that era is enshrined at a bougainvillea-draped condo between the eighth green and the ninth tee. The unit, which Ann Judy, a Santa Ynez Valley resident, inherited from her parents, has remained virtually untouched since it was first decorated over four decades ago. Its original color scheme of white and lime green extends from a white shag rug and floral print drapes to white and green dishes to a Zenith television encased in white lacquer trimmed with the drapery fabric. You can almost hear Karen Carpenter singing \u201cClose to You.\u201d \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it?\u201d Ms. Judy said. \u201cIt\u2019s light, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s fun. And unique.\u201d One could argue that, despite the consistency of their exteriors, every residence at Marrakesh is unique. \u201cWoolf designed these clean Hollywood Regency shells that gave every owner the ability to adapt them,\u201d Mr. Dragonette said. He and his partner, Charles Tucker, share a two-bedroom villa that they call Orchid House, after the Tiffany diamond brooch whose sale financed its purchase. After slightly reconfiguring the rooms, the couple added Italian porcelain floors and patent leather wallpaper. Coveted furniture designs by Billy Haines and John Dickinson are well represented here, but the showstopper is a huge canvas from Mike Cockrill\u2019s \u201cBaby Doll/Clown Killer\u201d series depicting three little girls torturing a clown. In his home, Mr. Drucker channeled \u201cRobsjohn-Gibbings in Athens,\u201d he said, referring to the historicist designer\u2019s apartment overlooking the Acropolis. His soft voice echoed off his bare white terrazzo floors and largely unadorned pale walls (Benjamin Moore \u201cSimply White\u201d) as he identified pieces in his living room: a Billy Baldwin sofa and slipper chairs, a circa 1960 Klismos outdoor dining set, a pair of urn-topped white columns flanking the front door like something out of the Elizabeth Arden salon. All in the spirit, he noted, of \u201cthat early \u201960s Lincoln Center-\u2018Valley of the Dolls\u2019 Neo-Classicism.\u201d His friend Ms. Selke, who recently completed a redo of her place next door, said: \u201cSteven\u2019s is this white gleaming palace. I\u2019m going for a really sassy riad look.\u201d Taking her cue from Shangri La, the tobacco heiress Doris Duke\u2019s Moroccan-themed outpost in Hawaii, she draped her living area with a paisley fabric in Yves Klein blue, wrapped the fireplace in mirror and hung massive Moroccan lanterns. The project inspired her latest furnishings line, the \u201cPalm Springs Collection.\u201d Rod Youngson, an architect who knew the Woolf Pack (as well as Loretta Young and her daughter) and his partner, Bill Ruegge, a real estate agent and building contractor (and perhaps most usefully, as far as their business is concerned, a golf pro), have redone eight houses in Marrakesh between them. \u201cThey\u2019re just built so much better than anything else on the market,\u201d said Mr. Youngson, who likes to \u201cfreshen\u201d the condominiums by removing interior walls and putting in floor-to-ceiling doors. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a different kind of clientele since we\u2019ve gone \u2018fee land,\u2019\u201d he added. Until recently the club leased the property it sits on from a private owner, but in fall 2015, it bought the land. Since then, property values have surged \u2014 as have the ambitions of local remodelers. Marrakesh residents have lately been erecting high hedges against their neighbors, installing swimming pools in their courtyards and turning their atriums into outdoor showers. \u201cEveryone wants to be Walter Annenberg in Bungalow Five,\u201d said Mr. Price, brandishing his fan. Mr. Dragonette regularly takes his golf cart out to survey the changes. Usually he conducts his reconnaissance under the cover of night, but he was persuaded to take a visitor for a tour on a recent balmy afternoon. (Notwithstanding the names of its streets \u2014 Kasbah Drive, Minzah Way \u2014 Marrakesh can sometimes evoke Morocco less than the Caribbean, with its pastel buildings, mint-green fairways and swaying palms). He braked his Western 100 in front of a villa with a half-demolished back patio. \u201cThis guy is getting that all terraced out for himself,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen is he\u2019ll be assessed. As a committee member, you can\u2019t say someone can\u2019t have something just because it\u2019s ugly.\u201d Like most small communities, Marrakesh is not immune to controversy. Usually the disputes involve aesthetics rather than, say, geopolitics. (Mr. Youngson would be happy to see the club change its calling-card peach complexion for a tamer beige or taupe.) Not always, though. According to Mr. Price and other members, golf course chatter about \u201ctoo many Modernism Week activities\u201d or \u201cthe Palm Springs problem\u201d is code for too many gays.  But such tensions are the exception in this pink Brigadoon. It\u2019s hard to walk or drive down Kasbah Drive or Minzah Way without being waved at, repeatedly. \u201cThe common pull of the design makes everybody mix well,\u201d said Daniel Nelms, a single father of two young boys who moved to Marrakesh from Los Angeles a year and a half ago. \u201cOne of my sons spent all spring in the pool playing Barbies with our 70-year-old neighbor. I wish I\u2019d had that growing up.\u201d Mr. Price put it this way: \u201cMarrakesh self-selects. How seriously can you take yourself when you live in a pink house?\u201d As he spoke, his partner, Jeffrey Roberts, motioned from the couple\u2019s terrace overlooking the golf course: \u201cThe color\u2019s getting really good now!\u201d he shouted. Outside the winter sun was sinking toward the stately San Jacintos, casting a rich glow across the valley below. The effect, much like the play of light in the fabled Moroccan city, was dazzling. Or as Ann Judy\u2019s father used to say, \u201cWelcome to another damn day in paradise.\u201d", "title": "California\u2019s Marrakesh: A Country Club That\u2019s Chic Again", "abstract": "\u201cHow seriously can you take yourself when you live in a pink house?\u201d said one resident of a desert complex where time stands still and hair doesn\u2019t frizz.", "section": "Fashion & Style", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-26T13:35:55-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/fashion/palm-springs-marrakesh-california.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T14:15:03-04:00"}
