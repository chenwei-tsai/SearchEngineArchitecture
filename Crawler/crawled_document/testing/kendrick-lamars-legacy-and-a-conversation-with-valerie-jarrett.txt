We think so. His fourth studio album, \u201cDAMN.,\u201d is already expected to garner more than 200 million streams online \u2014 cementing his place as one of the biggest recording artists. \u201cDAMN.\u201d is a remarkable feat for Mr. Lamar, who pushes past the club anthems of his last album to expose his deepest vulnerabilities while continuing to stun us with his lyrical virtuosity. We do a deep-dive analysis of one of our favorite tracks, \u201cXXX,\u201d which features the rock band U2, and discuss why we think this song reflects the emotional angst of the album. It\u2019s Mr. Lamar\u2019s breakup with America in the post-Trump era. Then, we make a \u201cStill Processing\u201d dream come true by interviewing Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Barack Obama for all eight years of his presidency, who injects us with her relentless optimism about the future of democracy and the promise of civic participation. We go from breakups to make-ups, with a special dedication at the end. From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.
