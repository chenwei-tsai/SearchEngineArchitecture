They Imagined How It Would Work.", "material_type_facet": "News", "text": "During his presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump promised to build \u201ca big, beautiful, powerful wall\u201d  between the United States and Mexico, ostensibly to keep out assorted \u201cbad hombres.\u201d Though a deadline for bids has passed and finalists are to be announced in June, the projected cost \u2014 an estimated  $21.6 billion \u2014 and political opposition mean there\u2019s a decent chance the wall will not be built soon. Even so, President Trump\u2019s pronouncements have inspired a boom in border projects of a very different sort: documentaries, shorts, cartoons and art installations about the contested area, where barriers and fences already exist along some stretches. In several of these, Mr. Trump is unseen and unheard. In others, he\u2019s front and center, overseeing construction of a Berlin Wall-type edifice (\u201cBuild That Wall\u201d), or killing Mexicans with missiles fired from his genitals (\u201cM.A.M.O.N.\u201d). Regardless of how large or small Mr. Trump looms in their works, some filmmakers were hesitant to talk about him out of fear of retaliation. One mentioned his own green-card status; another didn\u2019t want to jeopardize future plans to visit the United States. Here is a roundup of some of the best and most notable projects of the bunch: \u2018THROUGH THE REPELLENT FENCE\u2019 (2017) The director Sam Wainwright Douglas chronicles the planning and deployment of \u201cRepellent Fence,\u201d a two-mile-long art installation from the collective Postcommodity that straddled the border for four days in 2015. Eight years in the making, the work employed a line of 28 hot-air balloons decorated with enormous eyes (modeled after similar, smaller devices used to scare birds away from fruit trees) to create a \u201cmetaphorical suture\u201d between the countries and their people. \u2018LA FRONTERA\u2019 (2016) A forestry expert, Mark J. Hainds quit his job at Auburn University in 2014 to walk the length of the Texas-Mexico line, over 1,000 miles in all. Along the way, he met border patrol agents, goat ranchers, cowboys and drug smugglers \u2014 nearly all of whom criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to beef up the region\u2019s existing wall. Find out more about the film here. \u2018EL MAR LA MAR\u2019 (2017) Over three years, Joshua Bonnetta and J. P. Sniadecki traveled the Sonoran desert, which covers parts of California, Arizona and Mexico, filming its desolate landscapes and speaking with residents and migrants about their experiences in this foreboding territory. In one scene, a woman describes how she found a female body in the middle of the desert, collapsed mid-crawl; in another, two men recall being lost in the hills for eight days and explain how some of their party members were left behind when they could no longer walk. \u201cEl Mar\u201d is more art film than traditional documentary, with images of gathering storms, migrant detritus, swarms of ants and eerie fields of razor-sharp cactuses. For people unfamiliar with the area, the place \u2014 like the metaphorical sea of its title \u2014 can be a deadly crossing zone. \u201cWe basically funnel people through that area,\u201d Mr. Sniadecki said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve outsourced the violence to the ecological landscape.\u201d Read a review of the film here. \u2018BEST OF LUCK WITH THE WALL\u2019 (2016) The director Josh Begley pasted together 200,000 satellite images taken along the United States-Mexico border to create this six-minute short. The result is a high-speed flyover of the 2,000-mile stretch; the snarky title comes from the challenges of building a wall along a border that traverses deserts, wetlands, rivers and mountainous terrain. \u2018AMERICA\u2019S SOCCER MIGRANTS\u2019 (2017) This Guardian documentary opens with Mr. Trump\u2019s quote about Mexico \u201cnot sending their best,\u201d then proceeds to tell the story of American soccer players heading in the opposite direction, lured across the border for better money and a higher level of play. Mexico\u2019s love for the game is contrasted with Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric; in one sequence, thoughtful citizens of both countries respond to his promises and name-calling, point by point. See the short here. \u2018THINK LIKE A SCIENTIST: BOUNDARIES\u2019 (2016) What happens when you stick long stretches of steel walls \u2014 at some points, more than 21 feet high \u2014 in the middle of a desert ecosystem? Wildlife migration patterns are disrupted, plant diversity diminishes, animals \u2014 dependent on border crossing to reach food, water and mates \u2014 die. In this short, the conservation photographer Krista Schlyer and the biologist Jon Beckmann discuss how the Department of Homeland Security waived environmental laws in its rush to secure the southern border. The effect has been disastrous for flora and fauna: Sonoran desert toads, in search of water, butt up against border walls until they die; plants that depend on animals to spread their seeds can\u2019t migrate. And if Mr. Trump\u2019s wall is built? \u201cI think the first thing that would happen is that jaguars would go extinct in the U.S.,\u201d Ms. Schlyer said in an interview. \u201cI think that would happen very quickly.\u201d See the short here. \u2018THE WALL\u2019 (2017) Motivated by the Syrian refugee crisis and Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, the Australian directors Nick Baker and Tristan Klein created this haunting fable about a grandmother and grandson \u201cin a far, foreign place\u201d who flee their country after watching their home burn to the ground. The two endure war and a dangerous sea crossing \u2014 only to find their path to sanctuary blocked by a \u201ctall, endless wall.\u201d \u2018M.A.M.O.N.\u2019 (2016) In this effects-heavy spectacle from the Argentine filmmaker Ale Damiani, Latino doctors, beauty queens and grill cooks are catapulted across the border by the United States. A giant robot piloted by Mr. Trump \u2014 and looking quite a bit like him \u2014 attacks them, leading to fights with a mariachi, a cowardly diplomat, the Virgin Mary (sort of) and a chicken. See the short here. \u2018BUILD THAT WALL\u2019 (2016) A man goes to sleep and dreams that Mr. Trump has built an enormous wall splitting his town in half, complete with barbed wire, guards and checkpoints. Thankfully, the dream is just that, and the man awakens to find his town undivided. To create this stop-motion short, the Australian director Gary Friedman wove together elements from a black-and-white documentary about the Berlin Wall, Mr. Trump\u2019s own speeches (\u201cif they call it the Trump wall, it has to be beautiful\u201d) and a classic 1960 \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d episode about the dangers of Cold War paranoia (\u201cThe Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\u201d). A puppeteer by trade, Mr. Friedman performed an anti-apartheid puppet show on the streets of South Africa from 1981 to 1987. \u201cI used to get beaten up regularly,\u201d he said. As for his latest project, he never figured when he was making the film last year in his Melbourne studio that Mr. Trump might win. \u201cIt was supposed to be a dream, a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to actually come true.\u201d See the short here. \u2018ONE-WAY MIRROR\u2019 (DENVER ART MUSEUM, THROUGH OCT. 22) In this work by the Denver-based artist Jaime Carrejo, a 10-foot scrim splits the gallery in two. Images of a Mexican sunrise are projected on one wall, an American sunset on the other; during rare moments, images from both sides of the border meld and collide in the middle. Find out more about the exhibition here. \u2018BORDER CANTOS\u2019 (CRYSTAL BRIDGES MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART, BENTONVILLE, ARK., THROUGH MONDAY, APRIL 24) A collaboration of the photographer Richard Misrach and the composer Guillermo Galindo, \u201cBorder Cantos\u201d documents the human effects of the walls in place now by examining the objects immigrants leave behind. Mr. Misrach captures images of castoff clothes and toys; Mr. Galindo creates musical instruments out of the jetsam, composing scores for them to accompany Mr. Misrach\u2019s immense photos. Find out more about the exhibition here. \u2018A VERY LONG LINE\u2019 (Whitney Biennial 2017, through June 11) The collective Postcommodity (Raven Chacon, Cristob\u00e1l Mart\u00ednez and Kade L. Twist) placed a cameraman on the hood of its car and filmed while driving along the border. In the gallery installation, viewers are surrounded by four immense screens on which images are projected at varying speeds, as fences and homes rush by. The title is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the art world\u2019s pretentious titles, while also, Mr. Twist said, a pretty decent description of the border wall itself. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the first things that pop into your mind,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018That is a very, very long line.\u2019\u201d The filmmakers were also intrigued by the patchwork nature of the border barriers \u2014 impenetrable in some areas, simple pylons in others. The filmmakers shot from the American side, looking through the border wall\u2019s iron bars to capture images of beautiful, middle-class neighborhoods in Mexico. Some viewers figured they had to be seeing neighborhoods in the United States, Mr. Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cPeople were like, wow, what a beautiful home,\u201d Mr. Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cHow could that be in somebody\u2019s front yard?\u201d he said, referring to the wall.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T10:48:10-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/movies/trump-border-wall-films.html", "item_type": "Article"}
