Knopf. $25.95 Michael Finkel is eating breakfast when a hermit jumps out of his newsfeed and into his heart. The hermit\u2019s name is Christopher Knight, and he would still be living undisturbed in the Maine woods had he not been caught stealing junk food from a summer camp kitchen one night. With neatly cropped hair and wearing dad jeans and glasses, Knight doesn\u2019t look very hermit-y, but he confesses to burglarizing camps, cabins and houses about 40 times a year for as long as he\u2019s lived in the woods. And just how long is that? the cops ask. Knight has to think. \u201cWhat year was the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster?\u201d Finkel, a journalist based in Montana, feels two things reading this local news story gone viral. The first is a need to know how someone could survive 27 years in the wild without death or detection. The second is kinship. Finkel presents himself as an introvert, an outdoorsman and the survivor of a 10-day silent retreat in India, among other spirit-seeking adventures. \u201cThe hermit appeared to have the same passions on an exponentially grander scale,\u201d he writes. \u201cI thought about Knight as I vacuumed the breakfast crumbs, and I thought about him as I paid bills in my office. I worried that someone with no immunity to our lifestyle, physically or mentally, was now being exposed to all our germs.\u201d After several admiring letters, and a few not entirely truculent jailhouse responses, Finkel shows up uninvited for visiting hours, and \u201cThe Stranger in the Woods\u201d launches on its short, short, short way. You may have noticed some repetition in that sentence. That\u2019s because \u201cThe Stranger in the Woods\u201d started as a 2014 GQ magazine article, and its journey to a petite 200-page book is similar to the one a meatball takes on its way to becoming a meatloaf. There\u2019s something tasty here. There\u2019s also a good deal of filler. At the jail, Finkel optimistically registers as a friend of the prisoner. He may as well be a torturer registering as a masseuse. Knight scowls through the partition glass at a point somewhere over the author\u2019s shoulder, refusing eye contact or acknowledgment. \u201cRarely in my life have I witnessed someone less pleased to see me,\u201d Finkel writes a little despondently. But what the hermit lacks in warmth he makes up for in self-awareness. Knight: \u201cSome people want me to be this warm and fuzzy person. All filled with friendly hermit wisdom. Just spouting off fortune-cookie lines from my hermit home.\u201d Finkel: \u201cYour hermit home \u2014 like under a bridge?\u201d Knight, after a Gene Wilder-worthy comedic pause: \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of a troll.\u201d Finkel shrewdly plays the punching bag while Knight alternates between jabs and details. We learn that the hermit had never spent a night in a tent before his abrupt departure from society at age 20, and that much of his survival depended on a miraculously hidden campsite. Tucked behind a tangle of brush and wind-breaking boulders, he spent decades just three minutes from the nearest cabin: \u201cTowns and roads and houses surround his site; he could overhear canoeists\u2019 conversations on North Pond. He wasn\u2019t so much removed from humanity as sitting on the sidelines.\u201d Finkel camped at the site and tells Knight he was enchanted by its tranquillity, to which the hermit responds: \u201cDo you think I was engaging in feng shui?\u201d Once settled in, Knight treated the mostly empty vacation homes around him, as Finkel puts it, like his \u201cown private Costco.\u201d He slept under a camouflage canopy on a twin-size mattress with fitted sheets and Tommy Hilfiger pillowcases. There was Purell by the portable cooler. Wildlife was abundant, but he preferred peanut butter, frozen burgers and, above all, sweets. In a survey of the damage to nearby cupboards and psyches, Finkel notes, \u201cOne kid lost all his Halloween candy; the Pine Tree Camp was short an industrial-sized tub of fudge.\u201d Knight also stole epic quantities of books, and he roars to life through his taste. He quotes Freud, Marx and Woody Allen, and recognizes himself in the narrator of Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u201cNotes From the Underground.\u201d His fetish for stillness results in a fondness for Emily Dickinson. He hates Thoreau (\u201ca dilettante\u201d) and fans of Kerouac, and may be the first person to have followed through on a threat to use John Grisham novels as toilet paper. Through culture and his opinions of it, Knight stayed in touch with the world and categorized it, without the vulnerability of human engagement. He was the Holden Caulfield of the woods. Which is not to say he lacked perspective. Knight swears he suffered no childhood trauma. His family, which never reported him missing, was flinty, self-reliant and \u201cobsessed with privacy.\u201d (\u201cThey assumed I was off doing something on my own.\u201d) He didn\u2019t choose to become a hermit \u2014 he was born one, and the woods gave him exactly what he sought. \u201cSolitude bestows an increase in something valuable, I can\u2019t dismiss that idea,\u201d Knight says. \u201cSolitude increased my perception. But here\u2019s the tricky thing: When I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. There was no audience, no one to perform for.\u2026To put it romantically, I was completely free.\u201d In one of their sweeter exchanges, relayed in an epilogue on his reporting methods, Knight calls Finkel his Boswell and tells him he likes long books. Finkel admits that his will probably be short \u2014 and it should have been shorter. Only in the epilogue do we learn that author and subject had just nine one-hour prison meetings. It\u2019s the kind of thing readers should know earlier, especially since the poverty of access leads to some bad decisions. In a search for more motive and meaning than the hermit will provide, Finkel chats with psychologists who never met Knight, a seeming violation of psychiatry\u2019s Goldwater Rule against diagnosing people from afar. There are also honkingly dull digressions into the spiritual meaning of becoming a hermit (\u201cIn Hindu philosophy, everyone ideally matures into a hermit\u201d), some pseudoscience about solitude and brain function, and an unfortunate comparison with prisoners in solitary confinement, who hardly have the luxury of choosing their solitude. All this seems like obvious padding, but to give Finkel the benefit of the doubt, it may simply be that his affinity for his amazing hermit got the best of him. He does a remarkable job persuading one of the world\u2019s more recalcitrant individuals to open up, but Finkel wants more, and it\u2019s strange that he doesn\u2019t recognize Knight\u2019s limitations. At one of their last meetings, when a wall no longer separates them, the journalist asks the hermit to shake hands. \u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d Knight replies.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T08:00:28-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/stranger-in-the-woods-christopher-knight-michael-finkel.html", "item_type": "Article"}
