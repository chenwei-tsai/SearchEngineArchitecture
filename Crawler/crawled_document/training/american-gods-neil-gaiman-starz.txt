He doesn\u2019t know the half of it \u2014 the scene was written and shot months before a polarizing presidential contest and new administration made fretting over the soul of America a national pastime. But it\u2019s just one of the ways that this audacious series, debuting Sunday, April 30, possesses surprising relevancy for a 16-year-old story about deities that have been worshiped for millenniums. \u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d at its core, is a road story about an ex-con named Shadow (Ricky Whittle), who takes up with Mr. McShane\u2019s enigmatic Mr. Wednesday. Their mission involves a rivalry between fading \u201cold gods\u201d \u2014 ancient mythological figures like Loki, Kali and Anansi, who were brought to life in America via the beliefs of immigrants \u2014 and new gods who have arisen to replace them, borne of more modern obsessions like technology and celebrity. Phantasmagorical and terrifically violent high jinks ensue, among other arresting visuals. (A reanimated corpse totes her amputated arm like a satchel. A love goddess consumes partners with her vagina.) But beneath the extraordinary imagery is a story about the power and evolution of faith, and of immigrants who helped to build and define American culture, only to see said culture turn against them. This overarching theme, as well as smaller vignettes about American newcomers, have taken on the sheen of advocacy, the show\u2019s overseers say, since Donald J. Trump\u2019s election and proposed immigration bans. The show, which finished shooting in October, was never planned as a political statement. But \u201cwhat has changed, bizarrely and drastically and unfortunately, is that now immigration is seen by too many as something to be vilified,\u201d said Michael Green, who created the series with Bryan Fuller. The new gods\u2019 hold on the American mindshare has also become exponentially more consuming since the book was written, years before Facebook, TMZ or iPhones. All of which suggests that while various \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d adaptations have been proposed since the novel came out, to no avail, there\u2019s never been a better time for one to come to fruition. \u201cSpeculative fiction usually ages very badly,\u201d Mr. Gaiman said. But in this case \u201cthe stuff that I wanted to talk about 17 years ago feels more apt, and more important, to talk about now.\u201d Conceptual underpinnings mean little without a compelling story, of course, but the showrunners\u2019 backgrounds prepared them to adapt a magical realist genre classic like \u201cAmerican Gods.\u201d Mr. Fuller\u2019s flair for hypnotic world-building and operatic, hallucinatory violence found full bloom in \u201cHannibal,\u201d another reimagining of a beloved literary property (Thomas Harris\u2019s Hannibal Lecter novels). Mr. Green is another veteran refresher of pop myths, as the screenwriter for \u201cLogan,\u201d based on the X-Men character, and \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d due out later this year. The show they created, as Mr. Whittle put it, \u201cis bananas,\u201d a neo-noir head trip mashing up mythology, science fiction and stylized gore \u2014 think slow-motion splashes of blood set to brooding cellos \u2014 as it reveals the specifics of Mr. Wednesday\u2019s quest. Like the novel, it skips around through time and space and blurs the border between reality and a more fantastical realm, lurking just below mundane American landscapes. The casting gods have been generous. Veteran performers on hand include Cloris Leachman, Orlando Jones, Crispin Glover and Kristin Chenoweth. Corbin Bernsen is Vulcan, a god of fire who has found common cause with gun enthusiasts. Gillian Anderson plays the goddess Media, first appearing as Lucille Ball and, in another scene, speaking in David Bowie lyrics. And of course for the cagey rogue Mr. Wednesday, the producers have, in Mr. McShane, television\u2019s pre-eminent portrayer of cagey rogues. (See also Al Swearengen from \u201cDeadwood,\u201d as well as the title character from \u201cLovejoy,\u201d the series that made him a star in England.) For Starz, \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d fits within a strategy that favors high-end genre tales with a built-in audience, like its \u201cOutlander,\u201d another literary adaptation. Fantasy stories in particular have a potential to connect with viewers\u2019 inner children, said the Starz president Chris Albrecht, who ran HBO when the network acquired the rights to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d in 2007. They \u201ccan be unlocked and enjoyed by almost everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly \u2018Thrones\u2019 has been an example of that, and we hope a show like \u2018American Gods\u2019 can follow in those footsteps.\u201d Mr. Gaiman, who grew up in England but moved to the United States in 1992, was driven to write \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d by an urge to understand and describe his new home. This celebrated author of both comics (\u201cThe Sandman\u201d) and novels (\u201cNeverwhere\u201d) reached a new level of success with \u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d a best-seller that won major prizes for fantasy and science fiction and horror. (He still plans to write a sequel.) The expansive story was \u201cintentionally not film-shaped,\u201d Mr. Gaiman said, but directors still made inquiries over the years. HBO planned to adapt it into a series at one point \u2014 Mr. Gaiman worked on several drafts of a pilot \u2014 but nothing came of it. After Stefanie Berk, an executive who had helped develop the project for HBO, moved to the production conglomerate FremantleMedia North America, she revisited the idea with Mr. Gaiman. (FremantleMedia is producing the series.) In 2014, they met with Mr. Fuller, then overseeing \u201cHannibal,\u201d who knew Mr. Green from their time working together on NBC\u2019s \u201cHeroes.\u201d The writers approached the story as devotees first, asking themselves \u201cwhat do you want to see in a TV show, as a fan of this material?\u201d Mr. Fuller said. They also had the ideal consultant in Mr. Gaiman, a heavily involved executive producer who weighed in on casting, read scripts and offered guidance about the story\u2019s direction. \u201cThere was only one time Neil said, \u2018If you do this, I will throw myself in front of a bus,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fuller said, referring to a plot point the showrunners were considering. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018O.K., we won\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d So far, Starz has only officially committed to the first eight-episode season, which gets through roughly a third of the book. But the creators estimate that they have enough material for perhaps five, based on related stories Mr. Gaiman has written and ideas he has, as well as their own significant expansions of the source material. Several of the novel\u2019s \u201cComing to America\u201d essays, short discrete immigrant stories, were woven into the overarching narrative. The show is bringing a story of diversity and a multiethnic cast to television at a time when movies like \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d and series like \u201cIron Fist\u201d have brought new complaints about pop culture whitewashing, or using white actors for minority characters. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing what always should be done,\u201d Mr. Fuller said. If the immigrant tales give \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d additional political heft, well, it\u2019s in good company. A wide range of TV shows have acquired new meaning and resonance with the arrival of President Trump and his policies, including political shows like \u201cVeep\u201d; social issues series like \u201cShots Fired\u201d; and even dystopian sagas like Hulu\u2019s new adaptation of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d But though the pro-immigrant stance of \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d was not planned in response to the new administration, Mr. Gaiman is \u201cperfectly happy\u201d for any viewers who might take issue with such a position to skip the series. \u201cI can guarantee you wouldn\u2019t enjoy it, so boycotting it is probably a very sensible way to go,\u201d he said. The showrunners also expanded the roles of memorable but fleetingly seen characters, like Mad Sweeney (Pablo Schreiber), a hulking, luckless leprechaun. Female characters, especially, were broadened to make the story less of \u201ca sausage party,\u201d said Emily Browning, the Australian actress who plays Laura Moon, Shadow\u2019s dead but very active wife. Laura and the ancient love goddess Bilquis, played by the Nigerian actress Yetide Badaki, are much more prominent in the show than they were in the book. Ms. Badaki was charged with executing one of the book\u2019s most famous and provocative set pieces, in which Bilquis, also known as the Queen of Sheba, ends a one-night stand by ingesting her lover. Outr\u00e9 mechanics notwithstanding, Ms. Badaki related to the underlying premise of a goddess of love struggling in a more emotionally withdrawn era. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever dated online, you definitely get that there is this loss of connection and intimacy,\u201d she said. While there\u2019s no shortage of indelible imagery, the most powerful examples connect to the show\u2019s deeper themes about faith, identity and modern American values. The creators are \u201cparticularly excited to see how viewers respond to the Salim story,\u201d Mr. Fuller said, a subplot about a gay Muslim man that includes an explicit, transmogrifying sex scene with a genie. In the second episode, Mr. Jones\u2019s African god, Anansi, drives a ship full of slaves to rebellion with a stirring monologue about the indignities black men will endure in America. At the end of the scene, the 40 actors playing slaves gave Mr. Jones a spontaneous ovation. \u201cThat was our first realization that some of the buttons we were pushing may have been hotter than we anticipated,\u201d Mr. Fuller said. Mr. Green said: \u201cYou never know what people are going to be challenged by,\u201d adding, \u201cso we look forward to them telling us.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T11:00:21-04:00", "section": "Arts", "abstract": "In this new Starz series, a culture turns against those who helped build and define it.", "item_type": "Article"}
