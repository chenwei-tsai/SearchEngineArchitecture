The diplomats are members of the powerful United Nations Security Council, an eclectic mix of America\u2019s friends and rivals, and plenty of skeptics. Their guide to the White House is Mr. Trump\u2019s outspoken envoy, Nikki R. Haley. Halibut is on the menu, and a cheese souffl\u00e9, which one Council diplomat hoped would not be the most substantial part of the White House visit. As of Sunday, it was unclear who else the Council members would see, and whether Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson would meet them. The White House meeting follows a series of slights by the Trump administration toward the United Nations \u2014 and toward the idea of international cooperation in general. They include the administration\u2019s antipathy to the climate agreement and the nuclear deal with Iran, its funding cuts to the United Nations population agency, and the broader funding cuts it has proposed for the world body. The lunch guests will include envoys from Russia and China, the countries arguably most critical to the Trump administration as it faces tests over Syria and North Korea. Both crises are sure to come up. Several diplomats are likely to raise the subject of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well, even though Ms. Haley has tried to sideline it as a regular item on the Security Council\u2019s agenda, instead describing Iran as the bigger threat to the region. For a president who has promised an \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to dealing with world affairs, this is the first opportunity, behind closed doors, for Council diplomats to gauge Mr. Trump\u2019s actual approach to the United Nations. The United States is the organization\u2019s largest single funder and, as such, its most powerful member. The visit is potentially an opportunity for Ms. Haley to show to fellow Council diplomats that she can deliver the White House, just as it is a way for her to show how much the United States matters to the United Nations. \u201cThere has been a lot of talk about China supplanting the U.S. as the top diplomatic dog at the U.N. since Trump\u2019s election,\u201d said Richard Gowan, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the Council\u2019s school outing to Washington makes it clear that it is still at Washington\u2019s beck and call.\u201d The lunch, expected to last 90 minutes, is part of a daylong visit by the members of the Security Council to Washington. It is to include meetings with members of Congress, although several Council diplomats said they had not been told which lawmakers. The lunch menu, shared with diplomats ahead of time, was capped with a pineapple brioche pudding for dessert. \u201cParticularly this week, with everything on his plate, that he would take time out and have a conversation with the Security Council is a sign that he\u2019s open to listening to them,\u201d said Nancy Soderberg, a former ambassador to the United Nations during the Clinton administration. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly surprising. It\u2019s a testament to Nikki Haley\u2019s increasing prominence within the administration.\u201d The visit by Council members comes days after Mr. Trump met for the first time with the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Their talk lasted less than 20 minutes and came after a longer meeting between Mr. Guterres and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, said the United Nations spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric. \u201cIt\u2019s an important relationship, and we are very pleased that the meeting happened,\u201d Mr. Dujarric said of the meeting with General McMaster. They agreed to meet again \u201cin the near future,\u201d Mr. Dujarric added. The Security Council has visited the White House under previous administrations. Late last year, when the members of the Council were meeting with other senior White House officials, President Barack Obama joined them for what was supposed to be a quick meet and greet and ended up staying and talking for about 40 minutes on a range of issues on the Council\u2019s agenda, according to diplomats who attended. The idea of a meeting with Mr. Trump came from Vitaly I. Churkin, the former Russian ambassador, who died in February. He brought it up this year during the Council\u2019s first meeting with Ms. Haley after she had been appointed the United States ambassador."}
