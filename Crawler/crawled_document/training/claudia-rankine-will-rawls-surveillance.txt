She and her husband, the filmmaker John Lucas, were investigating his work for a potential collaboration merging poetry, video and dance. \u201cI was a little beside myself,\u201d Mr. Rawls recalled after a recent rehearsal of \u201cWhat Remains,\u201d the project that came out of that meeting and that opens on Thursday at the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College. \u201cI was exhausted and sweaty, and in walks Claudia Rankine.\u201d They hit it off almost instantly \u2014 not always the case when it comes to artistic blind dates. Their matchmaker was Gideon Lester, the artistic director of theater and dance at the Fisher Center, who paired them not only with each other but also with a theme. \u201cWhat Remains\u201d is one of seven new works in \u201cWe\u2019re Watching,\u201d a four-day multidisciplinary exhibition organized by Mr. Lester around the topic of surveillance, broadly defined. Its guiding, open-ended question, as he put it in a recent interview, is this: \u201cWhat is the effect of the surveillance state on the experience of being human?\u201d While \u201csurveillance\u201d might conjure images of security cameras, cellphones and other machines, \u201cWhat Remains\u201d considers less concrete, more culturally ingrained kinds of surveillance that shape and have shaped the black American experience. Performed by Marguerite Hemmings, Jessica Pretty and Tara Willis, who are joined onstage by the sound designer Jeremy Toussaint-Baptiste, it draws from Ms. Rankine\u2019s landmark texts on racial violence \u2014 the lyric poems \u201cCitizen\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely\u201d \u2014 taking them apart and meshing them with movement. In responding to the exhibition\u2019s theme, Mr. Rawls and Ms. Rankine thought not only about being surveilled by others but also about self-surveillance. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing about being black in America,\u201d Ms. Rankine said, speaking by phone. \u201cYou have to curtail your movements, to live in such a way that what the white gaze projects upon blackness will not end your life. So you\u2019re always thinking, can I walk at night? Can I hold Skittles in my hand? Can I have my cellphone out? If it glitters, will somebody think it\u2019s a gun? At what point can I just be?\u201d Just being, or just dancing \u2014 the luxury of that and, perhaps, the impossibility \u2014 is a point of interest for Mr. Rawls. His own work often addresses, through marriages of movement, music and text, the complexities of being black in the predominantly white lineage of postmodern dance. \u201cOne never just happens to be black, even in the most abstract dance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhiteness in our society \u2014 and this is something Claudia talks about, too \u2014 is the space that produces the conditions and terms against which all other lives are measured and enabled or disabled. Dance doesn\u2019t escape those power dynamics.\u201d In addition to Ms. Rankine\u2019s writing, \u201cWhat Remains\u201d takes inspiration from the essay \u201cWriting the Void,\u201d by Homi K. Bhabha, published last summer in Artforum. Mr. Rawls said that the notion of a void, or what Ms. Rankine has called \u201cthe already dead space,\u201d is integral to the work, invoked through dancing, speaking, singing and the stark performance space itself, a cinder block storage room in the vast Fisher Center, which was designed by Frank Gehry. \u201cThe already dead space is where one resides, or is born into, or gets relegated to, when one is black in our society,\u201d Mr. Rawls said. \u201cIt\u2019s a space of heightened potential and unrealized potential.\u201d For an artist whose main tools are the body and space, that concept presented a paradox: \u201cHow do I choreograph a void into being?\u201d he said. \u201cHow do I bring so many elements together, not to create a pileup, but a very open constellation?\u201d At a rehearsal in Lower Manhattan two weeks before the show\u2019s opening, Ms. Willis and Ms. Pretty sat at a table, microphones before them, letting the word \u201cyou\u201d spill from their mouths, again and again. Distorted, drawn out and intoned at different registers \u2014 with digital assists from Mr. Toussaint-Baptiste \u2014 the syllable began to take on a life of its own, no longer a familiar word but a twisted web of sounds. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed all these techniques for delivering poetry,\u201d Mr. Rawls said. \u201cThe last thing I want is portentous recitation in a dark room.\u201d Ms. Rankine said she was pleased with the metamorphosis of her words. \u201cIt\u2019s been fascinating to see a word become its consonants, lose its vowels, be connected to an arm movement.\u201d Also at play is video footage of the dancers, captured by Mr. Lucas during rehearsals. \u201cI tried to get them in their quiet moments, when they didn\u2019t know they were on camera, or were preparing to be filmed,\u201d he said in a phone interview. In reflecting on violence and disappearance, Mr. Rawls sees the hopefulness of dance: \u201cIt really is the body insisting on its own presence, over and over and over, from second to second, minute to minute.\u201d Yet while \u201cWhat Remains\u201d has movement \u201cstirring up a sustained sense of energy and persistence,\u201d he said, the acts of speaking and singing, for him, are no less physical. \u201cThe voice comes from the body, it is of the body,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything is carried by the bodies of the performers. In that sense, it\u2019s all a dance.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/arts/dance/claudia-rankine-will-rawls-surveillance.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:18:11-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "Claudia Rankine and Will Rawls: Surveillance and the Black Experience", "item_type": "Article"}
