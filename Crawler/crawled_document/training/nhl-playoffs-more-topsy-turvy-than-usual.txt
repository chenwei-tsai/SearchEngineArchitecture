{"abstract": "Blown leads, overtime games and unlikely stars have been the hallmarks of the opening round of Stanley Cup action.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "The first week of the N.H.L. postseason has been as unpredictable as anyone could imagine, even in a sport where upsets are the norm, home-ice advantage is often meaningless and a hot goaltender can overshadow everything else. The Chicago Blackhawks, a perennial Stanley Cup favorite, are down by three games to none to the Nashville Predators, and the N.H.L.-leading Washington Capitals trail the Toronto Maple Leafs by two games to one in their first-round series. But those are only parts of the story. Seven of the first 24 games featured a blown lead of two goals or more, 11 went to overtime, and winning goals came from the unlikeliest of sources. On Monday, all four games went to overtime for only the third time in N.H.L. history and the first time since 1985. The Blackhawks and the Capitals blew two-goal leads, sowing more seeds of doubt and giving the Predators and the Maple Leafs a jolt of confidence. \u201cOur guys think they\u2019re a good hockey team, and they\u2019re playing a good hockey team,\u201d Toronto Coach Mike Babcock said. \u201cBut I think you gain respect for yourself in the process, and you start believing that maybe you can do this.\u201d The Blackhawks\u2019 core has three Stanley Cups in the past seven years and a lot of experience to lean on. Washington has only playoff disappointments in the rearview mirror, and panic about another early exit is setting in, with Game 4 looming Wednesday night. The Capitals will not have the shutdown defenseman Karl Alzner, missing his second consecutive game with an upper-body injury, a significant blow to their depth and penalty killing. But Alex Ovechkin should play more than the 15 minutes 8 seconds he did in the Game 3 loss. \u201cThat\u2019s on me, to get him in the ice time,\u201d Washington Coach Barry Trotz said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t based on play. I thought Ovi was playing terrific. It\u2019s on me to get him a little more ice time, no question.\u201d Ovechkin and the Capitals were heavy favorites to beat the young Maple Leafs, but the series has been anything but one-sided as all three games have gone to overtime. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot closer match than people let on,\u201d Trotz said after a Game 3 loss in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s not David and Goliath.\u201d Chicago versus Nashville looked that way before the series, but the Blackhawks now face a daunting task trying to become just the fifth N.H.L. team to overcome a 3-0 series deficit. They have some company in that hole, with the Minnesota Wild down by 3-0 to the St. Louis Blues and the Calgary Flames down by 3-0 to the Anaheim Ducks. Trotz has tried to argue that the talent gap is not big between even the top and bottom playoff teams, but there is a chance for four sweeps. There were only four sweeps combined in the first round of the past seven playoffs. The defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins entered Tuesday night\u2019s game in Columbus ahead of the Blue Jackets, 3-0. That is not a big surprise, given how Columbus stumbled down the stretch, but Blue Jackets goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky has been a disaster. Bobrovsky, the favorite to win the Vezina Trophy as the league\u2019s best goalie, opened the playoffs with an 0-3 record, a 3.49 goals against average and a league-worst .897 save percentage after finishing first in both categories during the regular season (2.06 G.A.A., .931 save percentage). Some of the biggest goals so far have come from surprising players, including Zack Kassian scoring two game-winning goals for the Edmonton Oilers to put them up by 2-1 over the San Jose Sharks entering Tuesday\u2019s Game 4. Even the Ottawa Senators have gotten goals from defenseman Dion Phaneuf and the struggling wing Bobby Ryan to go up by 2-1 on the Boston Bruins heading into Game 4 Wednesday. Senators Coach Guy Boucher said of Ryan, \u201cI always say that you make your money during the season, but you make your reputation in the playoffs, and right now he\u2019s showing everybody that he\u2019s a gamer.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/sports/hockey/nhl-playoffs-more-topsy-turvy-than-usual.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T19:48:37-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "N.H.L.
