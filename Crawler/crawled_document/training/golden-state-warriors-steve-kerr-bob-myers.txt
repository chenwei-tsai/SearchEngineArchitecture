It just might not be right away. \u201cLook, what he\u2019s facing is fixable,\u201d Myers said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s just finding the issue and solving it. So I think that\u2019s how you have to differentiate what he\u2019s going through with somebody else. \u201cSome things are not fixable in life. Some things that confront people don\u2019t have solutions. There is a solution here. We just need to discover it, and we will. I\u2019m confident we will.\u201d Kerr, 51, plans to be examined at Stanford this week and is away from the team until he feels well enough to return. He did not coach the Warriors in Games 3 and 4 at Portland last week while dealing with symptoms that make him extremely uncomfortable. This is hard for Myers beyond business. He and Kerr are friends who talk every day, and not just about basketball. He supported Kerr, the reigning coach of the year, when he had to miss the first 43 games last season, including a league-record 24-0 start. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s not insurmountable,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThis one, we will overcome it. And those aren\u2019t just words, that\u2019s the truth. I wouldn\u2019t put a time on it, but that\u2019s how I feel. Certain diagnoses you are forced to accept entirely and know that there isn\u2019t a solution. There is a solution for this; we\u2019ve just got to find it.\u201d For now, the top assistant, Mike Brown, is leading the way with an experienced coaching staff and a veteran team as the Warriors, who had the N.B.A.\u2019s best regular-season record, wait to learn their next opponent \u2014 the Los Angeles Clippers or Utah \u2014 after sweeping Portland in four games. Brown and Kerr are in continual communication, including after the Jazz took a 3-2 series lead with a victory over the Clippers on Tuesday night. Brown is prepared to coach the Warriors into the second round until Kerr is able to return. \u201cSteve\u2019s going to be a part of this process all the time,\u201d Brown said. \u201cReally, almost before I do anything, I\u2019m going to consult with him.\u2019 ROCKETS OWNER FINED The owner of the Houston Rockets, Leslie Alexander, was fined $100,000 by the N.B.A. for confronting a referee during live game action. The episode occurred Tuesday in the final minute of the first quarter during the Rockets\u2019 105-99 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. Alexander left his courtside seat and walked toward the referee Bill Kennedy. Alexander then said something to Kennedy before turning around and heading back to his seat. The Rockets eliminated the Thunder in five games and will face the San Antonio Spurs or the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference semifinals.", "title": "Warriors\u2019 Owner Has Hope, but No Timetable, for Steve Kerr\u2019s Return", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T19:22:35-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/sports/basketball/golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-bob-myers.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00"}
