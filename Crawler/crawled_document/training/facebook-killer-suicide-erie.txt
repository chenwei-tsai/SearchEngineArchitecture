{"text": "A man who the police say shot a 74-year-old man in Cleveland, and then posted a video of it on Facebook, shot and killed himself on Tuesday after a brief pursuit in Erie County, Pa., a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania State Police said. The State Police attempted to pull over the man, Steve Stephens, the spokeswoman, Diana Bates, said. Mr. Stephens then pulled over and shot himself to death, she said. The manhunt for Mr. Stephens had extended across the country, with widespread news coverage and social media fueling reports of multiple sightings, some as far away as Detroit and Houston. Mr. Stephens, 37, was being sought in what the authorities said was a random shooting of Robert Godwin Sr. A warrant for Mr. Stephens\u2019s arrest on a charge of aggravated murder had been issued, and the police asked residents of Indiana, Michigan, New York, northeast Ohio and Pennsylvania to be on alert. Mr. Stephens said in a video on Sunday that he had killed multiple people, but the police said there was only one known victim.", "source": "The New York Times", "section": "U.S.", "created_date": "2017-04-18T12:08:37-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/facebook-killer-suicide-erie.html", "title": "Man Wanted in Cleveland Facebook Murder Kills Himself, Police Say", "item_type": "Article", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "abstract": "Steve Stephens shot himself when Pennsylvania State Police were attempting to pull him over, the authorities said.", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T12:53:28-04:00"}
