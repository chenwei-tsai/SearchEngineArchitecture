It was unclear whether the strike could be sustained to the point of forcing concessions from the Israeli authorities, but experts said it nonetheless had the potential to stir passions among Palestinians. \u201cIsrael is taking it seriously simply because of the possible consequences,\u201d said Ghassan Khatib, a professor at Birzeit University and a former Palestinian official. \u201cThe issue of prisoners is very emotional.\u201d The strike also comes at a difficult time for the Palestinian Authority, whose leader, Mahmoud Abbas, is aging and unpopular; potential rivals are increasingly showing an interest in succeeding him. Polls suggest that Mr. Barghouti, 57, is the most popular choice to replace Mr. Abbas, even though he is serving five life sentences after he was convicted of being a leader of the second intifada and of directing attacks that led to the killings of Israelis. Starting on Sunday, many of the more than 5,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons declared that they were on a hunger strike, which prompted demonstrations of support on Monday in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s de facto capital, and elsewhere in the West Bank. The prisoners\u2019 demands include more family visits, an end to solitary confinement, better health care and greater access to education. Qadura Fares, director of the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Club, a nongovernmental organization, said the prisoners would not end the hunger strike until their demands had been met. Mr. Barghouti wrote in an Op-Ed essay published on Sunday by The New York Times that \u201cIsrael has established a dual legal regime, a form of judicial apartheid, that provides virtual impunity for Israelis who commit crimes against Palestinians, while criminalizing Palestinian presence and resistance.\u201d \u201cWe will not surrender to it,\u201d he added. Although Mr. Barghouti belongs to Mr. Abbas\u2019s Fatah party, and most of the strikers are Fatah members, its rival Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, said that it supported the strike and that some of its members would take part. Israeli officials said that they did not negotiate with prisoners. The Israeli prison service said that hunger strikes were illegal and that participants would be disciplined. \u201cStrikes and protests are illegal activities and will face unwavering penalization,\u201d the service said in a statement."}
