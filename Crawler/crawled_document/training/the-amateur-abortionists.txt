{"abstract": "Will we once again need an underground network of women willing to risk it all to help others?", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Imagine a stay-at-home mom who can do an abortion. Or a college student. Imagine she knows how to administer local anesthesia, has the medicines to induce miscarriage, can dilate a cervix, scrape a uterus. Imagine a group \u2014 with no medical training \u2014 performing dozens of abortions a week, in secret, at great risk to themselves, their families and the women they serve. That is the story of Jane, an underground group in Chicago that carried out thousands of abortions between 1969 and 1973, when abortion was illegal. It\u2019s a story of code names and safe houses, a story of women taking control of their lives and teaching other women to do the same. Abortion providers and the women they serve now fear that such an underground service may again become necessary. Abortion remains legal, but one conservative justice has just joined the Supreme Court and many are concerned that another will follow. This month the president signed a bill to cut funding to Planned Parenthood and other providers. Many states have enacted laws that make obtaining an abortion exceedingly difficult: About 90 percent of counties have no abortion clinics. In many areas, the procedure is nearly as inaccessible as it was in the days of Jane. Back then, if a woman was pregnant and didn\u2019t want to be, doctors would not help her. Abortion was a felony in 49 states. Many \u201cback alley\u201d abortionists could not be trusted. What to do? Call Jane. In 1965, a University of Chicago student, Heather Booth, then 19, helped a friend\u2019s sister find a doctor willing to do an abortion. \u201cI was told she was nearly suicidal,\u201d Ms. Booth told me. \u201cI viewed it not as breaking the law, but as acting on the Golden Rule. Someone was in anguish, and I tried to help her.\u201d Ms. Booth was eventually deluged by so many similar pleas for help that she \u201csaw the need to set up some kind of system.\u201d By 1969, she had enlisted a group of women who formed the Abortion Counseling Service of Women\u2019s Liberation. They advertised in student and underground newspapers: \u201cPregnant? Need help? Call Jane.\u201d (Why \u201cJane\u201d? One member just liked \u201csweet names.\u201d) By 1970, Jane was referring two dozen women a week to a few willing doctors for abortions. Callers left a message on an answering machine. \u201cCallback Jane\u201d would collect information and pass it on to \u201cBig Jane,\u201d who would supply an address \u2014 \u201cthe front\u201d \u2014 where patients would receive counseling. Eventually they\u2019d be taken to a different address \u2014 \u201cthe place\u201d \u2014 such as a member\u2019s home or a motel room, where a doctor would induce miscarriage or perform a surgical abortion. Patients were sometimes blindfolded so that they couldn\u2019t identify who\u2019d helped them. Each was sent home with antibiotics and instructions for follow-up care. Soon, it was not only college students who called. Many patients were already mothers, many of them poor, some of them abused. The Janes \u2014 all of them women \u2014 took careful notes on each caller and held weekly meetings to discuss safety. They were troubled by the male abortionists\u2019 tendency to shame patients and the procedure\u2019s high cost ($500 to $1,000). Then, in 1971, the group discovered that one of the abortionists was not, as he\u2019d claimed, a doctor. But he was performing up to 20 abortions a day and was \u201cmore skilled than a doctor who performed only a few abortions a year,\u201d writes Laura Kaplan, a former Jane member, in her book, \u201cThe Story of Jane.\u201d The women realized, \u201cIf he can do it, then we can do it, too.\u201d One of the Janes persuaded him to teach her. Within months she had learned the procedure and soon trained others. The Janes were able to cut ties with back alley abortionists, dispense with blindfolds and lower the price to $100, with poor women paying less. Only about four of the 100 or so women who joined Jane ever became skillful enough to perform surgical abortions. The others mostly answered calls, found safe apartments and assisted by sterilizing instruments and changing bedsheets. They acted as counselors, chauffeurs, nurses. No woman is known to have died at the hands of the Jane abortion providers. One Chicago obstetrician, who had agreed to provide follow-up visits to Jane patients, attested that these practitioners had a safety rate roughly the same as that of the legal clinics then operating in New York. In 1972, the police raided an apartment where Jane operated. Three patients waiting for abortions were taken to a hospital. Seven Jane members were arrested, among them a high school English teacher, several housewives with young children, and a student who was about to adopt a baby. In the police van, one removed from her purse a stack of 3-by-5 cards with contact information for women who\u2019d called for help. They ripped off the corners with the patients\u2019 names and addresses, and swallowed them. The \u201cAbortion Seven\u201d were indicted. But before their case went to trial, the Supreme Court legalized abortion in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The charges were dropped. Jane disbanded. Ms. Booth is now an organizer with the consulting group Democracy Partners. \u201cWe will never go back underground,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen and men assume that abortion will be available, that women can determine when or whether to have a child. That change is enormous.\u201d And yet abortion restrictions are once again so widespread that some activists are preparing for a modern-day service like Jane. Elizabeth Ziff, a member of an \u201cunderground feminist group,\u201d is one of them. \u201cThey \u2014 this administration \u2014 are coming for all of it, the morning-after pill, birth control, abortion, all of it,\u201d said Ms. Ziff, who is also a singer and guitarist for the feminist rock band Betty. \u201cWomen will suffer if we aren\u2019t willing to take radical steps. And that includes learning how to perform abortions.\u201d But the situation for women seeking abortions and the activists who might help them is today far different from that of the Jane era. Charlotte Taft, a former director of the Abortion Care Network, said no one should \u201cunravel a coat hanger,\u201d especially now that \u201cmedication can create abortion far into a pregnancy.\u201d A woman who wishes to end a pregnancy up to 10 weeks, when most abortions happen, can get pills from a doctor \u2014 a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 and miscarry at home. If she cannot arrange or afford an appointment with a doctor, there is another way, though it is risky and illegal. The medications can be ordered online and taken with instructions available from groups like the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition \u2014 but the drugs aren\u2019t always from safe sources, and several women have been prosecuted for doing this. And what if surgery is required? Dr. Paul Blumenthal, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University School of Medicine, points out that in developing countries, laypeople are trained to do many procedures normally performed by doctors in the West, including C-sections. \u201cYou can train anybody to do just about anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I figure out a way to have a safe house somewhere? Would I teach? I might.\u201d Groups like the National Network of Abortion Funds already offer financial and logistical assistance to women seeking abortions. Ms. Ziff thinks things might get much worse. \u201cWe\u2019re stockpiling the morning-after pill, everything,\u201d she said. No woman wants an abortion from a rock musician or the mom down the street. Abortion is a normal medical procedure and belongs in the mainstream of health care, safe, legal and accessible. But if that is no longer the case, women will call for it anyway, as they always have, and there\u2019s no doubt that modern-day Janes will answer, ready to help.", "section": "Opinion", "title": "The Amateur Abortionists", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/opinion/sunday/the-amateur-abortionists.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T14:30:18-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T14:30:18-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "item_type": "Article"}
