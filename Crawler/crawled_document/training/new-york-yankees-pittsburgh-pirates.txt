It was a spectacular setting for baseball, and Ivan Nova made the most of the tableau, a former Yankee pitching another gem to lead Pittsburgh to a 2-1 victory over the Yankees. Nova, a right-hander with an easy delivery and a personality to match, struck out the side in the first inning and was rarely troubled. He allowed four scattered hits over seven innings, escaped his lone jam by dispatching Aaron Judge on a 6-4-3 double play, and allowed only a home run to Jacoby Ellsbury, in Nova\u2019s final inning. Nova\u2019s biggest concern was his friends in the visitors\u2019 dugout who were trying to throw him off his game by getting him to laugh. \u201cCastro tried once or twice,\u201d Nova said, referring to Yankees second baseman Starlin Castro, who joked with Nova after a bloop single. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t work.\u201d The Pirates were playing in their 1979 uniforms \u2014 black pants, canary yellow tops and pillbox caps \u2014 and had opportunities to make their afternoon more comfortable. But they were 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position, manufacturing only one run from the two times they loaded the bases with no outs. The Yankees\u2019 best chances came once Nova was lifted for a pinch-hitter. But reliever Daniel Hudson struck out Castro with a high fastball to end a tense nine-pitch at-bat with runners at the corners in the eighth. The usually reserved Castro slammed his bat down in anger. In the ninth, Pirates closer Tony Watson had to overcome his own defense after second baseman Josh Harrison booted a made-to-order double play, loading the bases instead of ending the game. Watson responded by striking out Aaron Hicks and retiring Pete Kozma on a ground ball. There was little such drama when Nova was on the mound. The way Nova pitched on Sunday and the way he has thrown for the Pirates since they acquired him at the trade deadline last summer make it fair to wonder if the Yankees gave up on him too soon. Nova, 30, signed a free-agent contract with Pittsburgh for three years and $26 million, which is looking like a bargain. Yankees Manager Joe Girardi dismissed the suggestion. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Girardi, whose team pursued closer Aroldis Chapman, but not Nova, in free agency after trading him in 2016. \u201cYou look at the numbers at our place. He had some good years; he had some tough years. We had to make a decision. Last year, at that time, we thought it was the right move to make, and we made the move and you don\u2019t look back.\u201d The Pirates have recently reconstructed themselves into playoff contenders with help from Yankees castoffs. Catcher Russell Martin, who the Yankees believed was in decline at age 29, left for Pittsburgh as a free agent. The Yankees paid the Pirates $13 million to take pitcher A. J. Burnett. The Pirates\u2019 current catcher, Francisco Cervelli, was a spare part with the Yankees, as was Chris Stewart, Pittsburgh\u2019s other catcher. Stewart was behind the plate Sunday, and he hit a triple for the first time in 1,047 major league at-bats. Another Pirate with Yankees ties is the current pitching ace Gerrit Cole, a first-round draft pick of the Yankees who instead chose to go to U.C.L.A., then went to the Pirates as the top overall pick in 2011. Nova has continued that trend, transforming from a maddeningly erratic pitcher with an earned run average that hovered around 5.00 to a strike-throwing automaton. He has a 2.75 E.R.A. and as many complete games (four) as walks (four) since he arrived in Pittsburgh last summer. (Nova walked his first hitter of the season on Sunday \u2014 pitcher Jordan Montgomery, who was making his first at-bat since high school.) \u201cWe are the type of organization that needs to take guys maybe when they\u2019re on the downslope and work to get them back on the up slope,\u201d Pirates General Manager Neal Huntington said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we have some magic formula here, but we do like our coaches, we do like our performance team, we do like our advance guys. Our manager and our catchers all do a nice job.\u201d For pitchers like Burnett and Nova, Huntington said, \u201cthere\u2019s a natural breath of fresh air\u201d after leaving the American League East, with its power-packed lineups and cozy ballparks, for a place where pitchers have to hit. Nova, who like many former Yankees has grown a beard since he left, said he was the same pitcher. But he acknowledged that the Pirates\u2019 pitching coach, Ray Searage \u2014 who is revered for cultivating reclamation projects \u2014 has tinkered with his mechanics and persuaded him to use his changeup more often. The difference, Nova said, is that his mind is clear. \u201cI always say it\u2019s hard to pitch when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen after,\u201d said Nova, who was in and out of the Yankees\u2019 rotation the last two seasons. \u201cIf you have a bad game, are you going to be in the rotation or the bullpen? It\u2019s not the way that you should be thinking. \u201cIn New York,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey never told me if you pitched bad, you would be in the bullpen, but that was my thought process. That was my mistake, thinking that way. Here I just want to focus on pitching every five days.\u201d Thus far, Nova has excelled at that, and on Sunday the Yankees were forced to admire the view.", "abstract": "Nova has flourished since he was traded to Pittsburgh last summer."}
