But they still owned partial rights to a certain 1990 movie based on Margaret Atwood\u2018s book.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "On Wednesday, one of the most anticipated television shows of the year, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d had its premiere on the streaming service Hulu. Reviews for the series have been rapturous, and it could provide Hulu with an elusive signature hit. But none of this would have been possible without Danny and Fran. Until recently, the production company run by Daniel Wilson, 87, and his business partner, Fran Sears, 70, had more or less been dormant. Work had dried up, and Hollywood had stopped getting in touch many years ago. Whenever the phone rang, they assumed that people were \u201ctrying to find out if we were, in fact, still alive,\u201d Ms. Sears said in a recent interview, laughing. But Mr. Wilson had something special stowed away: He controlled a big chunk of the TV and movie rights to the 1985 Margaret Atwood novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which he had made into an otherwise forgettable 1990 feature. If Hulu wanted to bring the story to television, it would have to deal with Daniel Wilson Productions. So through a twist of fate, prescient deal-making and an intensely competitive television landscape \u2014 where studios seem to be willing to turn over any stone to find a hit \u2014 Danny and Fran are back in business. In short order, they had to, among other things, revive a production company that had gone dark and study up on a vastly changed television landscape, in which streaming services were becoming increasingly important. They also had to acquaint themselves with tasks foreign to them \u2014 like creating an online imprint. \u201cWe just looked at each other and said, \u2018Oh, God, we better do this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sears said, about creating a website. \u201cWe\u2019ve been terrible about a Wikipedia page or IMDB. It\u2019s not part of our sensibility.\u201d Mr. Wilson added, \u201cIt\u2019s not really good,\u201d describing their website. On a recent Tuesday in Manhattan, the duo (they are, alas, not a couple) were discussing their unlikely comeback at Mr. Wilson\u2019s Upper East Side apartment. Over the course of an afternoon, Ms. Sears excused herself each time the phone rang. \u201cDaniel Wilson Productions,\u201d she cooed as she answered. A bookshelf in the living room was filled with awards Mr. Wilson had won in the 1970s and \u201980s, including several Emmys. It was difficult to identify what some of the Emmys were for; the plaques were too faded. Though Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears were not in charge of making \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d they found themselves, somewhat surprisingly, in the role of executive producers. They were given a front-row seat to script development, casting and the production process, and offered notes to the writers and executives overseeing the show. They marveled at just how much the business had changed. Television executives nowadays? \u201cMuch less combative,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. And they have been transformed from cigar-chomping titans to, as Ms. Sears put it, \u201cyoung hipster types.\u201d Then there were the dailies, rough cuts from each day of filming. They used to be an exhaustive process that took hours to produce, with filmmakers packing a room to watch poor-quality film reels of scenes shot the day before. Now, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears could watch high-quality footage from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d from the comforts of their own homes, at 8 a.m. each day. \u201cI\u2019d get up in the morning, I\u2019d be wandering around, crashing into the wall in my jimjams with a cup of coffee, and I\u2019d watch the dailies and call up Danny and say, \u2018Did you watch that?\u2019\u201d Ms. Sears recalled. Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears met in the 1960s when they were working on a children\u2019s show for ABC. Soon, Daniel Wilson Productions was up and running, and they were making after-school specials with titles like \u201cThe Terrible Secret\u201d and \u201cMe and Dad\u2019s New Wife.\u201d As awards piled up for the specials, they branched out to make successful TV movies and mini-series. Daniel Wilson Productions had a staff of a dozen people, with offices in New York and Los Angeles. It was in the late 1980s when, at the suggestion of his wife, Mr. Wilson read \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d the dystopian novel that presents a grim future for women in the United States. Impressed, Mr. Wilson met with Ms. Atwood, secured the film rights to the book and shared them with the independent movie company Cinecom, which helped finance the film. The movie, which starred Robert Duvall and Natasha Richardson and was written by Harold Pinter (Ms. Atwood was not interested in screenwriting), was released in 1990 and was a dud at the box office. (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good as perhaps it should have been,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.) Soon, their careers began to wind down. Mr. Wilson learned that his wife had Alzheimer\u2019s, and he put aside work to tend to her. Ms. Sears said she would return to the business only if she actually had passion for a project. \u201cI guess I just didn\u2019t really think that was going to happen,\u201d she said. Then everything changed. About five years ago, with scripted TV booming in Hollywood, MGM decided to forge ahead with a plan to make \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d into a series. The studio assumed it controlled the rights. Then it found out otherwise. \u201cWe realized, \u2018Wait a minute, no, no, no, it\u2019s not all ours,\u201d said Steve Stark, the studio\u2019s president for television development and production. \u201c\u2018We have to call a Danny Wilson. Where\u2019s he at?\u2019 We didn\u2019t know. We couldn\u2019t find him.\u201d It took some time to track him down, and, initially, Mr. Wilson was unmoved. Cinecom had gone bankrupt, and Mr. Wilson was convinced he owned all the rights to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d In fact, MGM had secured what was once Cinecom\u2019s 50 percent. Even in the sometimes confounding world of Hollywood copyrights, this odyssey was \u201cexceptional,\u201d Mr. Stark said. It took a lengthy negotiation to get Mr. Wilson on board. \u201cWe decided to make him an executive producer, we gave him a nice fee, and we figured it all out,\u201d Mr. Stark said. Mr. Wilson did not disclose financial details, but the deal, if the show reaches a third season (which appears possible, considering the reviews), is expected to be worth $1 million. The show was originally written for Showtime by Ilene Chaiken, a veteran of \u201cThe L Word.\u201d Mr. Wilson did not like her script, which he said was far too \u201cgraphic sexually.\u201d \u201cThey wanted bare-breasted women running around,\u201d he said, sounding exasperated. But Ms. Chaiken was soon tied up with obligations to the new Fox hit \u201cEmpire,\u201d and the story was back on the market. Suddenly, FX and Hulu were neck and neck in pursuit of the series. But Hulu? \u201cFor me, Hulu is where you can watch old episodes of \u2018The Andy Griffith Show,\u2019 if you\u2019re so inclined,\u201d Ms. Sears said. Mr. Wilson was not entirely sure to trust the streaming service until Mr. Stark convinced him it was just fine. \u201cI heard about it from Steve, and I said, \u2018Really?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Danny, they\u2019re the new kid on the block; they\u2019re going to back this series to the hilt.\u2019 \u201cI said, \u2018Terrific!\u2019\u201d Bruce Miller, the new showrunner for \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d wrote scripts that they adored. Elisabeth Moss, a veteran of \u201cMad Men,\u201d seemed ideal to play the main character, Offred. For Hulu, which has failed to match the buzzy original series of rivals like Amazon and Netflix, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d may have finally delivered a drama that can drive up subscriptions. It also didn\u2019t hurt that the Trump administration has made the show\u2019s bleak themes feel more relevant to certain viewers. \u201cIts timing is a hell of a lot better than when the feature was released,\u201d Ms. Sears said. \u201cMargaret\u2019s book was extraordinary, but it was about another time. We didn\u2019t see it coming fast and furious at us the way it is now.\u201d Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears are hopeful that \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is just the beginning of their comeback. And last Friday night, they were able to take their victory lap in earnest. As Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears circled a room in the Beekman Hotel for the show\u2019s premiere party, a remix of Prince\u2019s \u201cRaspberry Beret\u201d blasted at full volume. And what did these two reborn producers think of their return to show business, all these years later? They answered in unison: \u201cLoud!\u201d", "title": "How Hulu and \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Revived 2 Careers", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T17:41:57-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/business/media/how-hulu-and-the-handmaids-tale-revived-2-careers.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00"}
