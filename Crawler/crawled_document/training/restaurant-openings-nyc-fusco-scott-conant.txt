{"abstract": "A rooftop bar from Dale Talde, Dominique Ansel\u2019s Los Angeles plans, and other openings and restaurant news.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "FUSCO Scott Conant, the chef and restaurateur who was one of Manhattan\u2019s stars of Italian food, is back, in a significant way. Since his ties to Scarpetta were severed a number of years ago, Mr. Conant\u2019s presence in New York has been limited. But this intimate restaurant, in the former Veritas space, is likely to change that for him. It\u2019s named after his grandmother Carminella Fusco Varrone, who came from Italy, but the food is definitely not Italian-American. Mr. Conant describes it as ambitious, seasonal new-school Italian, with a menu that will change at least monthly. A smoked eggplant tartlet; truffled pea Caesar salad; short ribs with fava bean salsa verde and horseradish; crab cannelloni with uni; and escolar with black rice, cuttlefish and an oxtail sauce are offered \u00e0 la carte, or they may be part of a tasting menu. The dining room, done in white with mirrors and crystal chandeliers, is an elegant throwback, tablecloths and all. \u201cI want it to harken back to a more thoughtful approach to dining,\u201d he said. He has also added some high-top tables to the bar area. (Opens Monday): 43 East 20th Street, 212-777-5314, fusconewyork.com. BADSHAH Charles Mani, who was the executive chef at the well-received but short-lived Babu Ji in the East Village, is now cooking in this Indian restaurant in Hell\u2019s Kitchen from the owners of Surya in the West Village. Several of his dishes evoke street food, including gol goppa semolina balls with chutney. There are some tandoor specialties and rich butter chicken: 788 Ninth Avenue (52nd Street), 646-649-2407, badshahny.com. BAR MOGA Named for Japanese flappers, this bar is an East-West affair, with Japanese flavors in cocktails like the Devil\u2019s Pocket Watch, with Scotch, sweet potato sochu and apricot liqueur among the ingredients. Plates of comfort food include ramen, fried shrimp and croquettes: 128 West Houston Street (Sullivan Street), 929-399-5853, barmoga.com. FAT PIG Memphis-style slow-cooked pork and brisket are the specialties to eat in or take away at this new spot with a garden: 120 Dyckman Street (Nagle Avenue), Inwood, 646-490-4555. THE HEIGHTS The city\u2019s many rooftop establishments are reopening for the season, and here is a new one from Dale Talde and his partners, on the roof of the hotel where they already have a restaurant, Massoni. The draw is the close-up view of the Empire State Building from the AvroKO-designed terrace. Detroit-style pizza served whole or by the slice, salads and Italian sandwiches are served, as are cocktails, beer and wine: Arlo Nomad Hotel, 11 East 31st Street, 212-951-1141, theheightsarlonomad.com. ORTZI Jose Garces, the Philadelphia chef who opened Amada in Battery Park City last year, has added this Times Square outlet for Basque food, which he fell in love with while living in Spain. His menu goes from single-bite tapas to more substantial cazuelas, often served in traditional terra-cotta pottery. Hamachi with piquillo peppers, fava bean salad and robust stews of tender rabbit and of mixed seafood are a few of the dishes. The chef de cuisine, Michael Han, worked at Bouley and A Voce. The wine list focuses on Spain and France, as do the cocktails. The intimate, inviting black-accented dining room, seating 50 (with another 24 places in the bar and lounge), has a vibrant mural and a central open kitchen with a roaring fire. (Monday): Luma Hotel, 120 West 41st Street, 212-730-8900, ortzirestaurant.com. ROS\u00c9 TERRACE AT PERRINE Along the 61st Street side of the hotel Pierre, the restaurant Perrine has added a seasonal sidewalk terrace. Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Esclans in Provence is a partner in this venture, and its popular ros\u00e9 wines, including Whispering Angel, are featured. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and weekend brunches are served: Perrine, the Pierre, 2 East 61st Street, 212-940-8195, perrinenyc.com.

DOMINIQUE ANSEL IN LOS ANGELES The New York pastry chef who has bakeries in London and Tokyo, and who was named No. 1 pastry chef in the world at this year\u2019s World\u2019s 50 Best presentation, will be opening his first restaurant, not just for desserts, in a Los Angeles complex in the fall.

ONE VANDERBILT The office tower being built by SL Green Realty and its partners on the full square block just west of Grand Central Terminal, meant to anchor the East Midtown district, is being designed with dining in mind. A Daniel Boulud restaurant is planned. \u201cIt\u2019s an iconic building, and the appeal is that mine will be the only restaurant in the building,\u201d Mr. Boulud said. \u201cThe density of the area is another advantage.\u201d He described a second-floor dining room with about 100 seats that will not be as classic as his uptown flagship, Daniel, but that he envisions as a destination. The ground floor will have one of his \u00c9picerie Boulud shops for takeout. He has not selected a name. One Vanderbilt is what he said he was using for the time being, and it just might stick. \u201cDaniel will help define 1 Vanderbilt as among the most prestigious office buildings of this new era,\u201d said Marc Holliday, the chief executive of SL Green. Mr. Holliday said the third floor of the building would have amenities like private dining rooms, just for tenants. QUALITY EATS Michael Stillman will be opening two outposts of his West Village steak house featuring unusual cuts.
