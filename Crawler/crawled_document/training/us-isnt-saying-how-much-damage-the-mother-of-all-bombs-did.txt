The reticence of the United States to discuss casualties and other damage from the 22,000-pound bomb concerns local officials in Nangarhar Province who supported the massive bomb after military officials said ground operations had failed to penetrate the Islamic State stronghold in the mountains of the Achin district. \u201cI and other people have this concern \u2014 that why American forces are not letting anyone visit the scene of the bombing?\u201d said Zabihullah Zmarai, a member of the council in Nangarhar Province who held a post-bombing news conference to announce his support. \u201cThe U.S. authorities should provide an answer to this question.\u201d Afghan security officials say that clearance operations are taking place around the site, and that Islamic State fighters are engaging Afghan and American forces, who are calling in more airstrikes to target the militants\u2019 positions. There are also reports that the American military has kept even Afghan forces from the bombing site. One senior Afghan security official in Kabul said on Tuesday that Thursday\u2019s bombing killed 96 Islamic State militants, 13 of them major commanders. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media, provided the names and basic information about the commanders, most of whom were from the tribal areas across the border in Pakistan, but who also included some Indian citizens and Central Asians. However, the official provided no proof of the deaths or information on how officials reached the number of 96. The United States military, despite repeated attempts, did not provide comment. The Islamic State\u2019s local radio outlet, which was unaffected by the bombing, continues to broadcast into Jalalabad, the urban center in the east. It broadcasts half-hour programs during the day and an evening program that often lasts more than an hour. As early as the day after the bombing, it broadcast a call-in program in which voices of men who claimed to be fighters in the area who were not affected by the powerful bomb could be heard between rhyming Islamic chants. \u201cThe media was expecting that this bomb would have killed all the Islamic State fighters or forced them to flee, but that is not the case,\u201d the program\u2019s anchor said. \u201cAfter the big bomb, our warrior, brave youth became a shield in front of them.\u201d Islamic State radio, known as Voice of the Caliphate, has been reconstituted after it was destroyed last year by a targeted American drone attack. Afghan officials said that the earlier operation was run by five militants from the back of a small truck that switched locations often to avoid being targeted. Islamic State affiliates in Afghanistan expanded rapidly in 2015, before repeated Afghan military operations and American airstrikes brought them to a halt. Islamic State fighters are now estimated at about 700, down from 2,000 to 3,000, and their activities are reduced to mainly three districts in Nangarhar. The tunnel complex in the Tangi Assadkhel area of Achin prevented military operations from eliminating the group entirely, American military officials have said in justifying the first use of the bomb, the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast. Naser Kamawal, another Nangarhar provincial council member, said the bomb did not seem to have succeeded in its mission. Afghan forces had not advanced past the areas they had cleared repeatedly long before the bombing. \u201cWhy the bomb with such a big destruction had such few casualties?\u201d Mr. Kamawal said. \u201cIf there was some 90 Islamic State militants, then why were our own Afghan forces not able to eliminate them in a military operation \u2014 what was the need for using such a big bomb?\u201d It was unclear whether any Afghan or coalition forces have made it to the bombing site five days after the attack. The senior Afghan security official said the day after the bombing that Afghan commandos had done so and, after clearing the site, had handed it over to American military forensic teams. Mr. Zmarai, the provincial council member, said local officials in Achin told him that neither Afghan nor American forces had arrived at the site. A spokesman for the Afghan commandos, Jawid Salim, agreed. \u201cIt is not true that the members of U.S. forensic are at the scene of bombing \u2014 no one is there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in the area and we see everything.\u201d Afghan commando forces advancing the day after the bombing overcame resistance about a mile from the site but continued with operations in other parts of Achin instead of going to the scene, he said, adding that American airstrikes were helping them during follow-up operations. Mr. Salim expressed satisfaction that the bomb hit what he called an important target, and he seemed satisfied by the security official\u2019s report that more than 90 fighters were killed. \u201cThey say it destroys everything within two miles, but that could be in plain land \u2014 in mountainous areas, the bomb may not have such big destruction,\u201d Mr. Salim said, speculating, like so many other officials, in the absence of any concrete information.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/world/middleeast/us-isnt-saying-how-much-damage-the-mother-of-all-bombs-did.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T14:04:47-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "U.S. Isn\u2019t Saying How Much Damage the \u2018Mother of All Bombs\u2019 Did", "created_date": "2017-04-18T14:04:47-04:00", "section": "World"}
