Consumed in a do-it-yourself circle of divorce and domestic hell that at times feels as inescapable as McCarthy\u2019s apocalypse, the father in Daniel Magariel\u2019s feral and tender first novel, \u201cOne of the Boys,\u201d won\u2019t hesitate to use his own children as human shields, no wounds spared. Told from the perspective of his 12-year-old son, this is a gorgeously tight tale swelling with wisdom about the self-destructive longing for paternal approval and the devastating consequences of clinging to rotten models of masculinity. The story opens in Kansas in the final days of \u201cthe war,\u201d as the father calls the custody battle over his two boys. (In keeping with the book\u2019s spare tone, they all go unnamed.) After Mom has struck the narrator with a telephone, the father asks him to exaggerate the violence to convince child protective services, and his older brother, that she\u2019s the enemy to defeat. \u201cNow, son, try to look how you felt when she hit you,\u201d he suggests as they take pictures to document the abuse. \u201cI could try slapping him,\u201d the older boy jokes \u2014 at which point the father begins to reveal himself: \u201cHow would you feel about that, son?\u201d When the children waver, torn between worship and disgust as they will be throughout, their father pushes harder. \u201cI thought you wanted to come with us,\u201d he wheedles. This will bring back the happy days, he promises; this will set them free. And, in an early glimpse of the grim ride ahead, the boy gives in. \u201cWith my right hand I slapped my right cheek. The left cheek with my left hand, then again, harder \u2026 so that eventually my head turned not from the flinch but from the blow. \u2026 I faced my father. \u2018Now,\u2019 I said. \u2018Take it now.\u2019\u201d Magariel knows that nothing drives men more than the fear of losing Dad\u2019s love, but \u201cOne of the Boys\u201d is not about filial shortcomings. This is a novel about conquering the addiction to abuse and the perverse idea that it\u2019s somehow a form of loyalty. That\u2019s not an easy notion for the young narrator to give up. Before he learns that being a man sometimes means becoming the opposite of your father, he will submit again and again. The father\u2019s plan is to move the boys to Albuquerque, where the prospect of life away from Mom beckons. The mirage that they\u2019ve left the real threat behind is enhanced, for a while, by the analgesic beauty of the Southwest. As they come to the brutal, liberating realization that they are on their own, the boys look at the sky and the land with abductee hope, allowing Magariel to revel in piercing descriptions of place, as when he renders the looming mountains \u201cred as stirred embers.\u201d Settled in New Mexico, they indulge for a time in the high of starting afresh. They pick new schools, the older brother poised to become the star of his basketball team. But the father\u2019s ghosts check in sooner than they are prepared for. What emerges is the portrait of a man obliterated not just by a crack addiction he can\u2019t shake but by the demands of single parenthood. His sons are a source of devotion and repugnance in equal measure. He might say aloud that he never really wanted to become a father, but he also announces, after the boys have a fight, that it was \u201cmy idea to have both of you. \u2026 You wouldn\u2019t exist without me. You boys, you\u2019re so close in age, you\u2019re supposed to be there for each other. \u2026 What are you looking at me for? Look at your brother. \u2026 This is your brother for life. You are his last line of defense.\u201d This is a novel without much in the way of humor, or even chances for the boys to be carefree adolescents, and those that it does have feel tinted dark. Rather than providing a breath of relief, they harden the novel\u2019s pathos. Respite comes as nostalgia. At the peak of violence, Magariel often cuts to memories of better times \u2014 the boys playing with Dad, all three kids again. This leitmotif, hinted at in the title, also shapes the book\u2019s affecting outcome. Yet for all the pain they inflict on one another, for all the betrayal and resentment trapping them together, Magariel\u2019s characters \u2014 the male ones, anyway\u2014 never feel typecast or pitied. (The mother\u2019s presence is too scant for her characterization to become as sage or nuanced.) One day, after Dad has spent weeks holed up in his room to nurse his addiction, the boys finally see him again. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize him,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cThe frays of his cuffs dragged across the carpet like uprooted plants. \u2026 He was an electronic device running out of charge.\u201d When a police officer comes knocking, the father and boys panic and hide, \u201ccrammed together under his desk, my father in the middle. The plan was: Keep quiet and wait for the cop to leave. \u2026 My father shook horribly, his muscles convulsing. I put my arms around him, squeezed as hard as I could. \u2026 My eyes met my brother\u2019s, and while mine expressed gratitude to him for locking up, for being reliable and doing his job well, I was devastated to find his full of disgust for the scene of me cradling our dad.\u201d Magariel\u2019s gripping and heartfelt debut is a blunt reminder that the boldest assertion of manhood is not violence stemming from fear. It is tenderness stemming from compassion.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T05:00:30-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/one-of-the-boys-daniel-magariel.html", "item_type": "Article"}
