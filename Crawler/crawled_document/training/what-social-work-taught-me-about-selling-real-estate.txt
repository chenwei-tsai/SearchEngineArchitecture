They\u2019re accountants, educators (\u201cRemember: The contract isn\u2019t binding until both parties sign it\u201d), decorators (\u201cJust think how the foyer would look with a coat of Dorset Cream\u201d), perhaps even stand-up comics (\u201cA dishwasher? A washer and dryer? A walk-in closet? A second bedroom? Yes, all perfectly doable with your budget \u2014 but wait, does the apartment have to be above ground?\u201d). And, of course, they have to be psychotherapists with just the right words of reassurance and comfort at their command when a client loses a bidding war or gets turned down by a co-op board. (\u201cThis wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d \u201cThings happen for a reason.\u201d \u201cWhen the right place comes along, everything will fall into place for you.\u201d) Sales agents whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9s include jobs as mental health providers may be way ahead of the game. The skills they developed as counselors \u2014 how to listen, how to interpret, how to advocate and negotiate \u2014 couldn\u2019t be better preparation, they say, for guiding clients through the thicket that is home-buying in New York City. The reasons for their career switch: burnout and the desire to make more money. \u201cReal estate is really just social work in a different arena: In both, you have to understand what\u2019s being said and to interpret what\u2019s not being said,\u201d said Anna Hargraves Hall, 47, an agent at Stribling who has a Master of Social Work from Columbia. She did field work at a school for blind and low-vision children, followed by a stint with Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a need to understand what a huge decision it is to buy an apartment, not just financially but emotionally,\u201d she added. \u201cThese are both relationship businesses where you\u2019re placed in a role of extreme trust,\u201d said Jenet Levy, 59, a sales agent at Halstead, who also has an M.S.W. from Columbia and has worked with teenagers in the foster care system and as a youth employment counselor. \u201cIt\u2019s important in both occupations for clients to believe you know where they\u2019re coming from, for them to believe that you\u2019re seeing things from their side.\u201d It\u2019s a point of pride for Carey Larsen that she doesn\u2019t have a sales pitch. \u201cI think people often hard-sell in this business,\u201d said Ms. Larsen, 42, an agent at Citi Habitats who spent seven years as a domestic violence counselor, an occupation, she said, that taught her the value of being a good listener. Ultimately, she decided that she wanted the flexibility of self-employment. \u201cWhen brokers say to a client, \u2018Isn\u2019t this a wonderful view?\u2019 before they have a chance to discover it for themselves, I think it\u2019s just annoying,\u201d Ms. Larsen said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken people to an apartment with a full-on view of the Statue of Liberty, and I didn\u2019t point it out. I waited for them to see it and react before I said a word.\u201d Hank Orenstein, 59, an associate broker at Corcoran, worked as a resident counselor for adults coming out of psychiatric facilities, and as a social services director at a family shelter in the South Bronx before deciding, 11 years ago, that it was time for a change \u2014 time for a more remunerative occupation. And after all, he had sort of grown up in the business: His father was a real estate tax assessor for the city. His skills, he quickly learned, transferred well. \u201cWe have a technique in social work called \u2018being where the client is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Orenstein said. \u201cIf, say, a parent is angry and upset that her 14-year-old is out of control and cutting school, you need to find out what\u2019s going on with the child. But first you need to deal with the parent\u2019s distress and make clear that you understand how the parent is feeling and that you\u2019re not judging.\u201d \u201cHow that translates to real estate,\u201d he added, \u201cis listening to people\u2019s criteria and not dismissing those criteria out of hand, no matter how unattainable.\u201d Recently, Mr. Orenstein worked with a woman who was insistent on a doorman building in a specific part of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, at a specific price point, with a washer and dryer in the apartment. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her, \u2018That\u2019s not going to happen,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI told her the percentage of co-ops that had what she wanted, but that we would stick with the plan of finding such a place.\u201d It took a year; the place was found. Mr. Orenstein also relies on his mastery of what\u2019s known in therapy as cognitive reframing: pointing out that there\u2019s a gap between what people say they want and what they\u2019re willing to do to achieve it. \u201cI might say, \u2018On one hand, you\u2019re telling me you want to live in a large one-bedroom apartment with a doorman in the heart of the Upper East Side. But on the other hand, what the market is telling us is that what you\u2019re willing to spend isn\u2019t going to get you there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Orenstein said. \u201cThat\u2019s better than saying, \u2018You\u2019re not being realistic.\u2019\u201d During her 15 years as a private adoption consultant, Mary-Jean Gianquinto worked with many women who had made the decision to become single parents. She had always been interested in real estate, she said, and after investing successfully in several properties, she felt the time was right, last summer, to go into the profession full time. Now an agent at Halstead, Ms. Gianquinto, 56, who has an M.S.W. from the University at Buffalo, has made something of a subspecialty of working with single women looking to buy an apartment. \u201cWhen a single woman makes a decision to create a family, she is making a statement to the world,\u201d Ms. Gianquinto said. \u201cA single woman who\u2019s looking to buy an apartment after a lifetime of renting is making a statement, too. In both cases, there\u2019s a lot of angst and trepidation.\u201d She recently found a co-op near Prospect Park in Brooklyn for a single woman \u201cwho kept saying, \u2018Who am I to be doing this?\u2019\u201d Ms. Gianquinto recalled. \u201cShe felt she wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing this without a partner. I would tell her that it\u2019s O.K. to make the decision on her own; it\u2019s O.K. to feel you deserve something.\u201d The client who finds fault with every property? The one who drags her feet about signing a contract? The fight over a sconce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s staying!\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s going!\u201d \u2014 that threatens to derail a closing? Who better than someone with clinical experience to get to the bottom of an issue without losing the client or the commission? Joan Kagan, 48, the sales manager at TripleMint and a former counselor for developmentally disabled people and their families, recalls working with a woman whose recent divorce required her to vacate a grand apartment on Park Avenue. She was now downsizing to a co-op in the same neighborhood. But the deal had stalled. Ms. Kagan\u2019s client was upset about a small crack in the ceiling. She complained that the door handles were cheap and that there was a problem with one of the electrical outlets in the bathroom. It was a very nice, affordable apartment, and the seller was getting frustrated that the contract hadn\u2019t been signed. \u201cI asked my client, \u2018Is it the ceiling crack that\u2019s bothering you? Because we can get that fixed,\u2019\u201d Ms. Kagan said. \u201cI got her to acknowledge that it was really about the loss of a very extravagant home and what that had all meant to her. It wasn\u2019t that there was no electrical outlet in the bathroom. It was that she was scared.\u201d A background in counseling is hardly a guarantee of real estate success. And, obviously, many sales agents without such experience do just fine. Some may be excellent listeners by nature, with the empathy of Oprah. If not, however, a few real estate firms have courses designed to help them. The orientation program at William Raveis NYC includes role-playing as a way to help new agents \u201cunderstand a client\u2019s psyche,\u201d said Kathy Braddock, a managing director of the firm. And Douglas Elliman\u2019s \u201cDE University\u201d offers professional development seminars on topics like \u201cThe Power of Words,\u201d \u201cThe Art and Science of Persuasion,\u201d \u201cMeeting Clients in Their Model of the World\u201d and, cutting right to the chase, \u201cThe Psychology of Sales.\u201d Counselors-turned-brokers could lead a seminar of their own: Reassuring the First-Time Buyer. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Don\u2019t rush into anything,\u2019\u201d Mr. Orenstein, of Corcoran, said. \u201cAllow time to explore different neighborhoods and be open-minded. People put themselves into boxes, so the social worker in me wants to say to them, \u2018Expand your horizons.\u2019\u201d For her part, Ms. Gianquinto, of Halstead, wants those new to the market to remember that they have choices. \u201cThis should be an empowering experience,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust your instincts. When it\u2019s the right apartment, you\u2019ll know it. You won\u2019t necessarily know why it\u2019s right, but you\u2019ll know it is.\u201d And, Ms. Gianquinto added, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to say no. You\u2019re not there to please anyone.\u201d Including your real estate agent? \u201cEspecially your real estate agent.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T09:00:17-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/realestate/what-social-work-taught-me-about-selling-real-estate.html", "item_type": "Article"}
