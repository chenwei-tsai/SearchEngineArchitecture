Will that change the culture?", "section": "World", "text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Machismo has long been widespread in Mexican society. Male entitlement \u2014 reflected in telenovelas, movies, work settings, families and romantic relationships \u2014 has been tolerated, even celebrated. But times are changing for the Mexican macho man, or \u201cmachista.\u201d Soaring crime rates against women in recent years, and a strengthening women\u2019s rights movement, have forced Mexicans to begin addressing machismo and the harm it does through sexism, misogyny and violence. The effort got a boost on International Women\u2019s Day last month, when President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto called on Mexico \u201cto launch a frontal assault against all expressions of machismo.\u201d He urged the eradication of \u201ca deeply rooted machista culture,\u201d one that \u201cultimately and truly generates violence against women.\u201d While women\u2019s rights advocates view the public acknowledgment of the problem \u2014 as well as some political and legislative gains for women \u2014 as a good start, they are skeptical about societal change. They say that can happen only by confronting the entrenched ideas fueling machismo. Gendes, a research and advocacy group in Mexico City that seeks to improve male behavior through counseling, education and public awareness campaigns, is trying to do just that. Jorge, a university professor in Mexico City who asked that his last name not be used to protect his family\u2019s privacy, came across a pamphlet advertising group therapy and decided to give it a try. His relationship with his wife had suffered after a violent episode. One night, his wife arrived 30 minutes late to meet him for a movie, and he felt she did not seem sufficiently remorseful. Their argument migrated from the sidewalk to their apartment, where, in a rage, Jorge threw her to the ground and punched her in the face, bloodying her nose. He said it was the first time in the relationship that his anger had turned physical, and he feared that his wife would leave him. \u201cI had to do something,\u201d Jorge said in an interview. \u201cI felt curious to know if it was something I could actually change and if I could learn new ways of relating to people, particularly women.\u201d Ruben Guzm\u00e1n, a Gendes counselor, said the goal was \u201cletting go of the person you were taught to be.\u201d The free therapy, given three times a week, seeks to question and address the cultural beliefs that lie at the heart of machismo, said Antonio Vargas, director and founder of Gendes, which is privately funded. In a small conference room at the Gendes office, about a dozen men, including Jorge, sat in a circle one evening, trying to work though their propensity for anger and misogyny. For this session, Jorge brought news of a new flare-up. His wife had caught him looking at photographs of another woman on his iPad. He tried to defend his behavior. \u201cTo look is not a sin. It is part of being a guy, and everyone does it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am so stupid for not erasing the search history.\u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, the counselor, interjected: \u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d Jorge, a veteran of many sessions, stayed quiet, and another member of the group, H\u00e9ctor, who like the other men did not want his surname revealed, filled the silence. \u201cJustification,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind of violence is this?\u201d the counselor asked Jorge. \u201cEmotional and sexual,\u201d Agust\u00edn responded. \u201cWhy?\u201d the counselor continued. \u201cBecause it breaks agreements of sincerity and fidelity,\u201d Jorge said. In an interview later, Jorge said he had been working hard to uproot his machismo. He traced the tendency back to his childhood, which he spent in a low-income neighborhood on the outskirts of Mexico City. \u201cIt was a place where if you weren\u2019t violent with others, you were a victim of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want my little boy to become a little machista, or my daughter to think the only way of solving things is through violence.\u201d Women have made significant gains in elected office in Mexico, in part because of a series of measures ensuring their greater participation in politics. Most recently, a 2014 law requires that half of all the candidates fielded by a political party in federal or state legislative elections be women. And a decade ago, the Mexican Congress passed a law that outlined a legal framework for all levels of government to prevent, address and punish gender-based violence. Gloria Careaga, a professor in gender studies at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said that as gender roles had begun to shift, men had not learned how to find new ways of relating to women. \u201cMen here have not been taught any alternative ways of being a man in this country,\u201d Ms. Careaga said. That tension, she said, has driven many men to violence. The National Citizens Femicide Observatory, a coalition of human rights and women\u2019s groups in Mexico that studies violence against women, reported that annual female homicide numbers more than doubled between 2007 and 2015, from 1,086 to 2,555. Last year, Mexicans in dozens of cities took to the streets in the first nationally coordinated demonstration against machismo and violence against women. Major Mexican companies are weighing in as well. Tecate, a popular beer brand, started a television advertising campaign last summer featuring a woman covered in bruises. \u201cA man is defined by how he treats a woman,\u201d the voice-over said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t respect women, Tecate is not for you. We don\u2019t want you to buy beer from us.\u201d But old habits die hard. \u201cIt is very convenient and comfortable to be a man in Mexico; it comes with great benefits,\u201d said Mr. Vargas, the Gendes founder. \u201cIt is not easy to renounce privilege.\u201d The men in the Gendes group therapy sessions know this all too well, as they have struggled to acknowledge, understand and change their behavior. During a recent session, the men stared at the floor. The conversation was punctuated by deep sighs. A man named Alejandro said his girlfriend had discovered that he had sent sexually charged WhatsApp messages to a neighbor. The counselors pushed him to examine his behavior. \u201cI tried to control her by flirting with our neighbor behind her back,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIt is emotional and sexual violence.\u201d Another man, Federico, admitted to trying to intimidate his sister by kicking a door and breaking a window. Fabi\u00e1n said he had responded to his girlfriend\u2019s accusations of infidelity by pushing her off their bed. H\u00e9ctor confessed to grabbing his wife by the arms and demanding that she listen to him. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, the counselor, asked the men to name the emotions they were feeling after listening to one another\u2019s confessions. Fear, they said. Sadness. Hope. After the session, Jorge reflected on his progress and the uncertain path that lay ahead. \u201cThe question now is: What else can I do to change?\u201d he said. \u201cIs it actually possible to live without violence? I have hope that it is.\u201d"}
