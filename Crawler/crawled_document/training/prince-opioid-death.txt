Search warrants and affidavits from the Carver County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is leading the continuing homicide investigation in conjunction with the Drug Enforcement Administration, were unsealed on Monday. The documents do not solve the mystery of where Prince got the powerful opioid fentanyl that killed him. But they sketch a picture of how this musician, a strict proponent of clean living who suffered from chronic hip pain, concealed his opioid addiction using a variety of methods, including mixing various prescription pills in bottles for everyday products like Bayer and Aleve. In at least one instance, Prince procured an opiate prescription in the name of Kirk Johnson, a personal friend and employee since the 1980s, according to investigators. Prince was found dead in the elevator of his home on April 21, 2016, by Mr. Johnson and others after he ingested the fatal amount of fentanyl, which is often used to manufacture counterfeit pills that are sold on the black market as oxycodone and other pain relievers. Investigators have said they are most concerned with who obtained the fentanyl, and have yet to charge anyone in Prince\u2019s death. They noted in court records that those who were present at the home that morning \u201cprovided inconsistent and, at times, contradictory statements.\u201d The warrants, dating from April to September of last year, show investigators tracking to what extent Mr. Johnson had helped Prince conceal his drug habit, at one point applying for a search warrant for Mr. Johnson\u2019s cellphone records. Dr. Michael T. Schulenberg, who treated Prince for the hip pain in the weeks before his death and arrived at Paisley Park with test results that morning, told investigators that he had prescribed the singer oxycodone on April 14, a week before the fatal overdose, \u201cbut put the prescription in Kirk Johnson\u2019s name for Prince\u2019s privacy,\u201d according to a search warrant. That prescription was filled on the same day that Prince\u2019s private jet was forced to make an emergency landing in Illinois after the singer overdosed during a flight home after a concert in Atlanta. Mr. Johnson told hospital staff at the time that Prince \u201cmay have taken Percocet,\u201d an opioid, on the plane, according to one application for a search warrant. In several instances, Mr. Johnson, who had unrestricted access to Paisley Park, told the investigators that he had limited knowledge of Prince\u2019s dependence on painkillers. On the day before the singer\u2019s death, Mr. Johnson said he went to a local Walgreens to pick up three prescriptions issued by Dr. Schulenberg for drugs often used to treat anxiety; according to the court papers, he said it \u201cwas the first time he had ever done something like that for Prince.\u201d Among the additional evidence found at Paisley Park was a suitcase with a name tag for \u201cPeter Bravestrong,\u201d an alias used by Prince, containing several prescription bottles in Mr. Johnson\u2019s name. (The suitcase also contained lyrics for the song \u201cU Got the Look,\u201d apparently in Prince\u2019s handwriting, according to investigators.) In addition to Prince\u2019s bedroom, pills were found throughout the residence, including in the laundry room, the police said. A lawyer for Mr. Johnson, F. Clayton Tyler, said he had not read the documents yet and could not comment. The Associated Press has reported that Mr. Johnson has not been interviewed since hours after Prince\u2019s death. In a recent interview with CBS, including a tour of the Paisley Park compound, Mr. Johnson was asked about Prince\u2019s final days. \u201cKirk has a vault,\u201d he said. \u201cRight here. It\u2019s never gonna be unlocked.\u201d Among the drugs seized were 20 and a half white pills labeled \u201cWatson 853,\u201d a mix of acetaminophen and hydrocodone, that were found in an Aleve bottle. Investigators later found that the pills contained fentanyl, according to published reports, but they have not given any indication as to whether those pills have been tied to Prince\u2019s death. Notes from investigators say that 64 and one-quarter matching Watson 853 pills were also found in a Bayer bottle, and another 15 were discovered in a second-floor dressing room. Some overdoses, officials say, are attributable to the fact that people take what they believe is a pain pill of a strength they are familiar with and die because they are unaware it has been produced with a much stronger drug, like fentanyl. Others who spoke to investigators included Andrew Kornfeld, the son of Dr. Howard Kornfeld, an opioid-addiction specialist who had been called on to treat Prince. Andrew Kornfeld arrived at Paisley Park after Prince had died with a small dose of the drug Suboxone, an anti-addiction agent. Also interviewed was the singer Judith Hill, who was in a romantic relationship with Prince and was on board during the diverted flight. In addition to an Apple laptop belonging to Prince, who stopped using a cellphone after his was hacked, friends said, investigators received warrants for numerous email addresses \u2014 including mistag3@gmail.com, peterbravestrong@gmail.com and paisleyparkafterdark@gmail.com \u2014 that Prince used to communicate with his tight inner circle. Dr. Schulenberg\u2019s lawyer could not be reached for comment on Monday. She has said that he has not been interviewed by investigators since the day Prince died. Dr. Schulenberg has not been the subject of any disciplinary action, according to the records of the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice. \u201cThe investigation remains active at this point,\u201d said Jason Kamerud, chief deputy for the Carver County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cWe\u2019ve gained a lot of progress over the last year, but there still is some more work to be done,\u201d he said.", "material_type_facet": "News", "abstract": "Newly released court documents reveal that the singer\u2019s home was strewn with narcotic painkillers for which he did not have prescriptions.", "title": "How Prince Concealed His Addiction: Aspirin Bottles of Opiates", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/arts/music/prince-opioid-death.html", "section": "Arts", "item_type": "Article"}
