{"text": "To the Editor: \u201cPutting On a Brace, and a Show\u201d (Arts pages, April 19), heralding the actor Andy Karl\u2019s triumph in a leg brace in the opening performance of the Broadway show \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d was in stark contrast to the March 25 Critic\u2019s Notebook article about audiences questioning the actress Madison Ferris\u2019s wheelchair as exploitation in \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d There\u2019s a term we in the disabled community know: perceptual snap. You see a handsome young man in a brace, your heart breaks and then Snap! He has a tear in his anterior cruciate ligament but still took a star turn on Broadway! You see a vibrant woman in a wheelchair, your heart breaks and then Snap! She is permanently disabled, and it makes you so uncomfortable you find it hard to watch. I applaud both performers. But I despair that some theatergoers see them so differently.
