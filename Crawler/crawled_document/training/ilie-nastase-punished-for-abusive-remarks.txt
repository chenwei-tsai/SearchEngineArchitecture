{"abstract": "The ex-champion, 70, is being investigated by the I.T.F. over an alleged racist comment about Serena Williams and was ejected from a Fed Cup tie after other outbursts.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "CONSTANTA, Romania \u2014 Ilie Nastase, the Romania Fed Cup captain and former star player, was expelled from a Fed Cup tie with Britain on Saturday after making abusive comments. The International Tennis Federation had already launched an investigation into racially offensive comments Nastase apparently made on Friday about Serena Williams\u2019s pregnancy. On Saturday, with Britain\u2019s Johanna Konta leading Sorana Cirstea by 6-2, 1-2, Nastase became embroiled in a squabble about noise from the crowd. When the umpire appealed for calm, Nastase said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the opera. What\u2019s your problem?\u201d The comment included an expletive. Nastase, who is 70, was heard to hurl expletives at Konta, the British captain Anne Keothavong \u2014 who also is pregnant, and whose room number he had publicly asked for \u2014 and the umpire. He was sent off the court by the referee, Andreas Egli, and, after taking a seat in the stands, was escorted back to the locker room. \u201cMr. Nastase was also removed from the grounds due to his serious misconduct,\u201d the I.T.F. said, and his accreditation was removed. In a separate incident on Saturday, Britain\u2019s Press Association said Nastase berated the journalist Eleanor Crooks for reporting his comments about Williams. Nastase told Crooks: \u201cWhy did you write that? You\u2019re stupid, you\u2019re stupid.\u201d The tirade went on for more than two minutes, the news agency said. The I.T.F. had said it was investigating Nastase after Crooks reported that speaking of Williams\u2019s baby, he told a member of his team at Friday\u2019s news conference: \u201cLet\u2019s see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?\u201d Williams, 35, the winner of the Australian Open in January and of 22 previous Grand Slam singles titles, confirmed on Wednesday that she is pregnant. She and Alexis Ohanian, a founder of Reddit, are engaged. \u201cHe repeatedly called me stupid, asked me why what he said was racist,\u201d Crooks said. \u201cI explained we simply reported what he said and that it was unnecessary to make such a comment about color. He said the English were out to get him and called me stupid a few more times.\u201d The match between Konta and Cirstea eventually resumed, with the British player winning five games in succession to record a 6-2, 6-3 victory and level the tie at 1-1. Nastase won two Grand Slam titles: the United States Open in 1972 and the French Open in 1973.", "section": "Sports", "title": "Ilie Nastase Punished for Abusive Remarks", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/sports/tennis/ilie-nastase-punished-for-abusive-remarks.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T11:46:10-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T11:46:10-04:00", "material_type_facet": "List", "item_type": "Article"}
