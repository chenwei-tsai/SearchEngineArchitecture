The plangent, folksy guitars are right behind, of course, but they\u2019ve been served a warning: No longer do they need to be front and center for a young country singer looking to make a mark. Indeed, Ms. Bryan, who is 18 and hails from Sequim, Wash., is on a mission to rebuild country stardom with parts gathered far and wide: Miley Cyrus\u2019s shimmery turn as Hannah Montana and her pre-twerk flirtation with country-pop; country singers with mild soul inclinations like Sara Evans and Lauren Alaina; pop singers like Alessia Cara and Halsey who serve as counter-narratives to pop\u2019s perky instincts. And of course, Taylor Swift, whom Ms. Bryan has studied in depth, from that singer\u2019s early-career fixation on cool girls and the girls they exclude, and also the way she alternates between breathlessly racing through syllables and then pulling back to hit a few of them with power. On each song on Ms. Bryan\u2019s excellent, infectious debut EP, \u201cSo Far,\u201d she refracts country music through a slightly different prism. \u201cOwn It,\u201d the opener, is cheeky teen-pop \u2014 it could be the theme song for a quirky Disney Channel heroine: \u201cI break things, like hearts and iPhones,\u201d she sings. As if to shore up her country bona fides, that\u2019s immediately followed by \u201cHard Drive Home,\u201d a lovely, grand smear of sadness that features some of Ms. Bryan\u2019s most powerful singing. After that is \u201cScars,\u201d which perhaps borrows a touch too much from Ms. Cara (including a song title similar to one of her hits) but is filled with rich songwriting \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll show you mine if you show me yours/let\u2019s scatter our ashes here on the floor\u201d \u2014 and shout-outs to \u201cMarilyn, Cobain and James Dean.\u201d The closest aesthetic peer Ms. Bryan has in contemporary country is probably Sam Hunt, who offers advanced-placement seminars in reconfiguring the genre\u2019s DNA. Ms. Bryan is a less versatile singer (and hasn\u2019t started rapping, at least not yet), but her instincts for finding underexplored musical pockets within country is impressive. She has a writing credit on each song on this EP, as does Dennis Matkosky, who produced it. A symbol of the effectiveness of Ms. Bryan\u2019s choices is that, even in her most country-friendly moments, Nashville outsiderdom is embedded into her work, right down to the lyrics on \u201cUsed To,\u201d a song about leaving the womb for a shot at adulthood. \u201cDon\u2019t feel so alone \u2019til you\u2019re there on the phone and your mama says \u2018I miss you,\u2019/that\u2019s when it hits you,\u201d she sings. The song moves with a slow confidence, and just the faintest hint of blues guitar, underscoring Ms. Bryan\u2019s sweet-voiced melancholy. \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to the way it rains in Tennessee,\u201d she sings. But at this rate, Nashville is just a way station \u2014 she won\u2019t be there for long.", "material_type_facet": "Review", "item_type": "Article"}
