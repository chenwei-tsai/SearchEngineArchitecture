(Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) In a time of shrinking newsroom budgets, one area of coverage is enjoying a surge in California. The cannabis beat. Writing about marijuana as a consumer good has traditionally been relegated to magazines or alternative news weeklies. But that\u2019s changing. On Nov. 9, the day after voters approved Proposition 64, legalizing recreational marijuana, a coalition of 25 California newsrooms introduced a website, The Cannifornian, to host their cannabis reporting. Around the same time, The San Francisco Chronicle became the latest big city newspaper \u2014 after The Denver Post \u2014 to create a cannabis editor position. It hired David Downs, 36, a longtime marijuana journalist and author. We caught up with him by phone. A few excerpts from the conversation: Q. What kind of coverage will you focus on? A. It\u2019s going to be a mix of journalism with a capital \u201cJ\u201d and then heavy reader service. There\u2019s a very serious demand for basic orientation information. Cannabis is like its own planet and people want to visit but they don\u2019t know how to get around or what the etiquette is, let alone what these products are and what they do. And so we\u2019re going to be building that bridge for them. Q. And product reviews? Yeah. We will be reviewing cannabis products as well as vaporizers and other hardware. We think that cannabis has the potential to be more mainstream and be reviewed like wine or beer or other consumables at a really high level with a really discerning and independent perspective. Q. What\u2019s your read on Washington\u2019s reaction to the rollout of legalization in California? A. I\u2019ve certainly already seen that [Attorney General] Jeff Sessions\u2019s rhetoric has chilled support for investment at the institutional level. But I\u2019ve also seen the owner of Miracle-Gro continue to snap up local cultivation-related companies because he knows that a person growing a plant in their backyard or their garage is really not going to be affected either way by what Jeff Sessions does. Q. What do people say when you tell them your job? A. They say things like \u2018It\u2019s about time.\u2019 And they wonder what the perks are. Q. What are the perks? A. I\u2019m sitting at a desk full of random stuff. Yesterday, I got a box in the mail from a group called MunchEase, and they\u2019re selling supplements that you would take that would theoretically reduce your desire to eat everything in sight when you smoke cannabis. Another good product we got was this scratch-and-sniff book of weed that just came in \u2014 that was one of those things that was long overdue. It\u2019s a real Cambrian explosion of products and services. And we would be remiss not to wade in there on behalf of readers.

Just west of downtown Riverside rises Mount Rubidoux, a 1,330-foot outcropping of weathered granite. Since 1909, a cross dedicated to Jun\u00edpero Serra atop the mountain peak has been the centerpiece for yearly sunrise Easter ceremonies. During their height in the 1920s, the services drew enormous crowds, reported to have surpassed 30,000 people. Boy Scouts were enlisted to hold lanterns along the path to light the mile-long hike up the mountain during the predawn darkness. To this day, the Scouts have remained a feature of the services. On Sunday, hundreds of bleary-eyed congregants rose once again for this year\u2019s Easter service. As they ascended the mountain, scouts stationed along the path recited scripture, The Press Enterprise reported. At the top there were songs, sermons and a golden sunrise.
