It was a proud capstone on the center\u2019s three-day festival, Tito Puente Retrospective: 50 Years of \u2018El Rey,\u2019 which was both a celebration and a corrective. Led by the percussionists Jos\u00e9 Madera and John Rodr\u00edguez (known as Dandy), both longtime Puente associates, the 20-piece band ran through a range of work by the so-called King of Latin Music, from the buoyant mambo of \u201cQu\u00e9 Ser\u00e1 Mi China\u201d to the romantic bolero \u201cTus Ojos.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the first time anyone\u2019s done a three-day retrospective \u2014 worldwide,\u201d said Joe Conzo Sr., a Puente confidant turned historian who helped organize the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s never been done in Latin music. Not for Machito, not Desi Arnaz, not Xavier Cugat.\u201d The festivities handled nearly the full scope of Puente\u2019s career, which spanned well over 100 albums and stretched from the end of World War II to his death in 2000. (The performers appeared to disregard the festival\u2019s rather arbitrary conceit, which suggested, questionably, that Puente had entered a more jazz-influenced phase in 1967.) But, crucially, the proceedings went beyond celebrating one famous man; for three days, and especially on Saturday, the Hostos Center became a site of intergenerational exchange around Latin music culture and practice, with various points of entry. It included a documentary screening, three concerts, discussions and workshops \u2014 aimed at everyone from young children to emerging musicians to older enthusiasts. Mr. Conzo is right: This kind of celebration is rarely given to the city\u2019s Latin music tradition, though it runs nearly as deep in the New York soil as jazz (even if it is not as globally known). The music of East Harlem and the South Bronx in the postwar years represents a creative flush at a time of broad progressive consensus and national economic boom. Like bebop and early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, midcentury mambo and what would eventually become known as salsa will always bear the aspirational residue of their time. Even today, they ring with the inspired resonance of new substances colliding. Tito Puente was born to Puerto Rican parents in 1923 in East Harlem, known as El Barrio. There he learned piano and saxophone and, ultimately, Afro-Cuban percussion. He also absorbed the influence of jazz kit drummers like Gene Krupa, and composers like Duke Ellington. He joined the prominent Cuban bandleader Machito, then \u2014 after a stint in the Navy \u2014 formed his own band. Almost immediately he was headlining at the Palladium Ballroom, Latin music\u2019s haven. Puente, by then, was playing the timbales, the tightly tuned drums that are the sparks on Latin dance music\u2019s skillet. He was among the first timbaleros to add cymbals, and to mount a cowbell high above his drums, letting it reverberate. He incorporated two extra timbales into his set, and relocated, along with his fellow percussionists, to the front of the bandstand. At a time when visual media were proliferating, and musicians were developing a treacherous new primacy over their dancing audiences, Puente moved to re-emphasize the physical spectacle of performance. A big part of Puente\u2019s victory was his simple ability to convey the joy of music through movement: his lunges at the drums, half-athletic and half-exerted; his spin moves; his crisscrossing stick work. A deft arranger, he invested hits like \u201cEl Cayuco\u201d and \u201cCu\u00e1l Es La Idea\u201d with vocal hooks and chattering exchange between the brass and the reed sections, but the Afro-Cuban rhythms held their primacy. In 1955 he was the most prominent American bandleader to release an all-percussion album, initiating a trend. Santana\u2019s 1970 cover of Puente\u2019s \u201cOye Como Va\u201d became a worldwide hit, but it was not until the 1980s and \u201990s that he saw his legacy fully embraced around the world. \u201cHe was surprised by it,\u201d Mr. Conzo said. \u201cHe used to look at the crowds on the road and say, \u2018Who\u2019s playing here?\u2019\u201d At Hostos, attendees of Thursday\u2019s documentary screening and Friday\u2019s concert \u2014 \u201cPuente for a New Generation,\u201d featuring a band of younger musicians playing his older tunes \u2014 were well aware of his regnant status. Most appeared to be longtime listeners with their own memories of the King. But Saturday morning began with a couple of programs aimed at the area\u2019s youngest residents, produced in collaboration with Lincoln Center\u2019s Boro-Linc program. The musician and educator Jadele McPherson led a crowd of about 50 through a basic lesson in Afro-Cuban clave rhythms. Immediately after, the bassist Carlos Henriquez, a curator of the festival, gave an interactive concert. There was a lot of talk last weekend about keeping Mr. Puente\u2019s music alive: his songs, his recordings, his story. But these educational events went beyond that, and they\u2019re what felt loaded with the greatest weight: The music\u2019s raw materials were being handed down to a future generation, as if to clear a path for further development. When people lament the loss of instrumental music among youth, they are not lamenting the passing of a style so much as the changed circumstances of music-making. Well before computers revolutionized pop music, places like the South Bronx had lost many of their arts programs, and with them, access to instruments. (Hostos is the area\u2019s only performing arts center.) And there are ripple effects. On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Madera and Mr. Rodr\u00edguez joined their fellow percussionist Annette Aguilar in hosting a master class. Amateur musicians packed the room, asking questions that rightly belonged at a regular jam session. But there are hardly any venues where Afro-Cuban drumming is performed regularly today. One man in his 30s told Mr. Madera that he did not sense a lack of interest among youngsters. \u201cYou guys, in all honesty, are hard to reach,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere we can find you.\u201d (In an interview that week, Mr. Madera had voiced a similar lament. \u201cThere are no places to play,\u201d he said.) Speaking backstage on Saturday, Mr. Henriquez remembered spending time with Puente as a teenage musician in the Bronx. \u201cHe was a nice guy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe treated me like a fellow musician, very professional. And the longer I lingered, the more I started to see his humor.\u201d In other words, this was a man of global renown who never lost a sense of symbiotic exchange with his hometown. If his influence abides, it will be thanks to initiatives like the one at Hostos, giving children and aficionados the opportunity to learn the basics, commune with elders and experience his music as a catalyst for something else.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/arts/music/tito-puente-50-years-of-el-rey.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T17:20:10-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "Bringing Tito Puente\u2019s Fire to a New Generation", "item_type": "Article"}
