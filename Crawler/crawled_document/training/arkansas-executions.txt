But rulings by several courts have thrown the plan into legal chaos. For updates, follow @alanblinder on Twitter. Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: \u2022 On Saturday, a federal judge in Arkansas, Kristine G. Baker, blocked the state\u2019s execution plan. That order remains in effect. \u2022 The state quickly appealed Judge Baker\u2019s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which is in St. Louis; that court could rule at any time. Any ruling is virtually certain to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for The New York Times, has written about how the court prepares for capital cases. \u2022 An important issue in the courts: whether an execution drug, midazolam, does enough to prevent pain. The drug was developed as a sedative by a team of scientists, including a chemist named Armin Walser. Dr. Walser spoke recently with visible discomfort about how midazolam had been used in executions. \u201cI wish they would not, but if there is no law against it,\u201d he said. \u2022 State officials contend that after years of delays, the men on death row should face their sentences. \u201cAs is oft said, justice delayed is justice denied,\u201d the state attorney general\u2019s office said in a court filing on Monday morning. \u201cNow, the time has come to see that justice done.\u201d \u2022 Before Judge Baker\u2019s decision, rulings by other judges had already resulted in stays of execution for two prisoners. One of those men, Bruce Ward, had been scheduled for execution on Monday. \u2022 If the federal courts lift the stay issued by Judge Baker, the first execution is scheduled for 7 p.m. Central time Monday. It would be the state\u2019s first since 2005. The convicted man, Don Davis, murdered a woman in northwest Arkansas more than 25 years ago. He did not seek executive clemency. Mr. Davis\u2019s case is outlined in this episode of \u201cThe Daily\u201d podcast. \u2022 Some of the most vocal opponents of the death penalty at recent protests in Arkansas had been wrongly on death row themselves. Watch them deliver a petition to the governor\u2019s office. \u2022 McKesson, the nation\u2019s biggest distributor of pharmaceuticals, could return to court to try to block the use of a drug, vecuronium bromide, it sold the state. The company claims the state misled it when purchasing the drug, which is used in lethal injections to stop a prisoner\u2019s breathing. We wrote about the dispute on Saturday. After Judge Baker issued her order, the company asked to withdraw its case, but it said it could go back to court if the executions were allowed to move forward.", "material_type_facet": "News", "abstract": "Court rulings have thrown the state\u2019s plan to execute eight death-row inmates into legal chaos.", "title": "The Arkansas Death Penalty Dispute: Where Things Stand", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/us/arkansas-executions.html", "section": "U.S.", "item_type": "Article"}
