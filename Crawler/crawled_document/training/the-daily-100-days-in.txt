Trump recently said a president should not be judged by his first 100 days. He also said he has accomplished more before that marker than any president in American history. One hundred days. It\u2019s undeniably an arbitrary number. And it\u2019s not very much time. But a lot has happened. On today\u2019s episode: How are voters faring 100 days in? We check back in with past Daily guests: \u2022 David Green, the head of Hobby Lobby, the family-owned craft store chain that took a fight over conservative values all the way to the Supreme Court, and the author of the book \u201cGiving It All Away ... And Getting It All Back Again.\u201d \u2022 Mitch Jacques, a doctor in coal country whose patients hate Obamacare \u2014 but may need it most. \u2022 Mark Napier, a sheriff on the Mexican border, where illegal immigration is part of the landscape. Background reading: \u2022 Circling back to Trump voters, 100 days in. \u2022 Trump wants it known: Grading 100 days is \u2018ridiculous\u2019 (but his were the best).
