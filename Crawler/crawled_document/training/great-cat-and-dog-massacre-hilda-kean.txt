{"text": "THE GREAT CAT AND DOG MASSACRE The Real Story of World War Two\u2019s Unknown Tragedy By Hilda Kean Illustrated. 233 pp. University of Chicago Press. $35. On Sept. 3, 1939, Neville Chamberlain announced on the BBC that Britain had declared war with Germany. In the week that followed, dutiful Britons returned library books, sewed blackout curtains \u2014 and had their pets euthanized. This puzzling national moment, which dispatched a quarter of England\u2019s pet population, is the titular event of Hilda Kean\u2019s \u201cThe Great Cat and Dog Massacre.\u201d Amid protests from government officials and animal charities, and despite the absence of any attack on British soil (the Blitz would not begin until 1940), an estimated 400,000 pets were killed in that first, silent week of war. So many Londoners chose to give their pets \u201cthe gift of sleep\u201d that half-mile-long lines stretched around clinics, causing both a chloroform shortage and a waste management crisis. Though the massacre was publicly lamented at the time, Kean claims it has since been erased from memory. In fact, companion animals rarely appear at all in historical discussions of this, \u201cthe People\u2019s War.\u201d Using source material that includes advertisements, diaries, interviews, letters and editorials, Kean argues the massacre was not the result of a uniform domestic panic. She does point to the \u201cblack boredom\u201d of the days after war was declared, and how mass euthanization was something citizens could do to prepare. But over all, Kean claims, perhaps too vaguely, that there was nothing \u201cmass\u201d about the thinking that led to this slew of pet deaths. Every decision to euthanize emerged from the context of a \u201cparticular prior existing relationship within a household.\u201d Equally specific relationships also led to each decision not to do away with the family cat or dog, a choice made for three-quarters of England\u2019s pet population. Kean says the singularity of these 400,000 decisions marks a key point in the history of Britons interacting with, and awarding agency to, animals. Kean then shifts to those spared pets, whose lives further intertwined with those of humans during the Blitz. Under rationing, the diets of pets and owners blended; cuts of the same horse or whale were rationed for all. A restricted diet prompted interspecies bargaining: A bone from the butcher meant for the dog might get rerouted to its owner\u2019s soup, or a cut of eel sold expressly for human consumption was sneaked into a cat\u2019s dish. In addition to food, \u201cexperiencing bombardment was clearly a joint human-animal activity.\u201d The corrugated iron shelters springing up in Londoners\u2019 yards were new spaces to be simultaneously negotiated. Some animals\u2019 airstrike anxieties kept humans from evacuating to larger public shelters; other humans felt their own fears assuaged by their furry compatriots. Kean makes these claims academically, arguing in the careful \u2014 even downright glacial \u2014 positing of a responsible historian. Still, her snapshots of life during wartime are engaging. In one chapter, a girl describes the sight of her dog\u2019s paws digging away the earth to retrieve her from a buried shelter. In another, a rescued parrot treats its liberator to a run of hilarious obscenities. One woman has her day in court after striking an air raid marshal who banished her pet monkey from a public shelter. Midcentury pet names litter (and light up) the book: Peckle, Chum, Tish and Tosh, Winston Churchill. We meet Marx, George Orwell\u2019s \u201csubdued and uneasy\u201d poodle, named for a philosopher Orwell had not yet read. Many illustrations Kean includes are also telling. One P.S.A. for makeshift earmuffs to be tied, like a toothache hankie, around a dog\u2019s head warns \u201cfew cats will tolerate anything of the kind.\u201d The care expressed in this ad, Kean says, springs not just from observing the suffering of pets, but also from an empathy for a fellow Blitz-weary creature. \u201cI know raids \u2026 drove many dogs mad,\u201d one interview subject notes. \u201cThe war\u2019s done the same thing to everything and everybody.\u201d Kean\u2019s book suggests that history should acknowledge \u201ceverybody\u201d to include bodies with four legs as well as two.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/great-cat-and-dog-massacre-hilda-kean.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T11:28:58-04:00", "abstract": "Hilda Kean\u2019s \u201cThe Great Cat and Dog Massacre\u201d looks at the fate of hundreds of thousands of England\u2019s pets during World War II.", "title": "Keep Calm and Kiss the Cat Goodbye: Mass Pet Euthanization Before the Blitz", "material_type_facet": "Review", "section": "Books", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T11:28:58-04:00"}
