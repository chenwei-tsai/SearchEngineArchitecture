{"text": "OTTAWA \u2014 Kevin O\u2019Leary, a political novice who used the attention he garnered from appearing on reality television shows to become a contender to lead Canada\u2019s Conservative Party, unexpectedly pulled out of the race on Wednesday. During a sometimes chaotic news conference, Mr. O\u2019Leary said he was confident that he would have won the party\u2019s leadership vote. But he said that his failure to attract enough support in Quebec undermined his ability to lead the Conservatives to victory over the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a general election. \u201cI was singularly unsuccessful there for whatever reason,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Leary said of his efforts in Quebec, a province where French is widely spoken. He was criticized for his weak French, and he did not enter the race until January, after the first French-language debate. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to win the leadership if you can\u2019t win the majority mandate.\u201d The effect of Mr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s withdrawal, which occurred hours before the final debate, is difficult to forecast. He has thrown his support to Maxime Bernier, who is quite far to the right for a member of Parliament from Quebec. Earlier in the campaign, Mr. Bernier called Mr. O\u2019Leary \u201ca loser\u201d who had been spending his time \u201cvacationing in Florida, filming in L.A. and shilling on a home shopping channel trying to sell his line of O\u2019Leary wine to American buyers.\u201d But all that was forgotten during the news conference, at which Mr. Bernier declared Mr. O\u2019Leary to be a winner now. \u201cWe had a nice competition and now we are together,\u201d he said. Some polls have shown that Mr. O\u2019Leary and Mr. Bernier were the most popular candidates in what had been a field crowded with 14 candidates until Wednesday. But the leadership voting is open only to people who were paid members of the Conservative Party as of late March, about 260,000 people. The complex ranked ballot and points system they will use to elect the new leader at the end of next month further complicates attempts at predicting the outcome. Adding to the confusion, Mr. O\u2019Leary said he learned on Tuesday night that the ballots had been sent out already, meaning that his name will still appear on them. Mr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s celebrity in Canada first came from his appearances on Dragon\u2019s Den, a reality show in which people pitch their business plans to a panel of investors. Mr. O\u2019Leary, an investor, was known for his bluntness. He still appears on \u201cShark Tank,\u201d a similar American show. Mr. Bernier is not the only Canadian, inside and outside of the Conservative Party, to have noted that Mr. O\u2019Leary spends almost as much time in the United States as in Canada. Mr. O\u2019Leary took time away from the campaign for appearances on \u201cShark Tank\u201d and a trip to Pennsylvania to pitch his line of wines on QVC, a shopping channel. Mr. O\u2019Leary said he would continue to raise money to pay off his campaign debt. Canadian laws prevent him from using his own money for that purpose. He also promised to help Mr. Bernier\u2019s fund-raising efforts.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/canada/canada-kevin-oleary-conservatives.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T20:51:13-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T20:51:13-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. O\u2019Leary said his failure to attract enough support in Quebec undermined his ability to lead the Conservatives to victory over the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.", "title": "Kevin O\u2019Leary, Reality TV Star, Ends Bid to Lead Canada\u2019s Conservatives"}
