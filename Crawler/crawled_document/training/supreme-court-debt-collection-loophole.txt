But the justices did not seem inclined to fill the gap. When Congress enacted the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act in 1977, it imposed strict regulations on firms that collected other companies\u2019 debts. But it did not address the activities of businesses like banks, credit card companies and car dealerships that collect their own debts. That distinction failed to anticipate an increasingly popular business model, in which companies buy distressed debt outright and then try to collect it. \u201cThe industry has evolved in a way that has raised these sorts of questions,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said. \u201cThis is not something that Congress was addressing.\u201d The case, Henson v. Santander Consumer USA, No. 16-349, concerns car loans made by CitiFinancial. At first, Santander Consumer USA serviced the loans, collecting payments and pursuing borrowers who were behind in their payments. Santander later bought CitiFinancial\u2019s defaulted loans outright and started to try to collect. Several borrowers sued, saying Santander had violated the debt collection law by making false statements and by communicating directly with consumers it knew were represented by a lawyer. Santander responded that the law did not apply to it. The main legal question in the case was the meaning of a phrase in the law, which defines a debt collector as one who regularly collected debts \u201cowed or due another.\u201d Kannon K. Shanmugam, a lawyer for Santander, said that \u201cthe sole question presented by this case is whether an entity that purchases debts, and then attempts to collect them for its own account, qualifies as a debt collector\u201d under the law. \u201cThe answer to that question,\u201d he said, \u201cis plainly no.\u201d But Justice Elena Kagan said there was something curious about the case. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much sense, though, does it?\u201d she asked Mr. Shanmugam. \u201cYour client serviced this debt and counted as a debt collector at that time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then your client purchased the debt and all of a sudden is not a debt collector.\u201d \u201cAnd I guess the question is: What happened in between the time when your client serviced the debt and the time when your client purchased the debt that in any way changed its relationship with the borrower such that Congress wouldn\u2019t be concerned any longer with its behavior?\u201d she asked Mr. Shanmugam said his client, as owner of the debt, had different interests than some debt collectors, including keeping a good relationship with customers to whom it might want to sell other products. \u201cI do think,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we would have incentives to maintain their good will in the way that the sort of fly-by-night debt collectors that Congress was seeking to target 40 years ago\u201d did not when it enacted the law. Kevin K. Russell, a lawyer for the borrowers, faced resistance even from justices who might be inclined to be sympathetic to his position. \u201cI can never get it to mean what you want it to mean,\u201d Justice Kagan said of the words of the law. Mr. Russell said his reading of the law avoided some contradictions and superfluous words. But Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the supposed inconsistencies were inconsequential. \u201cYou\u2019re really going uphill on that,\u201d he said. Mr. Russell responded that some of the language in the statute created \u201ca null set\u201d or \u201cVenn diagrams with circles that do not touch.\u201d He gave what he said was a comparable example: \u201cIf Congress has enacted a statute that regulates taxis only to the extent they\u2019re driven by poodles.\u201d But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Congress was allowed some leeway. \u201cNo one writes statutes perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll always under-include or over-include.\u201d The argument was the fifth one for the court\u2019s newest member, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, and the first in which he asked no questions. Mr. Russell concluded his argument by warning that a decision against his clients could allow all debt collectors to avoid regulation under the federal law. \u201cAll they have to do,\u201d he said, \u201cis change their contract with their customer to arrange for a purchasing of the debt that they\u2019ve been hired to collect and arrange to give back 60 percent of what they collect by virtue of that assignment, and they would evade regulation as well.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/politics/supreme-court-debt-collection-loophole.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T15:58:42-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Justices Appear Reluctant to Close Debt Collection Loophole", "created_date": "2017-04-18T15:58:42-04:00", "section": "U.S."}
