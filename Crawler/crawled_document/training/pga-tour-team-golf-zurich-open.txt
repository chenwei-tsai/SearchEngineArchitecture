{"text": "AVONDALE, La. \u2014 On April 19, 2016, Andy Pazder was sipping a cup of coffee, reading the sports page and soaking in the ocean view just a few miles from PGA Tour headquarters in Florida when the idea struck him. He wanted to shake up the format of the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, a tour staple since 1938. In that moment of inspiration, Pazder, the tour\u2019s chief tournaments and competitions officer, thought about switching the Classic from a traditional stroke-play event to a two-man team event. He fired off a text at 6:12 a.m. explaining his idea to Jay Monahan, who in November would be promoted to tour commissioner. Then he looked up the website of the title sponsor, Zurich Insurance Group, which listed teamwork among the company\u2019s core values. \u201cIt was like a gift,\u201d Pazder said. Pazder\u2019s idea required the approval of the title sponsor and of the tour\u2019s board of directors, and it received universal support. During the initial discussion with the tour\u2019s 16-member Player Advisory Council, Pazder said, \u201cthere were guys looking to pair up on the spot.\u201d With the new format, the Zurich Classic seems to have been jolted by enthusiasm. Six of the top 10 players in the rankings and 13 of the top 25 signed up to play this week. During the post-Masters hangover the past two weeks, none of the players then in the top 15 competed in the RBC Heritage, and only one played in the Texas Open. The Zurich Classic will feature 80 two-man teams, with those posting the top 35 cumulative scores (and ties) playing through the weekend. Alternate-shot play will be used in the first and third rounds, and best-ball in the second and fourth, with only the lowest score posted by a team member on each hole applied to the cumulative total. The closest the tour has previously come to using a foursome format in an official event was at the 1934 Pinehurst Pro-Pro held at Pinehurst\u2019s No. 2. Each player on the winning team will get credit for a victory for the first time since Vance Heafner and Mike Holland combined to win the Walt Disney World National Team Championship in 1981. The winning team will be awarded a two-year tour exemption, 400 FedEx Cup points and invitations to the Players Championship next month, the P.G.A. Championship in August and the Tournament of Champions in January. But the winning tandem will not earn Masters berths or any ranking points. The PGA is not the only tour to embrace team golf this season. The European Tour\u2019s commissioner, Keith Pelley, has shown a willingness to think differently, including the addition of night events and music on the first tee. His latest brainchild, GolfSixes, which consists of six-hole matches, will make its debut on May 6 and 7 at the Centurion Club north of London. Two-man teams from 16 different countries will compete for a purse of 1 million euros. \u201cWe have said for some time that golf needs to modernize, and introducing innovative new formats is a major part of achieving that aim,\u201d Pelley said in a statement this year. \u201cWe are in the entertainment content business with golf as our platform, and GolfSixes is the perfect illustration of that.\u201d Team golf is not a novel concept. Among other events, the biennial Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup competitions use team play, as does the PGA Tour Champions Legends of Golf, which was held for the 39th time last week. All told, the tour has held 61 previous official team events, using various formats. The tour also recognizes two nontraditional events, the World Golf Championships match-play tournament and the Barracuda Championship, which uses a modified Stableford format, allocating points based on the number of strokes taken at each hole, with the goal of achieving the highest overall score. Should there be more breaks with tradition? It depends whom you ask. Jordan Spieth campaigned for a couple of more breaks from the monotony of 72-hole stroke play, while Justin Rose supported the philosophy of \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that 72-hole stroke play is the purest form of the game, and that\u2019s how you often get the best champion and the truest winner,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThat should be protected, I think, for the most part. \u201cThere were gaps on the European Tour schedule where there were opportunities to do something different and strengthen weaker tournaments by creating more fun and excitement around them. I think they\u2019ve done a great job of identifying those tournaments. But they\u2019re not messing with the strong tournaments on the European Tour.\u201d This week, Spieth will play with his fellow Texan Ryan Palmer after losing a golf bet in November with Palmer\u2019s caddie, James Edmondson, a former college golfer. There also are pairings of brothers (Brooks and Chase Koepka), Ryder Cup teammates (Rose and Henrik Stenson) and college teammates (the local favorites John Peterson and Andrew Loupe from Louisiana State, Georgia\u2019s Harris English and Hudson Swafford and Georgia Tech\u2019s Ollie Schniederjans and Richy Werenski, to name a few). The highest-profile team is Jason Day and Rickie Fowler. For some, securing a partner has been akin to finding a prom date. Asked to explain in up to three words why he had chosen Luke Donald as his partner, Jamie Lovemark counted on his hand while saying, \u201cDes-per-ation.\u201d Bubba Watson, who is playing with J. B. Holmes, said: \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter how they partner up. They\u2019re going to be buddies for a couple days, and you\u2019re going to see a lot of smiles, a lot of laughing and a lot of enjoyment of the game of golf.\u201d The NBC golf analyst Peter Jacobsen played on two Ryder Cup teams for the United States and was Arnold Palmer\u2019s partner as host of the Fred Meyer Challenge, an unofficial team event held from 1986 to 2002. Jacobsen described the team format as twice the pleasure, but also twice the pain. \u201cIt\u2019s so uplifting when you make a birdie for your partner,\u201d he said, \u201cbut also agonizing when you miss a putt that costs you and your partner a hole.\u201d The new team format brings a different strategy and intrigue to the decision-making process, which explains why so many players are talking about the importance of team chemistry and complementing each other\u2019s game. That could be either a blessing or a burden for the Koepkas. \u201cWe could kill each other on the second hole,\u201d Brooks Koepka said, \u201cor it could be awesome.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/sports/golf/pga-tour-team-golf-zurich-open.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T21:34:45-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T21:34:45-04:00", "abstract": "A tour staple since 1938, the event has switched from a traditional stroke-play event to a two-man team format as a way to increase player and fan interest.", "title": "Zurich Open Turns to Team Play as a Jolt to PGA Tour Routine"}
