Even with excisions, Asch\u2019s work was still deemed so morally offensive that it was shut down by the police six weeks after it opened at the Apollo Theater on 42nd Street. Almost a century later, no whiff of scandal or self-censorship attends Rebecca Taichman\u2019s production of Ms. Vogel\u2019s thoughtful evocation of the life and times of \u201cGod of Vengeance,\u201d which opened on Tuesday night at the Cort Theater. First staged last year at the Vineyard Theater, \u201cIndecent\u201d arrives on Broadway as one of the season\u2019s most respectable \u2014 and respectful \u2014 plays. Yes, that notorious scene that never made it to the main stem, even in the licentious Jazz Age, is fully rendered here \u2014 and not just once but in an assortment of fuguelike variations, performed with grace by Ms. Lenk and Adina Verson. The dominant note of this erotic encounter isn\u2019t prurience, though; it\u2019s piety. \u201cIndecent\u201d is, above all, decent, in the most complete sense of the word. It is virtuous, sturdily assembled, informative and brimming with good faith. The territory it covers in its one hour and 45 minutes is immense. \u201cIndecent\u201d presents a thorough history of Asch\u2019s masterwork, from its inception in Warsaw in 1907 to the World War II era, when it was performed as an act of artistic affirmation in an attic in the Lodz ghetto of German-occupied Poland. What\u2019s more, \u201cIndecent\u201d delivers not only a history of styles of theater and their political contexts but also a portrait of Asch (played by Max Gordon Moore and Tom Nelis), as he progresses from youthful enthusiasm to embittered old age. This is achieved by a tight ensemble of chameleon performers \u2014 who also include Mimi Lieber and Steven Rattazzi and the musicians Matt Darriau, Lisa Gutkin and Aaron Halva \u2014 glowing with devotion to their craft and its possibilities. Yet the ardor that must have informed the writing and early performances of \u201cVengeance\u201d only occasionally blazes forth in \u201cIndecent,\u201d which was created by Ms. Vogel and Ms. Taichman. Both women have described being deeply affected by their discovery of Asch\u2019s play in their youth. And you can sense how seriously they take their responsibilities as 21st-century curators of its reputation. Such conscientiousness has its downside. For all its resourceful stagecraft \u2014 which includes the fluent use of period and original pastiche song (overseen by Ms. Gutkin and Mr. Halva) and dance (by David Dorfman) \u2014 \u201cIndecent\u201d can be deflatingly earnest in its dialogue and timeline exposition. The production begins with grave lyricism, with the suitcase-toting ensemble seated upstage, clad in earthen hues that blend into the shadows. (Emily Rebholz did the costumes, and the black-hole-of-history set is by Riccardo Hernandez.) When they rise, they shake cascades of ashes from their sleeves, a haunting evocation of a past of persecution and flight. Such dreamlike images abound in \u201cIndecent,\u201d which has been artfully lighted by Christopher Akerlind and features projections by Tal Yarden, which orient us as to the time, place and language spoken in the scenes that follow. Much of the emotional focus is provided by our narrator, Lemml (a sweetly somber Richard Topol), Asch\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and stage manager. \u201cWe have a story we want to tell you,\u201d he says to us, as an onstage surrogate of sorts for Ms. Vogel and Ms. Taichman. \u201cA story about a play. A play that changed my life.\u201d And what a play it turned out to be! Written by Asch when he was in his 20s, \u201cVengeance\u201d told the story of a bourgeois brothel owner (played by the great Yiddish theater actor Joseph Schildkraut, here embodied by Mr. Nelis) whose daughter falls in love with one of his whores. Not only did \u201cVengeance\u201d present a physical relationship between women as natural and even purifying, but it also concluded with a desecration of the Torah by Mr. Schildkraut\u2019s character. Small wonder that the Warsaw literary circle to whom Asch first introduced his play urged him to burn it. Asch speaks of the necessity of Jews\u2019 showing \u201courselves as flawed and complex human beings.\u201d One of his actresses in New York says: \u201cWe are the first generation that gets the chance our parents never got. To tell our stories.\u201d \u201cIndecent\u201d is not shy about explicitly stating and repeating its big themes. Though the hard-working performers change characters often, their dialogue remains much the same. And there is little room for the subversive pull of conflicting subtext, of which Ms. Vogel has made adroit use in other works, including her Pulitzer Prize winner of 20 years ago, \u201cHow I Learned to Drive.\u201d Her latest show is most moving when it approaches its material sideways. The musical numbers summon entire cultural climates with atmospheric efficiency. Tableaus like those of people waiting anxiously in line \u2014 first at Ellis Island and later in a concentration camp \u2014 echo with quiet impact. And that fabled scene in the rain, though perhaps repeated once too often, captures the ecstatic sense of wonder that Ms. Vogel has described feeling in reading \u201cVengeance\u201d for the first time. \u201cIndecent,\u201d a major playwright\u2019s long-awaited Broadway debut, may not inhabit the lightning-struck stratosphere of the play it portrays. But it offers heartening evidence that four decades in the theater have not jaded Ms. Vogel. \u201cSuch fresh energy and sincerity,\u201d the Schildkraut of \u201cIndecent\u201d marvels after meeting the young Asch. The same might be said of Ms. Vogel, who transmits the theater-struck sense of wonder of the girl who first read \u201cGod of Vengeance.\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
