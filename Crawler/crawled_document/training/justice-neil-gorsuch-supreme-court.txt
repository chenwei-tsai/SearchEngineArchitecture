The new member of the court, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, sat on the far right side of the bench, in the spot reserved for the most junior justice. If Justice Gorsuch experienced first-day jitters, he did not betray them. He was an exceptionally active questioner, displaying an easy familiarity with the issues in the minor and technical cases before the court. He asked crisp and colloquial questions, and he kept asking them if he did not find the lawyers\u2019 answers satisfactory. There was no acknowledgment inside the courtroom of the bitter fight that led up to the seating of the new justice. But his presence was noted by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at the start of the day. \u201cBefore we commence the business of the court this morning, it gives me great pleasure on behalf of myself and my colleagues to welcome Justice Gorsuch as the 101st associate justice of this court,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said. \u201cJustice Gorsuch, we wish you a long and happy career in our common calling.\u201d Justice Gorsuch responded cordially. \u201cThank you to each of my new colleagues for the very warm welcome I received this last week,\u201d he said. \u201cI appreciate it very much.\u201d About 10 minutes into the first argument, Justice Gorsuch asked a half-dozen questions in a row. The case, about where Civil Service and discrimination claims may be filed, was \u201cunbelievably complicated,\u201d as Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. noted. \u201cWho wrote this statute?\u201d Justice Alito asked. \u201cSomeone who takes pleasure in pulling wings off of flies?\u201d But Justice Gorsuch approached the case with relish, and he made what is likely to become one of his signature points, that the court\u2019s job is limited to reading the words of the statute under review. \u201cLooking at the plain words of the statute,\u201d he told a lawyer, Christopher Landau. \u201cJust help me with that.\u201d Justice Gorsuch grew a little self-conscious as he kept pressing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for taking up so much time,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologize.\u201d Later, when Mr. Landau started reading the statutory text, Justice Gorsuch said, \u201cKeep going. Keep going.\u201d Mr. Landau said his client was \u201cnot asking the court to break any new ground\u201d by interpreting the statute to allow some filings. Justice Gorsuch agreed, in a way. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cjust to continue to make things up.\u201d Toward the end of the first argument, Justice Gorsuch returned to his basic theme. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a lot easier if we just followed the plain text of the statute?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d In the day\u2019s second argument, on standards for standing, he praised one lawyer and gently chided another. After Sarah E. Harrington, a lawyer for the federal government, acknowledged the strength of her adversary\u2019s position on one point, Justice Gorsuch said, \u201cI appreciate the candor of that concession.\u201d But Justice Gorsuch pressed another lawyer, Shay Dvoretzky, for a more precise response to his question. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for interrupting, counsel,\u201d Justice Gorsuch said. \u201cIf you\u2019d just answer my question, I\u2019d be grateful.\u201d Mr. Dvoretzky\u2019s next attempt did not seem to satisfy Justice Gorsuch, either. \u201cI\u2019ll let you go,\u201d the justice said, giving up."}
