{"text": "BERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany warned Britain on Thursday not to harbor \u201cillusions\u201d that it can negotiate a deal on future relations with the European Union while simultaneously negotiating its departure from the bloc. Future relations can be negotiated only after the terms of the exit have been agreed upon, Ms. Merkel told Germany\u2019s Parliament on Thursday. \u201cI have the feeling that some people in Britain still have illusions on this score,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be a waste of time.\u201d Ms. Merkel was not more specific, but as a leader known for choosing her words carefully, her warning about the high costs of leaving Europe could interpreted as a subtle message for voters in France, Britain and Germany itself. She did not mention the May 7 presidential runoff election in France, though she and other European leaders have made clear that they back the independent centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, a pro-European Union former banker and economy minister, over the far-right populist and nationalist politician Marine Le Pen, who has threatened to try to pull France out of the European Union and the euro currency. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a specific Macron thing,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. Europe\u2019s message to France would have been the same if the defeated center-right candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, were to face Ms. Le Pen instead of Mr. Macron, he said. Mr. Wolff added, however, that European leaders should also be leery of overemphasizing the costs of abandoning Europe. \u201cThat is a very precarious message, which ultimately will not work,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cYou cannot sell Europe on the feeling that leaving is painful.\u201d It is customary for Ms. Merkel to go before Parliament ahead of important European meetings to outline her stance. On Saturday, leaders of the 27 countries that will remain in the European Union after Britain leaves are scheduled to discuss their negotiating position with Britain. Britain, in turn, will hold an early election on June 8 that Prime Minister Theresa May has called to try to get a stronger mandate for her Conservative Party before the negotiations. In reality, however, talks between Britain and Europe might not become seriously detailed until Germany holds its own elections \u2014 in which Ms. Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union will seek a fourth mandate from voters \u2014 in late September. On Thursday, Ms. Merkel emphasized that Europe had pulled together in the 10 months since British voters narrowly approved departure from the bloc, a process known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d in June. \u201cThere is great agreement about our common negotiating position towards Britain\u201d after talks in recent weeks with other leaders, she said. \u201cWe can thus assume that the council of the 27 will send a strong signal of unity.\u201d An outsider country \u201ccannot enjoy the same or even better rights than a member of the European Union,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. Mr. Wolff, a German, noted that, over all, Ms. Merkel stuck to her usual practice of broad statements so that she could finesse the outcome as time goes on. That reflects her desire to maintain good relations with Britain \u2014 particularly on security issues and trade \u2014 and to avoid \u201ca break that leads to major disruptions,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThe one point where she was very clear, and very strict, was that we first have to finish the negotiations on the terms of exit itself, and only then talk about future relations.\u201d Sylke Tempel of the German Council on Foreign Relations said Saturday\u2019s meeting, scheduled some weeks ago, was \u201cpurposely timed\u201d to fall between the two rounds of the French election. As things stand, it thus has the effect of backing Mr. Macron, who leaders in Germany believe \u201cwould be the better result, also for most of the French,\u201d she said. Ms. Merkel has stuck to her message since the British referendum: that the remaining 27 countries agree on basics, especially the freedom of movement that Britons blame for what many of them see as mass immigration, and that everything else can be negotiated. \u201cMerkel has said the same, but perhaps a little bit clearer now,\u201d Ms. Tempel said. \u201cIt is easier when you know you have people on board.\u201d There is general agreement that a country \u201cshould be a bit less comfortable outside than inside\u201d the European Union, she added. Like Mrs. May herself, Britain is often described as pragmatic and taking a cleareyed, unsentimental approach toward the coming divorce negotiations. But Germany, too, is pragmatic, Ms. Tempel said \u2014 in its insistence on working within the European framework. \u201cThat is a conviction, and not a tactic,\u201d she said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/europe/angela-merkel-germany-britain-brexit.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T11:57:56-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T11:57:56-04:00", "abstract": "The chancellor said that Britain must negotiate its departure from the European Union before discussing future relations.", "title": "Merkel Warns Britain Against \u2018Illusions\u2019 About Post-\u2018Brexit\u2019 Ties"}
