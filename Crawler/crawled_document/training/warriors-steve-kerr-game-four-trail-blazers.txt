Kerr stayed behind at the team hotel for Saturday night\u2019s Game 3 at Portland\u2019s Moda Center. Mike Brown, an assistant coach, took Kerr\u2019s place, and the Warriors overcame a 17-point first-half deficit to win, 119-113, and go up 3-0 in the first-round series. Golden State can sweep with a victory on Monday night. Kerr, the reigning N.B.A. coach of the year, still experiences lingering symptoms from two back operations he had after the franchise\u2019s run to the 2015 championship. He missed the first 43 games last season dealing with symptoms such as headaches, nausea and an aching neck. Kerr, who clearly was not feeling well on Friday before the team departed for Portland, had not missed a game this season before Saturday, when he also missed the team\u2019s shootaround. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been dealing with, but doing O.K.,\u201d Kerr said Sunday. \u201cUps and downs but consistently coaching. This past week for whatever reason, things got worse. My symptoms got worse.\u201d He said that his status for the rest of the playoffs remained uncertain. He was in ongoing discussions with his doctors. \u201cThis is not going to be a case where I\u2019m coaching one night and not coaching the next,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that to our team or our staff. We\u2019re hoping that over the next week or two, whatever it is, I can sort of make a definitive realization or deduction, or just feel it that I\u2019m going to do this or I\u2019m not.\u201d Stephen Curry, who scored 34 points in the Game 3 win, passed the game ball to Golden State General Manager Bob Myers to give to Kerr on Saturday night. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously going through a lot physically and that\u2019s first and foremost for him to take care of himself, make sure he\u2019s on the road to recovery and feeling like himself,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got his back, we\u2019ve had certain situations all year, previous years, where players are down and you\u2019ve got the \u2018next man up\u2019 philosophy, same with Coach Kerr.\u201d A first-year assistant for Golden State, Brown has plenty of experience as the former head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers. In the first of two stints with Cleveland, Brown led the Cavs to their first N.B.A. finals appearance in 2007. He was named the league\u2019s coach of the year in 2009 when Cleveland finished with 66 wins. Despite Kerr\u2019s prolonged absence, the Warriors went 73-9 last season, a record, and played in the finals. Kerr was named Coach of the Year. Kerr works out daily and does yoga to help control the symptoms. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into details on the symptoms,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s just discomfort and pain and it\u2019s no fun. And I can tell you if you\u2019re listening out there, if you have a back problem, stay away from surgery. I can say that from the bottom of my heart. Rehab, rehab, rehab. Don\u2019t let anybody get in there.\u201d The Warriors could also be without Kevin Durant in Game 4 because of a strained left calf. Durant has missed Golden State\u2019s last two games against the Blazers because of the injury, which occurred in the third quarter of last Sunday\u2019s Game 1 victory against the Trail Blazers. He had 32 points and 10 rebounds in the Game 1 win.", "abstract": "Kerr still has lingering symptoms from two back operations he had after the team won the 2015 championship."}
