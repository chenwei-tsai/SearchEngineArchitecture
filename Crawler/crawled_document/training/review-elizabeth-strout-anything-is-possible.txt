Certainly Olive Kitteridge, the protagonist of Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, knew this. \u201cPleasure is the absence of pain,\u201d Olive thought to herself at one point, recalling the words of a philosopher she\u2019d read in college. (She couldn\u2019t remember who. Epicurus.) She may as well have been speaking for any of Strout\u2019s characters. The things they carry are heavy. Not to suffer would be more than enough. And oh, how the characters suffer in Strout\u2019s latest novel, \u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d! The title seems a mean joke, given the book\u2019s army of hurting men and women, desperate for liberation from their wounds. To describe the plot, to the extent that there even is one, is pointless. Like \u201cOlive Kitteridge,\u201d \u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d is really a necklace of short stories about people in a small town, studded with clues about who\u2019s connected to whom. (Strout was born to be an omniscient narrator, born to flit and swoop from one crooked perch to the next.) It is most useful to think about Strout\u2019s work thematically. The same ideas continually preoccupy her, and her characters often behave in similar ways. They indulge in the petty comforts of gossip, their judgments disguised as concern, their desperation to reassure themselves of their luck \u2014 and virtue \u2014 disguised as pity. They throb with loneliness and fume with disappointment. (A lot of her characters are old, very old, and are bitter to discover where they have ended up.) Grown children defend parents who had done the indefensible, their mercy almost saintly in its bounty; or they do its opposite, clinging to righteous fury over parental infractions on a more human scale, driving their mothers wild with grief and remorse. And many characters walk around with great satchels of unexpressed love. \u201cBecause he was Charlie and not someone else,\u201d Strout writes of Charlie Macauley, a damaged Vietnam veteran, \u201che could not say to his son: You are decent and strong, and none of this has anything to do with me; but you came through it, that childhood that wasn\u2019t all roses, and I\u2019m proud of you, I\u2019m amazed by you.\u201d Where this book sharply departs from Strout\u2019s previous work is in its frank, unapologetic emphasis on forbidden desire. Not a chapter spins by, practically, without the unveiling of some sexual secret. There are stories of voyeurism. Prostitution. A father\u2019s secret gay life. We discover, to our horror, that the husband of one of the most tender, largehearted characters, Patty Nicely, was repeatedly raped as a child. When she was a child, Patty herself walked in on her mother in flagrante delicto \u2014 with Patty\u2019s Spanish teacher, who was spanking her. \u201cHer mother could not stop herself from wailing,\u201d Strout writes, \u201cthis is what Patty saw, her mother\u2019s breasts and her mother\u2019s eyes looking at her \u2014 yet unable to stop what was coming from her mouth.\u201d The trauma of the primal scene, which may or may not involve both parents, is central in \u201cAnything Is Possible.\u201d It misshapes the psychosexual futures of many innocents. The best they can hope for in adulthood is not to recapitulate the crimes that were done to them. So where, you might ask, is the relief in such a book? \u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d is certainly more grim than Strout\u2019s previous work. It\u2019s more audacious, too, and more merciless, daring you to walk away. \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d assumes a mythic status among some of its characters. This book is its terrible opposite. No chirping families to be found among the swaying golden fields here. But the writing is wrenchingly lovely. It almost always is with Strout, whether she\u2019s knitting metaphors or summarizing, with agonizing economy, whole episodes of a life: \u201cHaving met in their late thirties, they\u2019d had only eight years together. No children. Patty had never known a better man.\u201d You read Strout, really, for the same reason you listen to a requiem: to experience the beauty in sadness. For those who have read Strout\u2019s previous novel, \u201cMy Name Is Lucy Barton,\u201d this book also offers the pleasures of intertextual sport. \u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d takes place in Amgash, Ill., the town of Lucy\u2019s birth. Though readers never actually went there \u2014 we only heard tales of it from Lucy\u2019s mother, who prattled on about its beleaguered residents during a hospital visit with Lucy in New York \u2014 this new novel still feels like a homecoming of sorts, with familiar-sounding characters now earning chapters of their own. Like the \u201cPretty Nicely Girls,\u201d whose mother\u2019s affair liquidated the family. And Charlie Macauley, whose experience in Vietnam liquidated his soul. And of course, the Bartons. The meta conceit of \u201cMy Name Is Lucy Barton,\u201d which the reader only realizes partway in, is that the novel is meant to be the actual \u201cpublished\u201d memoir of Lucy, its author-narrator. \u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d is sly, too. Characters in the town of Amgash purchase Lucy\u2019s book at the local bookstore; they quote from it; they make note of its cover (which looks like the real-life cover of \u201cMy Name Is Lucy Barton\u201d). But the most startling thing the reader discovers in this book is that \u201cLucy Barton\u201d wasn\u2019t the whole truth. You may think, having read it, that you know the Barton family. Trust me: You don\u2019t. Those children suffered cruelty of an astounding magnitude, far worse than Strout originally conveyed. That their father couldn\u2019t stop diddling himself in their presence, and on the job, is only the half of it. It was their mother who inflicted the most harm. Lucy was holding out on us \u2014 possibly willfully, or possibly because the complete truth, half-glimpsed, was all her adult self could tolerate. But her siblings have fuller memories. Her sister in particular can cite chapter and verse of her mother\u2019s crimes. \u201cYou want truthful sentences?\u201d she asks in the new novel, after a noisome litany of them rolls off her tongue. \u201cWrite about that.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to write that story,\u201d Lucy replies. \u201cAnd who\u2019d want to read it?\u201d asks her brother. We would.
