Had to Go", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-17T16:07:12-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "The Arconic board should have fired its chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, long ago. Under his watch, Alcoa and Arconic have underperformed their rivals.", "text": "Arconic\u2019s board can at least thank Klaus Kleinfeld for a brief reprieve. Mr. Kleinfeld, the chairman and chief executive of Arconic, the Alcoa spinoff that makes specialty parts for cars and airplanes, stepped down on Monday for inappropriately writing a letter to an activist shareholder. That saves Arconic\u2019s directors from having to fire him. But they will still have to answer for why they didn\u2019t do that long ago. Over the past nine years running Alcoa and then Arconic, Mr. Kleinfeld has been a poor steward of investors\u2019 booty. The companies suffered for years from industry overcapacity and a sharp drop in aluminum prices. Mr. Kleinfeld expanded into engineered parts with high-priced acquisitions. In November, he split the outfit, leaving behind the legacy aluminum business under the Alcoa name and taking charge of the newly named Arconic. News of his exit on Monday won $400 million worth of applause from the market, which raised Arconic\u2019s capitalization to $11.8 billion. But that barely begins to compensate for the nearly $16 billion in value that Alcoa lost on Mr. Kleinfeld\u2019s watch. Nor did changing names alter Arconic\u2019s fortunes. The firm had an operating margin of just 6.6 percent last year, more than four points below the sector average. Its engineered-products division generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, margins about seven percentage points below those of its rival Precision Castparts before Berkshire Hathaway bought that company last year. And net debt of 3.25 times Ebitda is more than double the sector average, weighing on the company in an environment of rising interest rates. Elliott Management, the hedge fund that won three board seats last year, is pressing for four more nominees and a strategy overhaul to ditch Arconic\u2019s costly New York headquarters, slash middle management and focus investment on high-return businesses. Such changes would enable the company to increase Ebitda margins to 20 percent in 2020 from a forecast 16.5 percent this year, Elliott contends. Although it showed Mr. Kleinfeld the door for \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in contacting Elliott without authorization, the company reaffirmed its support of his strategy. It also suggested that Elliott should drop its \u201chighly disruptive and distracting proxy fight\u201d now that Mr. Kleinfeld, its main target, is gone. But with Mr. Kleinfeld\u2019s strategy in place \u2014 and a history of supporting their flawed chief executive \u2014 Arconic\u2019s directors are still in Elliott\u2019s cross hairs.", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00"}
