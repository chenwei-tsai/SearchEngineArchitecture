Last week, a 24-year-old Saudi woman, Dina Ali Lasloom, tried to flee her home for Australia. Members of her family flew to Manila, a transit stop, and forced her to return to Saudi Arabia. But before she was hauled away, she posted a cellphone video, saying that her family would kill her and begging for help. The video quickly went viral in Saudi Arabia. Another woman, Alla Anazi, a medical student, was detained at the Riyadh airport after she asked the authorities when Ms. Lasloom\u2019s flight was landing. Protesters had been alerted on Twitter and gathered to support Ms. Lasloom. And this week, a women\u2019s rights activist, Maryam Al-Otaibi, was arrested after she fled her father\u2019s home to live independently in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Fellow activists were soon spreading news of her case on social media sites. The three cases are part of a campaign by Saudi women, who have been broadcasting daring videos with their cellphones, using Facebook to organize street protests and posting Twitter messages to challenge the very idea of male supremacy in their famously patriarchal society. The campaign, started by a loose network of activists who have enlisted young, media-savvy women, has gone far beyond earlier protests against the kingdom\u2019s reaffirmed ban on female drivers, and has become a challenge to the pervasive guardianship system. In this entrenched system of guardianship, a male relative \u2014 usually a father or a husband, but sometimes a brother or even a son \u2014 has the legal right to control a woman\u2019s movements. What use is the right to drive, the young activists ask, if a woman still needs a man\u2019s permission to leave the house? Even among some of the activists themselves, there has been surprise at the response. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed; a few years ago I thought I was the only one who thought this way,\u201d said Moudi al-Johani, 26, a Saudi woman who said she was locked up by her family when she returned from Florida during a college vacation. Ms. Johani\u2019s father was angered by her independence and held her at home against her will for months, she said. She fled last year to the United States, where she has applied for asylum. She was among those who started an online campaign, #StopEnslavingSaudiWomen, which she claimed \u201chas been trending for more than 230 days.\u201d The online Saudi activists have at times been provocative, with a number of women apparently within Saudi Arabia posting photographs and videos of themselves online after removing their head scarves and hijabs, often in public. While that would not earn more than a glance in most Muslim societies, in Saudi Arabia these women risk arrest by the religious police, who enforce the kingdom\u2019s ultrastrict, Wahhabi version of Islam. In one Twitter post, a woman held a sign in front of her face: \u201cI\u2019m a prisoner and my crime is that I\u2019m a Saudi women.\u201d Others have recorded themselves performing other acts considered forbidden: driving cars, riding bicycles, wearing trousers. In the case of Ms. Lasloom, who was trying to reach Australia without her father\u2019s permission, the Saudi authorities asked Philippine officials to detain her while her uncles flew to Manila. Before they arrived, she borrowed a phone from a Canadian woman at the airport and recorded her plea for help. \u201cIf my family come, they will kill me,\u201d she said in the cellphone recording. \u201cIf I go back to Saudi Arabia, I will be dead.\u201d According to Human Rights Watch, a security official in Manila reported seeing her being taken away with her mouth taped shut and her arms and legs bound with tape. She was put on a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight home with her uncles. Ms. Lasloom\u2019s video quickly went viral in the Middle East, under the hashtag #SaveDinaAli. The Saudi Embassy in Manila issued a statement calling Ms. Lasloom\u2019s return a \u201cfamily matter.\u201d The Philippine authorities denied returning her against her will. \u201cCases like Dina\u2019s case are the direct result of a system that keeps women in a perpetual state of being a minor,\u201d said Ahmed Benchemsi, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. In his Vision 2030 decree last year, Saudi Arabia\u2019s powerful new defense minister and deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, called for a more open society. He said that women were an important part of that society and should be allowed to play a greater role. One of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms was to rein in the religious police, sharply curtailing their powers in recent months, which is one of the reasons women are starting to speak up more now. Moreover, women who campaigned for greater rights in the 1990s did not have the sort of internet tools now so widely available to activists, said a Saudi historian and women\u2019s activist, Hatoon al-Fasi. \u201cWe are witnessing a different phenomenon today where more young women are becoming outspoken about deciding their own fates, and going public with it,\u201d Ms. Fasi said. But activists are quick to note that the social media uprising does not necessarily represent what all Saudi women are feeling. \u201cThere are a lot of indicators on both sides,\u201d Mr. Benchemsi said. \u201cYou also have religious preachers with millions of followers on social media, so you see some signs of a loosening, but you also see signs of the opposite.\u201d Ms. Johani said that since fleeing last year, her activism has attracted many other young women who want to free themselves from their male relatives. \u201cI get tens of messages every day from Saudi women trying to seek help,\u201d she said, \u201cand every day they literally ask me, \u2018How did you manage, how can we get help?\u2019\u201d But she also gets plenty of hate mail and death threats, she said, from both men and women.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T11:09:59-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-male-guardianship-activists-social-media.html", "item_type": "Article"}
