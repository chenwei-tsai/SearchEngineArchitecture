Northern Democrats visiting the place in April 1860 for their party\u2019s national convention would have demurred. Democrats had settled on Charleston in order to mollify Southern members and ensure a united front heading into the fall presidential election. The opposite occurred. Southern disunionists, emboldened by galleries packed with supporters, rigged the convention to split the Democratic Party \u2014 the only national party competing that year. The breakup would inevitably result in the election of the yet-to-be-named Republican candidate. A Republican victory, the radicals theorized, would galvanize white Southerners to form a new nation secure from the economic predations and racial terror that the new administration would inevitably unleash upon the South if the slave states remained in the Union. \u201cMadness Rules the Hour,\u201d Paul Starobin\u2019s fast-paced, engagingly written account of the hysteria that descended on lovely Charleston \u2014 where the unthinkable became the inevitable \u2014 is as much a study in group psychology as it is in history. Charleston\u2019s course to secession a mere seven weeks after the election of Lincoln and more than two months before he took office was not a willy-nilly, mob-inspired dash to disunion, but rather a well-orchestrated movement (controlled chaos, if you will), extending from John Brown\u2019s raid on Harpers Ferry in October 1859 to the fateful Secession Convention in late December 1860 that took South Carolina out of the Union. The conductors of this movement were the city\u2019s elite, whom Starobin presents in finely drawn portraits. Mobilizing the news media, especially the widely read Charleston Mercury (even Lincoln was a subscriber), staging boisterous military displays and mass meetings, and establishing secessionist organizations, the disunionists advanced their cause. If you were not with them, you remained silent. The elite ensured solidarity with the white working class by tightening restrictions on the city\u2019s free black population, many of whom fled. Secession was not a new fever in Charleston in 1860. Agitation had flared before: in 1832 in opposition to an allegedly punitive tariff, and in 1850 in the midst of the debate on the admission of California as a free state and related issues. But as Starobin notes, the itch to leave the Union was hardly a widely shared view elsewhere in the South, neither on those earlier occasions nor even in 1860. Why was Charleston so in advance of its neighbors? Starobin, the author of \u201cAfter America: Narratives for the Next Global Age,\u201d does not precisely answer this question, but part of the explanation lies scattered in his book. Charleston was one of the most prosperous cities in the country, a major port and a center for the lucrative Sea Islands cotton trade. But its economy was beginning to ebb, as ports to the north eclipsed the city. And a Republican regime that promoted economic nationalism would surely enrich its friends and beggar its enemies. Charlestonians viewed the Republicans as an existential threat not only to their livelihood, but also to their lives. Disunion was an opportunity to regain sovereignty, prosperity and security. Honor, the history of secession agitation and the memory of the failed Vesey slave rebellion of 1822 also figured into the equation. But, as Starobin concludes his story, the equation blew up. Fast-forward to April 1865, and the ruins of this once beautiful city stood as testimony to folly. He appropriately leaves the coda to the Union general William Tecumseh Sherman: \u201cAnyone who is not satisfied with war should go and see Charleston, and he will pray louder and deeper than ever that the country may, in the long future, be spared any more war.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T07:00:23-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/madness-rules-the-hour-civil-war-paul-starobin.html", "item_type": "Article"}
