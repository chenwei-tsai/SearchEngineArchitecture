I thought I was going to be a psychiatrist.\u201d As a co-host of Power 105.1\u2019s morning show \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d and as host of the MTV2 weekly talk show \u201cUncommon Sense Live,\u201d Charlamagne does serve as a counselor of sorts. His specialty is setting his guests and listeners straight whether or not they asked for his input. Three and a half years ago, he called Kanye West a \u201cwalking contradiction\u201d to his face, and those like Jay Z and a pastor who told children there is no Santa Claus have received the tell-it-like-I-see-it treatment. Now Charlamagne, who is in his late 30s, has written a book, \u201cBlack Privilege: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Create It\u201d (Touchstone), that seeks not to tear down but to lift up. Organized into eight principles for success (Principle 5: \u201cPut the Weed in the Bag!\u201d) and sprinkled with pearls of wisdom the author calls \u201cGod Jewels\u201d (Example: \u201cAlways be wary when someone over 40 calls you \u2018son\u2019 unless it\u2019s your own father\u201d), the book reads like a street-smart self-help guide. \u201cContrary to popular belief, all I want to do is empower people,\u201d said Charlamagne, whose given name is Lenard Larry McKelvey. \u201cI grew up in a rural area. Books are what helped me transcend my circumstances.\u201d \u201cBlack Privilege\u201d derives its lessons from Charlamagne\u2019s life, which began in a trailer on a dirt road in Moncks Corner, S.C., and included stints in jail for drug possession and a failed career as a rapper. Even after he found his passion for radio, he was fired four times, for reasons that mostly involved speaking his mind, before ascending to his current position. If the book has a theme, it is honesty \u2014 or as Principle 6 states, \u201cLive Your Truth.\u201d Charlamagne opens with an unflattering story about getting beat up as a teenager, criticizes his own looks and \u201cegg-shaped dome,\u201d and admits to being overwhelmed when he first did radio in the city. \u201cIf you\u2019re not from New York, you never fully get adjusted,\u201d Charlamagne said. \u201cI\u2019m worried there will be a terrorist attack and I\u2019ll be trapped underground. I\u2019m paranoid like that.\u201d By confessing weaknesses and faults, he writes, no one can use them against you. And being himself and speaking his true views, he maintained, has kept him from blowing up his career like other media personalities. \u201cHonesty is a foundation, and it\u2019s usually a solid foundation,\u201d Charlamagne said. \u201cEven if I do get in trouble for what I said, it\u2019s something that I can stand on.\u201d Last fall, he was taken to task for a comment he made on Twitter, expressing his desire for \u201ca young black or Hispanic \u2018WOKE\u2019 woman\u201d to create a platform the way Tomi Lahren has for her conservative views. \u201cThey went crazy on me,\u201d he recalled. \u201c\u2018Charlamagne Tha God is in love with Tomi Lahren\u2019 and \u2018The black man\u2019s obsession with white women.\u2019 It was bad.\u201d But as Principle 4 states: \u201cThere are no losses, only lessons\u201d \u2014 in this case, that Twitter is a \u201cpoor man\u2019s chain letter,\u201d Charlamagne said, and not the medium to communicate an argument without it being misconstrued. With \u201cBlack Privilege,\u201d Charlamagne is making a bid to be an influential voice in the African-American community like Steve Harvey, whose best-selling books and multimedia career are a model for him. He wants to produce TV shows and films, and become more philanthropic. \u201cThis book is a bolt on my past life,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell those stories anymore. I\u2019m on to the next thing.\u201d Still, he said, he has no plans to stop doing radio or speaking his mind to celebrities who may be living in a bubble. \u201cKanye West sends me Yeezys,\u201d Charlamagne said, referring to the rapper\u2019s signature sneakers. \u201cI don\u2019t wear them because I\u2019m not into Yeezys. But that\u2019s not going to stop me from saying he\u2019s in a sunken place.\u201d", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00"}
