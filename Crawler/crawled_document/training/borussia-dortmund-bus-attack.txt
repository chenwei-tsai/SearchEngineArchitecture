The arrest of the suspect, identified only as Sergei W. in keeping with German privacy laws, represented the clearest explanation to date for the motive behind the attack, which was initially thought to be the work of Islamist extremists after three letters found at the site claimed responsibility. One player was wounded in the April 11 bombing as the team was heading to its stadium for a Champions League match against AS Monaco, forcing officials to reschedule the game for the following night. Monaco won that night, 3-2, and went on to oust the German team from the playoffs in a second leg, winning at home 3-1. The attack caused widespread fear about security for both players and spectators of the country\u2019s most popular sport, which draws tens of thousands of fans into stadiums across the country and around the world every weekend. Terrorism experts immediately questioned the authenticity of the letters, which were found on the night of the attack in the hedges by the roadside where the bombs had been planted, federal prosecutors said in a statement on Friday. Prosecutors said that an additional letter was later sent to German news organizations, claiming that the attack was carried out by the far right, proved to be unfounded. According to prosecutors, the suspect had checked into the hotel where the team was staying. On the day of the attack, he purchased 15,000 put options for shares in the team, which is publicly traded, that would have entitled him to sell them at a predetermined price. The financial maneuver could have resulted in a substantial profit for the suspect if the value of the shares had fallen in the interim, prosecutors said. \u201cA significant share price drop could have been expected if a player had been seriously injured or even killed as a result of the attack,\u201d they said.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T02:50:03-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/europe/borussia-dortmund-bus-attack.html", "item_type": "Article"}
