{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cStill Civic-Minded, but He\u2019ll Speak for $400,000\u201d (news article, April 27): The news that former President Barack Obama will accept a large fee to speak before a forum sponsored by an investment bank is disheartening. In this age of Trump, I would have hoped that no Democrat would accept an invitation to appear before an organization willing and able to pay $400,000 to hear a speech. Doing so only validates the idea that there is no meaningful difference between the parties. To the extent that this view may be accurate, it is something that Democrats need to change. JONATHAN J.
