Savchenko, a captured Ukrainian military pilot, until Tuesday morning. Ms. Savchenko is accused of directing artillery fire that killed two Russian journalists during a battle between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatist militias in eastern Ukraine in 2014. She has said she was captured by the separatists before the shelling occurred. The case has acquired symbolic weight in both Russia and Ukraine, and has highlighted the strained relations between Moscow and the West. Her lawyers said they had no doubt that their client would be convicted and sentenced to a lengthy prison term. European officials have repeatedly demanded that the Russian government release Ms. Savchenko. In a telephone conversation last week with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, President Obama urged her release, but Mr. Putin said he could not interfere with the court proceedings, according to his spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov.", "abstract": "Nadiya V. Savchenko is accused of directing artillery fire that killed two Russian journalists, in a case that has become symbolic in Russia and Ukraine."}
