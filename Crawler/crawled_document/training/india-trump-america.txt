But many are infuriated and unnerved by what they see as a wave of racist violence under President Trump, souring America\u2019s allure. The reaction is not just anger and anxiety. Now, young Indians who have aspired to study, live and work in the United States are looking elsewhere. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what might happen to us while walking on the street there,\u201d said Kanika Arora, a 20-year-old student in Mumbai who is reconsidering her plan to study in the United States. \u201cThey might just think that we\u2019re terrorists.\u201d Recent attacks on people of Indian descent in the United States are explosive news in India. A country once viewed as the Promised Land now seems for many to be dangerously inhospitable. Further alienating Indians, especially among its highly educated class, is the Trump administration\u2019s reassessment of H1-B visas given mostly for information technology jobs. More than 85,000 are granted a year, the majority to Indians. \u201cAmerica was the land of great opportunity,\u201d said Sanket Bafna, 21, as he emerged one afternoon last week from an exam at K.C. College, where he\u2019s studying financial management. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same land.\u201d This year, undergraduate applications from India fell at 26 percent of United States educational institutions, and 15 percent of graduate programs, according to a survey of 250 American universities by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. The number of applications for H1-B visas also fell to 199,000, a nearly 20 percent decline, according to data kept by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Like many others, Indians were offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to block the Mexico border with a wall and bar people from six predominantly Muslim countries. Some took solace that India was not targeted. But they soon saw that anti-immigrant rage in America did not discriminate. In February, two Indian immigrants were shot, one fatally, at a bar in Kansas by a gunman who witnesses said had shouted ethnic slurs and told them they did not belong in the United States. Since then, several more attacks on Indian immigrants have been closely covered by the Indian news media. While the authorities have not linked all to anti-immigrant bigotry, the belief that Indians are under attack in America seems cemented in the minds of many. About 3.2 million people of Indian descent live in the United States, slightly more than 1 percent of the population, a Pew Research Center report found. Most hold green cards and H1-B visas, and are far more affluent and educated than the average American. Indian-Americans play an outsize role in Silicon Valley, where some, including Google Inc.\u2019s chief executive, Sunder Pichai, have founded or run some of the most successful companies. But success stories like Mr. Pichai\u2019s no longer inspire the jealousy they once did in India. Ms. Arora, leaving H.R. College of Commerce and Economics, where she had finished an exam, said her parents had reservations about sending her brother to the United States, where he had been planning to enroll in college this year. Ms. Arora said she, like her brother, \u201cdid aspire to work and study in America, but I\u2019m reconsidering.\u201d The biggest reason, she said, was the violence directed against Indians. \u201cEvery day, there\u2019s a new headline about an Indian or Asian getting killed,\u201d she said. Now, she said, she and others in India were looking more favorably on Europe for study and work, despite the upheaval over Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union. \u201cComparatively, it\u2019s considered safer,\u201d she said. In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may benefit their home country by cutting off the brain drain, Ms. Arora and other Indians said. \u201cAll the intelligent people are coming back and can work here,\u201d she added. As students of Mumbai\u2019s colleges, after finishing their exams, reviewed dog-eared question papers with friends on the sidewalk, they returned again and again to astonishment that someone like Mr. Trump could be elected. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, how did you elect somebody like him,\u2019\u201d said Shantanu Sivan, 20, who studies mass media at Wilson College. \u201cI think I lost hope in the people of America.\u201d Ananya Gupta, 21, who studies financial management at K.C. College, laced his disappointment with contempt. \u201cThat just shows where they stand intellectually, electing a person of Trump\u2019s nature as a president,\u201d he said. Standing across the street from his college, among other students at a beverage stand, Mr. Gupta replied \u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d when asked if he had an opinion on America under Mr. Trump. \u201cOf course as a child, I used to dream about going to America, the land of opportunity. But today, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go there.\u201d Not everyone is so negative about America under Mr. Trump. Devanshu Jain, 21, said he still planned to study and work there. \u201cThere\u2019s racism in India, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to work for Goldman Sachs in New York City, right?\u201d But he said some friends were \u201cso shaken up about what\u2019s happening\u201d that they have transferred from American universities to Canadian institutions in recent months. At Mumbai\u2019s Todi Mills, an old mill area converted in recent years into restaurants, bars and office space for young entrepreneurs, Mr. Trump\u2019s America is also viewed with trepidation. \u201cPeople are really thinking America\u2019s going downhill,\u201d said Shikha Mittal, 33, founder of Be.artsy, a nine-person firm specializing in using art for marketing. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to take him seriously because the perception is so nonserious about him, that he\u2019s not fit for the role he\u2019s got,\u201d Ms. Mittal said. \u201cIt\u2019s affected how people think about America. What made people vote for him? What sort of people have voted for him?\u201d Around the corner, Abhishek Singh, 23, sat with a friend at a patio table of a pub, worrying about the effect on Mr. Trump on the world. \u201cThe U.S. has been such a good country with such good policies,\u201d said Mr. Singh, a brewer. \u201cAnd this guy comes to power, and you don\u2019t know what he might actually do.\u201d Mr. Singh, who dreams about owning a pub some day, said he was scared by Mr. Trump\u2019s recent bombings in Syria and Afghanistan. \u201cHe might start World War III,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cHe might kill us all.\u201d Still, some Indians seem willing to overlook what they find offensive about Mr. Trump if he is tough on Pakistan. India has fought three wars with Pakistan, and many Indians think it is behind terrorist attacks in the country. Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk on terrorism has given these Indians hope. \u201cOn one side, he\u2019s absolutely a mad guy,\u201d said Abhay Bhalerao, 50, the founder and managing director of a software company that provides price comparison data. \u201cBut on other side, he seems to understand that Pakistan is the bad guy.\u201d", "published_date": "2017-04-22T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World"}
