Met leaders have mulled a mandatory fee over the last year as they resorted to cost-cutting steps, including laying off staff, postponing a new wing and reducing the number of annual exhibitions to about 40, from nearly 60. Charging admission would generate significant new revenue, but the move could have unintended consequences for municipal financing of the museum, for the Met\u2019s reputation as a public institution, for tourism and even for Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign. Unlike several Manhattan museums that charge admission, the Met is owned by New York City, which gives the museum $26 million \u2014 the largest amount that the city provides to an arts institution. Still, the city\u2019s appropriation to the Met covers just about 8 percent of the museum\u2019s $332 million annual operating costs. The Met\u2019s current \u201csuggested\u201d adult admissions fee, $25, generated about $39 million in the fiscal year 2016, or 13 percent of the museum\u2019s overall revenue. A mandatory fee would be likely to generate tens of millions of dollars more a year, providing a much-needed and reliable shot in the arm. Should the Met stand to make these additional millions, the city might become more inclined to shift public money to other arts groups, a prospect that city officials are now considering as part of a new Cultural Plan, to be released soon. The Met board and the mayor would both have to agree on an admissions fee and navigate the symbolic shoals of making a taxpayer-supported institution no longer free to all. \u201cWe have spoken to the Metropolitan Museum about the possibility of changing its admission structure \u2014 not for New Yorkers, but for out-of-town visitors,\u201d said Tom Finkelpearl, the city\u2019s commissioner of cultural affairs. \u201cShould we receive a formal proposal, we will consider it.\u201d Eric Phillips, a spokesman for Mayor de Blasio did not respond to requests for comment. The discussions come at a precarious time for the Met. Leaders of the museum, the nation\u2019s largest, have made financial missteps that have led to a budget deficit that stands at about $15 million. The Met\u2019s director, Thomas P. Campbell, resigned under pressure in February, and the board of trustees \u2014 which includes mayoral and city appointees \u2014 has been criticized for poor oversight. Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and its acting chief executive officer, acknowledged this week that the museum is \u201clooking at everything to bridge our budget deficit, including the pricing structure we have with the city, which is something we have done throughout our history.\u201d He added that city officials \u201chave a right to a clear understanding of how we would be engaging the public, how we balance access with sustainability.\u201d The Met\u2019s discussions with the city \u2014 which people inside the museum and city government recently confirmed to The Times \u2014 have been confidential, since the issue is considered so sensitive. There is great importance attached to the idea of the city\u2019s pre-eminent museum remaining free to enter, even though the Met has for more than four decades had a suggested admission fee. The 1893 law providing state support to the museum mandated that its collections \u201cshall be kept open and accessible to the public free of all charge throughout the year.\u201d There are models for admissions fees at public museums: Entry to the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris, for example, is free to residents of the European Union younger than 26; others have to pay 15 euros, or about $16. Institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum charge $25 for adults, and the Whitney Museum of American Art $22. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to museums and cultural institutions charging out-of-city residents,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, the majority leader of the City Council and the chairman of its Cultural Affairs Committee, who said he was unaware of the Met talks. \u201cWhen I go to Paris and Madrid and the Pergamon in Berlin, I expect to pay. I\u2019m more than O.K. as an American tourist abroad paying because I also understand that what I\u2019m doing is helping to support these amazing institutions.\u201d Currently, 63 percent of the Met\u2019s seven million annual visitors come from outside New York State. Still to be determined is whether the new charges would apply only to nonresidents of New York City or to nonresidents of New York State. What about people who commute every day into the city for work and consider themselves New Yorkers? And how would residency be established at the front desk? These are two of the questions that Met leaders and city officials must reckon with before a final decision is made. Indeed, the political optics of instituting an admissions fee could impact Mayor de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign, especially if the city-owned museum is seen as gouging tourists or reversing a historic principle of making a cultural institution free to the public. \u201cThis risks being a classic case of \u2018penny wise and pound foolish,\u2019\u201d said Mark Green, the former New York City public advocate. \u201cRevenue is good, but so is our reputation of being a tourist-welcoming city.\u201d The talks between the Met and the city are taking place as the de Blasio administration prepares in the next couple of weeks to release a draft report of the new Cultural Plan, which would manage and organize the city\u2019s resources for arts groups. A 2016 law passed by the City Council requires the city\u2019s Department of Cultural Affairs to present the plan to the council by July 1. In developing the plan, called Create NYC, Cultural Affairs \u2014 together with the nonprofit Hester Street Collaborative as a consultant \u2014 has sought guidance on what residents want and need from arts organizations and has studied the plans of other cities like Boston and Chicago. This process has included a re-evaluation of the financing formula that for years has dictated how much each of the 33 organizations on city-owned land that make up the Cultural Institutions Group receive to help cover basic costs like security, maintenance and energy. The city also provides funding for building projects from a separate budget. Given Mayor de Blasio\u2019s focus on equal access, many arts groups are concerned that the new cultural plan will markedly redistribute the city\u2019s $181.2 million arts budget, directing somewhat less to large institutions like the Met and more to smaller institutions. When the mayor added $10 million to his cultural budget last year, larger organizations received a 6 percent increase, while smaller groups received a 12 percent increase. The public-private partnership between the city and the Cultural Institutions Group dates to 1869, when state legislation authorized the city to construct a building for the new American Museum of Natural History, providing use of the city-owned property to the private nonprofit group that had been created to acquire the collection and oversee exhibitions. A change in the Met\u2019s admissions policy could also have an impact on tourism, which both museum and city officials are taking into account. Christopher Heywood, a spokesman for NYC & Company, the city\u2019s tourism organization, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information on this at this point to make a relevant comment.\u201d Complicating matters, the Met was the subject of a legal challenge to its admissions policy, a case that was settled only last year. Two lawsuits asserted that the wording on the signs at the museum\u2019s admissions desks was deceptive and pressured visitors to pay $25 even though, under the museum\u2019s policy, they could pay whatever they wished. Under the legal settlement, which awaits final court approval, the Met agreed to tell visitors on its signage and websites that \u201cthe amount you pay is up to you\u201d and to describe the $25 full-admission charge as \u201csuggested\u201d instead of \u201crecommended.\u201d In addition to making cuts, the Met has been trying to build revenue \u2014 in part by improving its retail shops, which were formerly losing money. The prospect of charging admission could represent a significant infusion of income when the museum needs it most. \u201cWhatever we do is going to be collaborative and mutually supportive,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cAll we\u2019re doing is exploring.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T10:39:34-04:00", "section": "Arts", "abstract": "Despite its history as a public institution with free entry to all, the museum is considering a mandatory charge to help address budget deficits.", "item_type": "Article"}
