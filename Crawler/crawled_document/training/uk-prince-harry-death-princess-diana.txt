The candid statement by the prince, in a podcast released on Monday by The Daily Telegraph, is the latest indication of a shift within the British monarchy toward greater openness, led by a younger generation. The two princes, along with Prince William\u2019s wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, are leading a campaign called Heads Together to end stigma around mental illness. Prince Harry, 32, said that not dealing with the trauma had contributed to years of \u201ctotal chaos\u201d in his late 20s. \u201cI can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and sort of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle.\u201d The exchange, a rare glimpse into the private life of a member of the royal family, drew applause from advocates for people with mental illness. Others praised the prince for speaking out about grief. Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, at the age of 36; she and Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, had divorced the previous year. The reaction to the violent, unexpected death became a symbol of emotional and generational conflicts, and a turning point in the royal family\u2019s relationship with ordinary Britons. For several days, Queen Elizabeth II maintained her predecessors\u2019 traditional \u2014 critics would say stony \u2014 reserve. But as people worldwide mourned Diana, who had been distinguished by her charisma and poise, Buckingham Palace came under criticism for its silence, and the queen finally broke her silence by making a live broadcast to the nation acknowledging the \u201coverwhelming expression of sadness\u201d and praising her former daughter-in-law as \u201can exceptional and gifted human being.\u201d In the podcast, Prince Harry said he had tried to cope with the tragedy by not talking about it. \u201cMy way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?\u201d he said. He recalled thinking: \u201c \u2018It\u2019s only going to make you sad, it\u2019s not going to bring her back.\u2019 So from an emotional side, I was like, \u2018Right, don\u2019t ever let your emotions be part of anything.\u2019 \u201d Prince Harry, who spent 10 years in the British armed forces and served two tours in Afghanistan, said in the interview that his struggles had consumed much of his 20s. (He was 27 in 2012, when tabloids published images of him naked while partying in Las Vegas, which prompted him to apologize for having \u201clet my family down.\u201d) The prince also praised the virtues of getting professional help. \u201cSome of the best people or easiest people to speak to is a shrink or whoever \u2014 the Americans call them shrinks \u2014 someone you have never met before,\u201d he said. \u201cYou sit down on the sofa and say: \u2018Listen, I don\u2019t actually need your advice. Can you just listen?\u2019 And you just let it all rip.\u201d Asked about counseling, he said he had received it \u201cmore than a couple of times, but it\u2019s great.\u201d He credited his brother with telling him: \u201c\u2018Look, you really need to deal with this. It is not normal to think that nothing has affected you.\u2019\u201d Prince Harry also said that boxing had helped. \u201cThat really saved me because I was on the verge of punching someone, so being able to punch someone who had pads was certainly easier,\u201d he said. He added that staying quiet about emotional suffering in distress was \u201conly ever going to make it worse,\u201d and he urged people in such situations to seek help. \u201cYou will be surprised, firstly, how much support you get,\u201d he said. Prince Harry spoke to Bryony Gordon, a British journalist who has written about her own struggles with depression and with obsessive compulsive disorder. The prince was the first guest on the podcast \u201cMad World,\u201d in which Ms. Gordon interviews a series of people about their mental health. He had said that he regretted not discussing his mother\u2019s death earlier in an interview last year. This year, Prince Harry and Prince William announced that they had commissioned a statue at Kensington Palace of their mother to commemorate the 20th anniversary of her death. As well as the Heads Together campaign, Prince Harry has also co-founded a charity to support children in Lesotho, where he spent time before joining the military, and created the Invictus Games, a sporting event for wounded or sick service members."}
