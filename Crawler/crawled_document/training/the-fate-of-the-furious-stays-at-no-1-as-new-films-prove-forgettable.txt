The top three movies at the North American box office were all holdovers. \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d (Universal) collected about $38.7 million, for a two-week worldwide total of $908.4 million. \u201cThe Boss Baby\u201d (20th Century Fox) was second, taking in about $12.8 million. Disney\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d chugged along in third place, generating roughly $10 million in ticket sales. All of those movies share a common DNA. They are glossy, big-budget extravaganzas stuffed with elements to hook global audiences: extreme stunts, Alec Baldwin as a talking infant, boundary-pushing visual effects, song and dance. On the other hand, the five new films vying for attention seemed shipped in from another era. They included a modestly budgeted, star-driven thriller; a nature documentary; and a period drama with romantic overtones. But consumers continued to send a message with their feet: These are the kinds of movies we now watch at home, either on streaming services like Netflix, HBO Go and Amazon Prime or through the vast on-demand platforms operated by cable and satellite providers. Warner Bros., for instance, put forward the suspense film \u201cUnforgettable\u201d in 2,417 domestic theaters over the weekend, backing its release with tens of millions of dollars worth of billboards, television ads and posters at shopping malls \u2014 tried and true marketing tools that used to be able to compel crowds into theaters. But \u201cUnforgettable,\u201d which cost $12 million to produce, only managed about $4.8 million in ticket sales. (Memo to studios: Perhaps retire the title \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d There have now been three films and a television series with that name over the last two decades. Can you identify one?) Warner has suffered a string of these middle-market misfires, including \u201cCHIPS,\u201d \u201cGoing in Style,\u201d \u201cFist Fight,\u201d \u201cLive by Night,\u201d \u201cWar Dogs\u201d and \u201cThe Nice Guys.\u201d Almost none were financial wipeouts. But they nonetheless have drained the studio of resources, particularly in marketing. The other weekend arrivals included \u201cThe Promise\u201d (Open Road), a period drama that cost nearly $100 million to make; it collected a catastrophic $4.1 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. The nature documentary \u201cBorn in China\u201d (Disney) had about $5.1 million in ticket sales. A low-budget horror film, \u201cPhoenix Forgotten\u201d (Cinelou), took in roughly $2 million, while the art-house action picture \u201cFree Fire\u201d (A24) played to mostly empty theaters, generating about $1 million."}
