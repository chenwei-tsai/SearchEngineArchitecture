It was literary flotsam, a poem I hadn\u2019t heard of and couldn\u2019t place in time or tradition. Here were the names of Homer \u2014 Hector, Helen, Philoctete, Achille \u2014 but also Voodoo deities and lines from \u201cBuffalo Soldier,\u201d ghosts of Troy but also camera-wielding tourists and fishermen revving chain saws as they prepared to fell the ancient trees (those last silent \u201cgods\u201d of a pre-Columbian past) on a forested volcanic slope. The stanzas moved to Dante\u2019s terza rima, but the poem began in patois: \u201cThis is how, one sunrise, we cut down them canoes.\u201d The book followed me everywhere. A chronicle of modern St. Lucia, it was also an epic of the New World, weaving from its characters\u2019 encounters with history a deeper, vaster story on a sunken loom. On walks down the Lenape Trail near my childhood home in New Jersey, I listened for the lost Indian languages Walcott heard in the woodcutters\u2019 pyre: \u201ca resinous bonfire that turned the leaves brown/ with curling tongues, then ash, and their language was lost.\u201d When the fisherman Hector battled a hurricane in his canoe, I read along in the rain under a bus shelter in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, surrounded by Caribbean storefronts \u2014 a diaspora shipwrecked in the same storms of history that Walcott\u2019s epic traced. A year later, my reading of \u201cOmeros\u201d took me to Benin, Togo and Senegal, where I researched the remembrance of slavery in the old ports of the Atlantic trade. In Dakar, standing on a cliffside near the corniche, I watched the ocean traversed by my ancestors, Walcott\u2019s verse a blessing on their trials: \u201cBut they crossed, they survived./ There is the epical splendor. \u2026 the grace born from subtraction as the hold\u2019s iron door/ rolled over their eyes.\u201d I walked so close to the edge that a student on his lunch break tapped my shoulder and said, \u201cYou better not fall in.\u201d But I already had, not only into Atlantic history but also into Caribbean literature, and poetry from the N\u00e9gritude movement to W. H. Auden and T. S. Eliot. Because of Walcott I read Jean Rhys\u2019s \u201cWide Sargasso Sea\u201d and Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire\u2019s \u201cNotebook of a Return to the Native Land,\u201d Alejo Carpentier\u2019s \u201cThe Kingdom of This World\u201d and Patrick Chamoiseau\u2019s \u201cTexaco.\u201d I reread \u201cThe Tempest\u201d and lyrics from two Bobs (Marley and Lowell), then landed back in the novels, and later the classroom, of Jamaica Kincaid. The last place \u201cOmeros\u201d took me was to St. Lucia, where just over a year before Walcott died I attended the Nobel Laureate Week celebrations for his 86th birthday. During a catamaran ride around the island, while dozens of guests danced and drank on deck, the poet sat anchored in his wheelchair like Odysseus tied to the mast. His eyes read the passing landscape like a poem in progress: checking the scansion of the shoreline, firming the mountains\u2019 metaphors, making sure there was nothing he had missed. If you want to explore Walcott\u2019s work, these five poems are a good place to begin. \u2018MIDSUMMER I\u2019 (\u2018MIDSUMMER,\u2019 1984) Begin with this window-seat epiphany from the poet in flight, sky liner notes rivaled only by James Merrill\u2019s \u201cA Downward Look\u201d and Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s \u201cNight City.\u201d Walcott approaches Trinidad in a plane recast as a pond\u2019s gliding insect: \u201cThe jet like a silverfish bores through volumes of cloud.\u201d From this altitude, all his major themes appear in dioramic miniature: the Odyssean homecoming, this contiguity between language and landscape (\u201csharp exclamations of whitewashed minarets\u201d), and the Caribbean\u2019s existence beyond official histories. Landing is loveliest \u2014 each successive layer of the rematerializing world yields a \u201cshelving sense of home.\u201d \u2018THE SEA IS HISTORY\u2019 (\u2018THE STAR-APPLE KINGDOM, 1979) The orator Demosthenes liked to practice speaking on the seashore, voice raised in challenge to the roaring surf. The ocean is an ancient argument, and here Walcott makes it answer a contemptuous dismissal of the islands\u2019 history. \u201cWhere are your battles, your monuments, martyrs?\u201d asks the voice of a metropolitan skeptic \u2014 and the poet\u2019s strident answer is \u201cthe sea.\u201d Underwater, Caribbean pasts fuse with biblical scenes and the rhythms of marine life, evoking both classical underworlds and the sunken island afterlife of Haitian Voodoo. Bones from the drowned of the Middle Passage are reborn as a living Book of Exodus: \u201cmosaics/ mantled by the benediction of the shark\u2019s shadow.\u201d \u2018LOVE AFTER LOVE\u2019 (\u2018SEA GRAPES,\u2019 1976) If Walcott had a pop song, \u201cLove After Love\u201d would be it. Uncharacteristically free of proper nouns (no Latinate tropical flowers or seaside villages with soft Creole names), it is a simple, tender promise of healing after heartbreak: A celebration of return from love\u2019s tempestuous self-exile, the poem\u2019s interior landfall is ultimately inseparable from Walcott\u2019s grander voyages. Concentrically nested in all his circumnavigations of history are the wanderings and homecomings of the individual heart. \u2018THE ANTILLES: FRAGMENTS OF EPIC MEMORY\u2019 (1992) Evoking a Trinidadian performance of the Hindu epic \u201cThe Ramayana,\u201d Walcott begins his 1992 Nobel Lecture by celebrating the hybrid beauty of Caribbean civilization. The speech is not only a paean to a region but a defense of the islands often dismissed (even by V. S. Naipaul, Walcott\u2019s nemesis) as shapeless derivations of those African, Asian and European \u201coriginals\u201d from which its people retain only shards. But it is in this \u201cgathering of broken pieces\u201d that Walcott finds the archipelago\u2019s poetry: \u201cBreak a vase, and the love that reassembles the fragments is stronger than that love which took its symmetry for granted when it was whole.\u201d \u2018ANOTHER LIFE\u2019 (1973) Rare is the artist lucky enough to grow up with his country. \u201cFor no one had yet written of this landscape/ that it was possible,\u201d says Walcott in this luminous autobiography, a verse chronicle of his artistic apprenticeship during the twilight of colonialism and the early years of St. Lucia\u2019s independence. The book\u2019s highlight is Walcott\u2019s young friendship with the painter Dunstan St. Omer (Gregorias in the poem), companion and competitor in his quest to immortalize the island. Among the most moving tributes to home in poetry, \u201cAnother Life\u201d makes it clear why St. Lucia gave Derek Walcott a state funeral \u2014 his coffin swathed in the national flag designed by St. Omer.", "abstract": "How one reader came under the spell of Walcott\u2019s poetry.
