{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. Kanwal Khurana loved living in Cleveland. He and his wife had moved from the suburbs to an apartment in the city in December. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see the whole downtown.\u201d But less than two months later, Mr. Khurana and his wife had just parked their car across the street from the building when they heard someone say, \u201cgo back to your own country.\u201d The next morning, they discovered that someone had slashed all four of their tires. Mr. Khurana, 63, is retired from his job writing contracts for Cuyahoga County, and his wife is a homemaker. They help their son pay his tuition at Kent State. They have car insurance, but still had to come up with a $500 co-payment to have their car towed and repaired, plus the fee to rent a car in the meantime. The Khuranas reached out to city and state officials for help paying their bills. They discovered, as many victims of hate and harassment do, that getting financial assistance isn\u2019t always easy. Victims of hate crimes can sue perpetrators under state and federal hate crime or other civil rights laws for compensatory damages and, in some cases, punitive damages as well. But first they need lawyers. The Lawyers\u2019 Committee on Civil and Human Rights recently began operating a hotline at 844-9-NO-HATE (844-966-4283), through which volunteers can help callers find legal representation. But beyond that, \u201cthere is no real comprehensive network around the country\u201d to connect victims of hate crimes or harassment with lawyers, said Betsy Shuman-Moore, the director of the Hate Crime Project at the Chicago Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights. In the Chicago area, she added, legal resources for hate crime victims have actually decreased in recent years. When the perpetrator remains unidentified, as in the Khuranas\u2019 case, a lawsuit is usually not an option. Some states, however, have funds set aside to help crime victims pay their expenses. Mr. Khurana wrote to the mayor of Cleveland, whose staff suggested he contact the Ohio attorney general\u2019s office. The office maintains a victims\u2019 compensation fund, but Mr. Khurana was told he was not eligible for compensation because he had not been physically injured. The office sent him a booklet titled \u201cPicking Up the Pieces\u201d with information about crime victims\u2019 rights. Sometimes, friends or family \u2014 or strangers \u2014 step in to help hate crime victims. After Cristina Alfonso-Zea was attacked last year in the parking lot outside her home in Las Vegas by assailants who hit her in the head, stole her wallet and phone and wrote slurs on her car, her friend set up a GoFundMe campaign to help her. Ms. Alfonso-Zea, a veteran, already had post-traumatic stress disorder, which was exacerbated by the attack. The money from the campaign helped her fix her car and move away from the area where she was attacked. The campaign also helped her psychologically, she said: \u201cIt made me realize that there\u2019s really good people out there that really care about you, even if they don\u2019t know you.\u201d She wishes hate crime victims got more information on compensation funds and other resources. \u201cIn Las Vegas, they teach us about flash flooding, they teach us abandonment of a rabbit is a felony,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at the same time they don\u2019t really teach us about having funds like that or having a safe place that you can go to.\u201d Mrs. Khurana ultimately sold some of her jewelry to pay for their car expenses. The Khuranas don\u2019t plan to move, but they are more careful when they go out in their neighborhood now, and they park their car in a different spot that costs $5 a day. Mr. Khurana is grateful he and his wife weren\u2019t hurt \u2014 he thinks of the shooting of two Indian immigrants, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, in Kansas in February. \u201cThat night anything could have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still feel lucky.\u201d If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to This Week in Hate and other partners in the Documenting Hate project.
