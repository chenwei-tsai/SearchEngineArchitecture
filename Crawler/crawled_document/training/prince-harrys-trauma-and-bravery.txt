{"section": "Opinion", "text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cPrince Harry Says He Sought Counseling to Address Trauma From Mother\u2019s Death\u201d (news article, April 18): It was heartbreaking that shame and stigma kept Prince Harry quiet for far too long after the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car crash in 1997. Breaking his silence helps both him and thousands of other children who should be spared years of pain. Evidence-based, trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy used with children and their caregivers tackles the onslaught of thoughts, feelings and behaviors after a tragic death that can derail a young person. As Prince Harry bravely reveals, left untreated, the resulting avoidance, overwhelming emotion and unsuccessful coping can interfere with life. Treated sooner after a life-altering event, children can learn to openly address what felt unspeakable and forge a productive path. ROBIN F.
