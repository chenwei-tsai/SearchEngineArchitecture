Balanchine (1904-83) was New York City Ballet\u2019s founding ballet master, in 1948; when it dances his ballets, the most irresistible response is to talk about the dancers. It\u2019s also the most superficial, but let\u2019s attend to this surface level first. On Tuesday night, the company opened its six-week spring season at Lincoln Center with a program of three Balanchine ballets: Many dancers at all levels were like greyhounds unleashed. Nothing was more sensational than Tiler Peck\u2019s performance in the opener, \u201cAllegro Brillante\u201d (1956). This ballet has been a first-rate vehicle for this intensely musical virtuoso for some years, but on Tuesday she broke through to a new fire-and-wind level of fervor; her brilliance was fueled by both abandon and vehemence. The performances of Sara Mearns (Sanguinic) and Teresa Reichlen (Choleric) in \u201cThe Four Temperaments\u201d (1946) were quite as vivid. Ms. Mearns, pouncing breezily through the knottily rapid-fire steps, devouring space elsewhere with Amazonian boldness. Ms. Reichlen, coolly explosive, was rage and fate combined. These women were already exceptional: What ever has got into them now? In the second movement of \u201cSymphony in C\u201d \u2014 traditionally the most prestigious of all Balanchinian roles \u2014 Maria Kowroski was regal, poignant, elegiac. Tall, long-limbed and quietly commanding, she\u2019s the company\u2019s senior ballerina. The third movement was led by the bright newcomer Alston Macgill, acquitting herself with \u00e9lan (apart from a muddled final pirouette). Beside her was Harrison Ball, a soloist replacing Anthony Huxley at short notice, elegant and notably buoyant. Even after all these and the redoubtable but relentlessly pert Ashley Bouder (first movement), Brittany Pollack in the fourth movement set sparkling standards of top-speed precision. It\u2019s always tempting to keep the talk on dancers; their performances change from one day to the next, and seasons contain alternative casts. But deeper than dancers are the ballets themselves. Most Balanchine ballets are like a demonstration of Plato\u2019s theory of forms: They draw us into pure essence in a way that\u2019s phenomenal by the standards of any art. And the skill of their construction is such that you keep finding new facets in them. I began watching \u201cThe Four Temperaments\u201d 40 years ago, but only now am I struck by how the image of physical slumping \u2014 the torso falling forward heavily, the knees buckling, the arms hanging loose \u2014 occurs at least once for the lead dancer of each temperament (Melancholic, Sanguinic, Phlegmatic, Choleric). It\u2019s an image of dejection, torpor; it seems anti-ballet, and especially alien to the outgoing luster of Balanchine ballet. Yet it occurs in a few other Balanchine works, notably the early, seminal \u201cApollo\u201d (1928); I would guess that for this choreographer it\u2019s a portrait of the artist\u2019s exhaustion. And it\u2019s always temporary. Each of the lead dancers of \u201cThe Four Temperaments\u201d has a collapse of this kind \u2014 artists drained of inspiration \u2014 which then adds drama to their recovery. Each in a singular way shows the rebirth of inspiration. No such slumps occur in \u201cAllegro Brillante\u201d or \u201cSymphony in C.\u201d Balanchine called \u201cSymphony in C\u201d \u201ceverything I know about classical ballet in 13 minutes.\u201d You could pack a book with a close analysis of its expertise about the management of centrifugal stage space, gender, exuberant energy, numbers (just 10 dancers, but how many combinations?) and inflamed classicism. Yet \u201cSymphony in C\u201d \u2014 grander, more formally hierarchical, in four marvelously contrasting movements \u2014 shows how much else about classical ballet Balanchine already understood. Central to the construction of every Balanchine ballet is its intimate dialogue between dance and music, sometimes like question and answer, sometimes like spirit and flesh, sometimes like a pianist\u2019s right and left hands. This isn\u2019t the only way in which Balanchine makes ballet a revelation of pure form \u2014 these ballets have no scenery, and their costumes (even the shining white tutus of \u201cSymphony in C\u201d) are subordinate to their physicality \u2014 but it\u2019s the foundation of the Balanchine experience. \u201cTemperaments\u201d is to a score Balanchine commissioned from Paul Hindemith; \u201cSymphony in C\u201d is to a score by the young Bizet that was rediscovered only 12 years before Balanchine choreographed to it; \u201cAllegro Brillante\u201d is to one movement of an otherwise unfinished piano concerto by Tchaikovsky. I have heard musicians argue about just how good each of these scores really is (the Tchaikovsky is the thinnest), but the choreography Balanchine gives them makes the best case for their excellence. To mix metaphors, he leads you deep into their workings while putting wind in their sails. Andrew Litton, Tuesday\u2019s conductor and the company\u2019s music director, isn\u2019t invariably a natural accompanist. When I think of his most celebrated predecessor, Robert Irving, I see Irving\u2019s face, so often upturned to the dancers. But Mr. Litton keeps raising the City Ballet\u2019s orchestral playing. Dance and music meet as shining equals.", "material_type_facet": "Review", "item_type": "Article"}
