We were eating a buffet dinner and watching a talent show that combined sideshow stunts by performers \u2014 walking on nails and blowing flames into the sky \u2014 with gymnastics and G-rated jokes by guests, who included children and a few brave parents. When the crowd applauded, my 18-month-old daughter, Roxie, clapped excitedly with them. In the show\u2019s final act, an otherwise dignified Canadian father with Justin Trudeau-like good looks thrust his pelvis across the makeshift stage as if possessed by the spirit of Elvis Presley. I had somehow stepped into a scene from \u201cDirty Dancing,\u201d transported to a Catskills resort, circa 1963. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time, during our five-day stay, that I\u2019d feel this sense of generational disorientation \u2014 of being not so much in another country as in another era. Though my husband, Tim, Roxie and I had already been on the island for two days, we had not yet left the walled confines of our resort. Not only that: We had no plans to leave. Not even once. It wasn\u2019t that we weren\u2019t interested in seeing the island, birthplace of Rastafarianism, home of reggae and land of rum cake and jerk chicken. But as the parents of an increasingly energetic (and exhausting) toddler, our primary motivation for this trip \u2014 I\u2019m embarrassed to admit \u2014 was not culture or music or even the lush expanse of the Blue Mountains. It was babysitting. Affordable, reliable child care and the possibility, at least, of a vacation that actually felt like a vacation. To that end, we had maxed out our modest travel budget on airfare ($430 per flight) and four all-inclusive nights ($340 per night) before we even arrived. If the trip went as planned, we wouldn\u2019t spend another dollar \u2014 beyond tips, of course \u2014 after takeoff from New York\u2019s Kennedy International Airport. The obvious question, and the one that invariably nagged at me when I considered an all-inclusive: Why bother traveling to another country if you\u2019re going to spend the entire time at your hotel? It was a question I didn\u2019t have an answer to. And yet since I became pregnant, I had been hearing about Franklyn D. Resort & Spa, a modest, charmingly dated property an hour\u2019s drive from Montego Bay, a cruise ship port and the country\u2019s fourth largest city. I had noticed that it was mentioned in Facebook moms\u2019 groups and family travel forums, where I did a fair amount of anxious late-night lurking. F.D.R., as it\u2019s known among its many fans, had devotees \u2014 families who returned year after year. And I wanted to know why. Then we met Lisa Dixon, our \u201cvacation nanny.\u201d And I had my answer. I had known, of course, that child care was part of the F.D.R. package. But I didn\u2019t understand how it would work. Would I just leave my child with a stranger and somehow relax? I couldn\u2019t imagine it. A year and a half into parenthood, Tim and I had hired a babysitter only once. A nanny \u2014 a word I associate with British period dramas \u2014 seemed impossibly luxurious, as out of reach for two working writers as a personal chef or a private plane. But at F.D.R., Ms. Dixon\u2019s time and expertise was included in the price of our stay. Having descended from a matrilineal line of women who were paid to care for other people\u2019s children, I felt deeply conflicted about the \u201cvacation nanny\u201d concept before we arrived. I worried that it undervalued the work of women like my mother and grandmother. It seemed potentially exploitative. But the balance between cost and convenience is something with which every parent on a budget must grapple. Most of us make choices, at least occasionally, that we aren\u2019t entirely comfortable with \u2014 that raise questions we don\u2019t have easy answers to. I expected to feel uncomfortable in the hermetically sealed bubble of the resort, but the disorientation came as soon as we were on the airport shuttle bus. I felt uneasy at taking a vacation in another country with no intention of engaging with the people or culture, history or environment \u2014 or even just day-to-day life \u2014 of that place. There I was, watching Jamaica from a shuttle window. The driver, doing his best to engage his passengers\u2019 interest in the country they were visiting, performed a perfunctory call and response, quizzing us on the colors of the national flag: \u201cgold for the sunshine\u201d; \u201cgreen for vegetation, including the ganja\u201d; and \u201cblack.\u201d \u201cWhat is black for? Black is for the people,\u201d he said proudly. His audience of sun-seeking Canadian and American tourists seemed disinterested. After delivering passengers to three other resorts, we arrived at F.D.R., named for its owner, Franklyn, not the president. The place was compact and cheerfully bright. Unlike the towering white behemoths we\u2019d passed, it was just three stories tall, with 78 rooms, cobalt blue shutters and turquoise and lemon yellow piers jutting into the ocean. Narrow walkways wound through gardens planted in Christmas palms, lantana and hibiscus. The beach was piled with kayaks and paddleboards. The staff seemed to outnumber the guests. Our very first night, tempted by the prospect of a dinner date, I broke my own rule and spent $18 to hire Ms. Dixon to return for a two-hour babysitting stint outside her normal 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. shift. Ms. Dixon had short cropped hair, an unaffected smile and a 14-year-old daughter of her own. She had worked at F.D.R. for 16 years. She was about my age, and it was clear she took her job seriously. The $9-an-hour splurge was worth it, not to be stuck in the room \u2014 a pleasant, but spare two-room suite with floral bed spreads and tropical prints on the walls \u2014 after Roxie\u2019s usual 7 p.m. bedtime. Tim and I sat at a patio table above the beach, ate escovitch fish and eavesdropped on the neighboring table\u2019s political conversation about the recent United States presidential election before joining in ourselves. The two families, from Montreal and the Washington, D.C., area, had both been coming to the resort for years and had become friends. The Canadian family had three children, while the other had four adopted special-needs children (F.D.R. gives a 50 percent discount for such families). Both families loved the place and knew it inside and out. I could see immediately how, for families with multiple children, the resort would have particular appeal. The older kids were free to take turns whooshing down Big Blue \u2014 the resort\u2019s looping 100-foot water slide \u2014 snorkel at the small, sheltered beach or play video games in the teen club house, while the younger children were looked after by their nannies, who hover over them in lavender uniforms. (Though the resort declined to specify the hourly rate it pays nannies, an additional daytime nanny costs just $25 per day, which comes to a troubling $3 an hour in a country where a 10-pack of diapers costs $12.) Having worked with hundreds of children over the years, Ms. Dixon was almost certainly a more competent caregiver than I, a first-time parent, not yet two years in. Still, I had to force myself to step back, let Ms. Dixon do her job and not feel guilty about sitting at the open-air bar, sipping a rum and pineapple, watching Roxie on a beach cluttered with primary-colored play structures, content among the other children and their respective nannies. During our first two days on the island, the weather was moody. But having narrowly escaped a New York nor\u2019easter, we were unbothered by the choppy surf and darkened skies that kept us from the ocean. Tim and I, slowly getting used to being freed from child care, did childish things. He joined a ragtag collection of guests and played beach volleyball for the first time in his life, bloodying his knees diving for the ball. I rediscovered my love of water slides, racing up the wooden stairs to Big Blue again and again. When the sun finally came out and the wind relented, we outfitted Roxie in the smallest life vest we could find and climbed aboard F.D.R.\u2019s glass-bottomed boat \u2014 a shabby vessel with a picture frame bottom. After days of stormy weather, the water was cloudy, but Roxie was nonetheless enamored by her undersea view of the sandy bottom, occasional head of coral and hungry schools of shimmering fish, which jumped and churned for dinner rolls tossed overboard. Our tall, sinewy captain called himself Jack Sparrow and, in a running narration that veered into magical realism, referred to the fish as his \u201cbabies\u201d and melded characters from the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d with local legends about sunken ships and crashed airplanes. This was a man who enjoyed his job. Before returning to F.D.R., Captain Jack did a Hollywood tour bus-style drive-by of Unity House, an 18th-century stone structure that resembles a Georgian mansion, but is actually a former banana warehouse where the cast of Monty Python stayed in 1982, while developing \u201cThe Life of Brian.\u201d That night, our last at F.D.R., was Friday and dinner came with a show. Footsie, \u201cthe one-man band,\u201d played techno remixes of wedding party classics like \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d on a synthesizer as blue, green and red lights pulsed overhead. The elaborately costumed \u201cBridgette\u201d exhorted the audience for volunteers. The performer wore a bustle and heavy makeup that may have blended into a crowd raucously celebrating Caribbean Carnival festivities but felt cringingly out of context in front of our small, seated audience of clapping foreigners. Despite lifelong stage fright, I bowed to pressure when I was summoned to the center of the room. With dinner guests looking on, I followed Bridgette\u2019s instructions, popping my hips forward and back on her one-two-one-two command. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted Tim recording the mortifying moment on his cellphone \u2014 in case, presumably, he ever needed to blackmail me. My performance was clumsy and embarrassing, but also strangely exhilarating. It made me realize how long it had been since I was forced outside my comfort zone and how the resort bubble itself offered something valuable \u2014 it offered focused, undistracted time. Time alone, time together as a couple, and time as a family.
