That\u2019s a long trek, and seeing your byline on a New York Times crossword is a thrill. So I\u2019m happy for anyone who can do that. Now add to that the fact that the constructor is a young woman whose debut pays loving tribute to the first lady of song, ELLA Fitzgerald (also known as LADY ELLA), and you can imagine how happy that makes me. The fact that one of the constructor Olivia Mitra Framke\u2019s favorite musicians is someone who died 20 years ago gives me hope for our future. But wait, as a wise man once said, there\u2019s more. Ms. Framke\u2019s muse is Liz Gorski and her mentor is Nancy Salomon. That\u2019s a lot to live up to, and while some of the fill could be more exciting, the theme is beautifully placed and I think today\u2019s debut is stellar. The singer ELLA Fitzgerald was born 100 years ago on April 25, 1917, as the title of today\u2019s puzzle indicates. Two of the songs Ms. Fitzgerald made famous \u2014 \u201cA TISKET, A TASKET\u201d and \u201cHOW HIGH THE MOON\u201d \u2014 as well as her notable quote, \u201cI SING LIKE I FEEL\u201d and her frequent collaborator, LOUIS ARMSTRONG, make up the bones of the theme, but it\u2019s the center of Ms. Framke\u2019s grid that warmed my heart. LADY ELLA (split between 68- and 70 Across) sits on her throne right in the middle, and there is a notepad in the puzzle: \u201cWhen this puzzle is done, draw a line connecting the 11 circled letters, starting and ending in square #28, so as to spell a phrase related to the puzzle\u2019s theme.\u201d Not only does it spell out \u201cQUEEN OF JAZZ,\u201d but the line traced draws a picture of a crown. Like I said, stellar. \u25a0 89A: Rapa NUI is also known as Easter Island and the monoliths are the moai, or stone statues made from hardened volcanic ash. \u25a0 103A: CEELO Green was a vocal coach on \u201cThe Voice\u201d and is probably best known for his solo single called ... well, let\u2019s just say that the radio edit of the song is called \u201cForget You.\u201d \u25a0 125A: Your \u201cState representatives?\u201d can be people, but on an American flag, the states are represented as STARS. \u25a0 87D: \u201cOne in line?\u201d refers to a family line, not the kind one stands on. The answer is HEIR. Welcome, Ms. Framke.
