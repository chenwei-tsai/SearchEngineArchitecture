Kelly said of such children in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d In a separate interview, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions affirmed that the federal government did not \u201chave the ability to round up everybody.\u201d \u201cThese people are caught between the law,\u201d Mr. Kelly said on CNN, adding that \u201cthe president obviously is sympathetic.\u201c \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cI just wish these kind of issues were dealt with legally by the United States Congress.\u201d Mr. Sessions made a similar observation in the ABC interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the president has sympathy for young people who were brought here at early ages,\u201d he said. The administrations\u2019s \u201cfirst and strongest priority,\u201d Mr. Sessions added, was the \u201ccriminal element.\u201d Mr. Trump said in February that he would approach Mr. Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program \u201cwith heart,\u201d calling the so-called dreamers it affects \u201cabsolutely incredible kids.\u201d \u201cI have to deal with a lot of politicians, don\u2019t forget, and I have to convince them that what I\u2019m saying is \u2014 is right,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cThe existing law is very rough. It\u2019s very, very rough.\u201d On Friday, Mr. Trump told The Associated Press that undocumented immigrants brought here as children can \u201crest easy,\u201d and that his agenda was \u201cnot after the dreamers; we are after the criminals.\u201d Mr. Trump had a more nationalist posture during the campaign. \u201cI want dreamers to come from this country,\u201d he said in February 2016. \u201cWe\u2019re always talking about dreamers for other people. I want the children that are growing up in the United States to be dreamers also.\u201d Mr. Sessions was resolute on Sunday in arguing that the United States needed a more exacting immigration policy. \u201cMany of these are involved in criminal enterprises, hauling drugs and that kind of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to end that. And then we\u2019ve got to wrestle with what to do about people who have been here a long time.\u201d The Trump administration has continued to issue work permits to dreamers, but it also has moved to hasten the hiring of border agents. And the Justice Department recently sent letters to officials in jurisdictions known as \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d threatening them with the loss of federal aid if they failed to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. In a lawsuit filed last week, immigrant advocates accused the federal government of deporting for the first time an undocumented immigrant who had been allowed to stay in the country under the DACA program. Customs and Border Protection arrested the 23-year-old immigrant in California in February. On Sunday, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Sessions also addressed the accompanying problem of financing a wall on the Mexican border that Mr. Trump has vowed to build. The current congressional funding bill expires on Friday, and Mr. Trump has made the wall a fulcrum of his new budget proposals. On Sunday, Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, and Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s chief of staff, said they were confident that the Republican-controlled Congress would approve the president\u2019s plan. \u201cNo one foresees or wants a shutdown next week,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d When pressed on whether Mr. Trump would accept a budget that did not include money for the border wall, Mr. Mulvaney said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Mr. Priebus, appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be enough for us to move forward through the end of September for us to get going on the wall.\u201d When asked whether he believed that the federal government would remain open past this week, Mr. Priebus said, \u201cI believe it will.\u201d Later on Sunday, after those interviews, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.\u201d In another message posted a few minutes later, he wrote, \u201cEventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.\u201d Republicans from areas where the wall would be built appear hesitant about Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to pay for it. A survey last week by The Wall Street Journal found that the $1.4 billion price tag for the first portion of the wall is not supported by any member of Congress who represents territory along the southwest border. There were recriminations on Sunday from allies of Mr. Trump. When some congressional Republicans balked at supporting health care legislation the president supported, he deployed Mr. Mulvaney to threaten several of them with primary opponents. Republican Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina, confirmed as much while appearing on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI think that those kinds of threats are counterproductive,\u201d Mr. Sanford said. \u201cIt all, I guess, fits in love, war and politics. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly productive to his own legislative agenda, and we\u2019ll see what comes.\u201d"}
