{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "Maria Sharapova won her first tennis match after returning from 15-month doping ban on Wednesday, beating Roberta Vinci, 7-5, 6-3, at the Porsche Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany. Sharapova was given a lukewarm welcome by 4,500 spectators with polite applause and some whistling when she entered the sold-out arena. It was Sharapova\u2019s first match since losing to Serena Williams in the quarterfinals of the 2016 Australian Open, and her first match on clay in nearly two years. Last year, Sharapova tested positive for the banned substance meldonium. She had her initial two-year suspension reduced to 15 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled that she bore \u201cless than significant fault\u201d in the case and that she could not \u201cbe considered to be an intentional doper.\u201d Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion, had been taking meldonium for many years, but overlooked an announcement by the World Anti-Doping Agency that it added the drug to its banned list on Jan. 1, 2016. Because of the suspension, Sharapova lost her ranking. But she was given direct entrance to the main draw of the Stuttgart event, which she has won three times. Organizers at events in Madrid and Rome followed the example and handed her a wild card for their tournaments in May. Several players, including Vinci, criticized the invitation for a player who had been caught doping. Earlier Wednesday, Sharapova completed a one-hour training session on an empty center court. Because her suspension ended on Tuesday at midnight, she had not been allowed to use official tournament facilities before, forcing her to visit a tennis club in Stuttgart for training since last weekend.", "title": "Maria Sharapova Returns From Doping Ban With a Victory", "abstract": "In her first match after a 15-month suspension, Sharapova defeated Roberta Vinci, who had criticized Sharapova\u2019s receiving a wild card into the event.", "section": "Sports", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-26T14:45:15-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/sports/tennis/maria-sharapova-suspension-return-porsche-grand-prix.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T14:45:15-04:00"}
