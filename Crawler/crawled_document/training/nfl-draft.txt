{"abstract": "The goal is to look three years ahead, but with more players worried about serious injuries and leaving the game early, and a short shelf life at some positions, the task is difficult.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Derrick Johnson has always been a company man, willing to do whatever it takes to help the Kansas City Chiefs win playoff games and someday end their long Super Bowl drought. Restructure his contract? O.K. Tutor young linebackers? Sure thing. The point where Johnson, a linebacker, draws the line is in telling the Chiefs when he will finally hang up his cleats. At 34, Johnson is coming off a second season-ending Achilles\u2019 tendon injury, and he knows he is entering the twilight of his career. But he does not know if the end will come after the upcoming season, or the one after that, when his contract expires. \u201cI struggle with that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe older you get, the more you know it\u2019s coming to an end, at some point. But I just hope and pray when football is over for me, I can have peace and rest.\u201d Therein lies the challenge for the Chiefs, along with every other team in the N.F.L.: When is the right time to draft replacements \u2014 especially when extra roster spots have become invaluable, time limits on practice are more constrictive, and the pressure to win has never been greater? \u201cYou\u2019re always trying to work ahead and trying to prevent the roster from taking a major, major hit at any position. That\u2019s the nature of the National Football League,\u201d said Tennessee Titans General Manager Jon Robinson. \u201cAs veteran players age, or hit a level where they become maybe too expensive for your football team, that\u2019s something that you have to look at and manage.\u201d How teams manage it varies in just about every respect. First, there is the time frame. Teams try to forecast about three years ahead, but several general managers said that has become increasingly difficult. More players are walking away from the game early because of the increased risks of injuries and concerns over head trauma, while the shelf life of some positions may only be a few years to begin with, making it difficult to forecast even a year in advance. Players such as Johnson, who is entering his 13th season, are about as rare as the I-formation in an era when the N.F.L. Players Association reports that the average career lasts a little more than three years. Then there are positional differences. There are some jobs in which a player can be drafted and move into the starting lineup with little experience, while it may take others \u2014 quarterbacks, for example \u2014 several years of development before they are ready for games. Finally, there are philosophical differences. Teams such as the Green Bay Packers prefer to shore up holes almost exclusively through the draft, while others are more willing to dip into free agency. The draft carries the benefit of financial flexibility, but the downside is the pressure of enduring a crash course on life in professional football. \u201cYou can\u2019t predict the future,\u201d Robinson said, \u201cbut you just try to set yourself up so the rosters can kind of weather the storm of losing guys, and you can still play winning, productive football.\u201d Robinson is facing that challenge this off-season. Already, he has released cornerback Jason McCourty and begun the search for a replacement for the eight-year veteran. Tight end Delanie Walker is coming off a Pro Bowl season and is a 11-year veteran who will be 33 in August, so finding a replacement for him could become an issue soon. The Dallas Cowboys are another interesting case study in drafting replacements. A few years ago, they gambled that the running back DeMarco Murray would age quickly, and they let him go in free agency. The Cowboys struggled the following season \u2014 though it did put them in position to draft Ezekiel Elliott \u2014 while Murray ran for more than 1,200 yards with the Titans last season. The Cowboys also recognized that their injury-prone quarterback, Tony Romo, was nearing the end of his career, so they selected Dak Prescott in last year\u2019s draft. But any thought that Prescott was a developmental project quickly dissolved when he took over the starting job and never let it go. Dallas also tried unsuccessfully to draft an heir to tight end Jason Witten, but they missed on their second-round pick, Gavin Escobar. Witten is signed through 2021, but realistically, he only has a couple of seasons left. Witten\u2019s situation is not unlike Johnson\u2019s in Kansas City: a veteran player is still capable of playing at a high level, even if nobody is sure how long that will last. \u201cOne of the neat things we have going is we bring in good competition at all spots,\u201d Chiefs Coach Andy Reid said. \u201cThere are no positions absolutely guaranteed. I\u2019ll tell the rookies when they come in, \u2018You can cut it loose and see what happens,\u2019 and that covers all areas. \u201cIf a guy goes down, the next one comes in, and you have to maintain that \u2014 maintain that level of competition. And you obviously keep the best guys that create the most competition.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/sports/football/nfl-draft.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T20:03:39-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "In Replacing Productive Players, N.F.L.
