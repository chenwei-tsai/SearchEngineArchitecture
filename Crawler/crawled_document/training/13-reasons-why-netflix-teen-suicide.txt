Before her suicide, the \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d protagonist, Hannah Baker (played by the 20-year-old actress Katherine Langford), makes 13 cassette recordings to recount the agonies of her high school life. She then leaves the tapes behind, cataloging the misdeeds of those she finds guilty of ruining her life. \u201cWelcome to your tape,\u201d Hannah says as she reveals her latest antagonist. That line has become an online catchphrase. It has also introduced teenagers like Daniel Sanchez, 17, to a relic of the analog age. Earlier this month, Mr. Sanchez was walking through a Walmart near his home in Hayward, Calif., when he spotted a display of cassette tapes, which gave him the sort of big idea he had been hoping for. For some high school students these days, it is not enough to ask someone to go to the prom. You must do it up big. You must make a \u201cpromposal.\u201d Mr. Sanchez is a fan of \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d as is his girlfriend, Andrea Cerda, and when he saw those tapes, inspiration struck. He bought about $40 worth of cassettes and paid $24.88 for a tape recorder. \u201cI had to,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one really has those things around the house.\u201d He sat down with the oldfangled equipment and recorded his fondest memories of his times with Ms. Cerda, who is also 17. To make the promposal hang together, Mr. Sanchez made a sign, \u201c13 Reasons Why You Should Go To Prom w/ Me?\u201d Ms. Cerda appreciated her boyfriend\u2019s gesture so much that she posted photographs of the cassette tapes and the placard on Twitter. \u201cBest promposal ever! #13ReasonsWhy,\u201d she wrote. The post has been retweeted nearly 18,000 times. Her post ignited a fiery discussion, with some arguing that the promproposal was trivializing a serious issue. \u201cYou\u2019re romanticizing suicide and that\u2019s so messed up,\u201d one tweeter posted. \u201cYes, the suicide of a fictional girl on Netflix get over it,\u201d someone replied. A third person chimed in: \u201cA fake girl who is representing others! Girl these kids dont and wont understand till they mature.\u201d Ms. Cerda defended the gesture: \u201cThis promposal is not causing any harm, just shutup and get over it.\u201d The online response took her boyfriend by surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate this kind of a reaction,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think of the show as about suicide. We thought of it as entertainment. Then I read an article about how the show didn\u2019t do a good job making that clear and that it glorified things. Now I\u2019m thinking about things a little differently.\u201d The prom took place last weekend, and Ms. Cerda re-upped the promposal tweet with a photo of the couple, in school-dance attire, standing in front of a Mustang, the kind of car driven by one of the characters on the show. Ms. Cerda, a senior who plans to attend the University of California, Davis, in the fall, said she and her boyfriend were not diminishing the seriousness of depression and suicide. \u201cIt\u2019s entertainment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend. It\u2019s popular. No one really is going to die. It\u2019s a promposal.\u201d \u201cThirteen Reasons Why\u201d is based on the young-adult novel of the same title by Jay Asher. The actress Selena Gomez and her mother, Mandy Teefey, are among the executive producers. The show falls into the genre of entertainment aimed at adolescents that depicts a mix of partying, cliques, sex, sexual violence and self-harm. But unlike its cultural precursors \u201cABC Afterschool Specials,\u201d \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210,\u201d \u201cHeathers\u201d and \u201cCruel Intentions,\u201d the Netflix addition to the canon is, in many cases, watched by young people on phones or laptops without the awareness of their parents. Despite its weightiness, the show has inspired various jaunty memes. YouTubers have recorded \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d parody videos. Merchandisers on Etsy are hawking mugs that read \u201cJustice for Hannah\u201d and tank tops printed with the image of a cassette tape, the new vinyl. Endless threads on teenagers\u2019 Facebook feeds delve into whether Hannah is to blame for her own misery. And it can be a challenge to scroll through social media and not come upon the new dis, \u201cWelcome to your tape.\u201d For example, this post on Twitter: Instagram is awash in photos showing fingernails painted blue \u2014 the shade Hannah uses to paint numbers on her cassette tapes. (Ms. Gomez flaunted  blue-painted nails at the show\u2019s premiere last month.) One post shows nails done up in blue with ornate little designs related to the show. \u201cBlue nails in memory of hannah baker!\u201d the caption reads. Video shorts showing homemade slime in various designs are lately all the rage on social media, and a specialist in this subgenre, Brenden Urick, 31, has worked \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d into her slime-centric Instagram feed, Slimejellies. In a recent video, she shows a heap of slime molded to look like a cassette tape with the number 13 written in blue slime across its surface. Ms. Urick, of Tampa, Fla., said she watched \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d at the suggestion of her roommate, who heard it was a suspenseful mystery like the \u201cS-Town\u201d podcast series, which they had loved. Although she made a slime video related to the Netflix series, she does not count herself a fan. \u201cWe were hate-bingeing the show,\u201d Ms. Urick said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care for it. I yelled at the TV.\u201d She was annoyed by details she found unrealistic (\u201cWhy do 10th graders have so many tattoos?\u201d) and the lack of context for the plight of its protagonist. \u201cIt was about misplaced blame,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was not much in it about the role of depression and mental illness.\u201d But to build a sizable Instagram following, Ms. Urick must attract adolescents. As she put it: \u201cThere are a huge number of slime accounts there, and the majority of people who seem interested in slime seem younger.\u201d She included in the caption to her \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d-related video a suicide-prevention link: \u201cIf you or someone you know is in danger, please visit www.13reasonswhy.info to find out more.\u201d One impassioned online detractor of the show is Joshua Christmas, an 18-year-old high school junior in San Antonio. Given the issues at the heart of \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d he found the response, including Mr. Sanchez\u2019s promposal, to be inappropriately lighthearted. \u201cI doubt they had ill intentions,\u201d Mr. Christmas said of the promposaler, \u201cbut suicide is a really serious subject and it doesn\u2019t get talked about in a productive light and this doesn\u2019t help the conversation.\u201d He added that he himself hadn\u2019t watched the show or read the novel on which it is based, but he has read the character analyses and other discussions on his peers\u2019 Instagram and Twitter feeds. The show is also a big topic among parents. Robyn Seiferheld, 44, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said she first heard about it via a group-text message sent by the mother of a girl who studies dance with Ms. Seiferheld\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Zoe. The mothers were grappling with whether \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d was appropriate for their kids. \u201cI had never heard of it, so I assumed Zoe hadn\u2019t seen it,\u201d Ms. Seiferheld said. \u201cI asked her when she got home from school, and she said: \u2018Mom, I\u2019m almost done with the whole series. All my friends watch it, too.\u2019 It just goes to show you how much they do behind our backs.\u201d Ms. Seiferheld watched it herself so that she could discuss it with her daughter. As an adult who still thinks about a cousin who killed herself when they were both young, Ms. Seiferheld considers the show \u201cvery well done,\u201d she said, though too graphic for the young people who are attracted to it. \u201cSome of it, I\u2019m worried, is glamorizing of suicide, but if Zoe is talking to me about it, it makes me feel better,\u201d said Ms. Seiferheld, who recounted that her daughter sobbed her eyes out after watching the sad and shocking final episode. Zoe said she was glad her mother saw the show. \u201cI like talking about it with her,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly, we talk about the bullying and how some of the characters are really mean for not good reasons or no reason at all, and I don\u2019t understand why. My mom said you have to be careful what you say, because saying one thing you don\u2019t think is a big deal could have big impact on someone\u2019s life.\u201d", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
