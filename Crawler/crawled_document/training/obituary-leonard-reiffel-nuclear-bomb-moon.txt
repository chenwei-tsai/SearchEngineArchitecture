In sports broadcasting, Dr. Reiffel invented the Telestrator, which allows announcers to draw lines and circles on a television screen to show how a play developed. But even more compelling was his role in a top-secret study for the Air Force that asked a simple question: How about blowing up a nuclear bomb on or near the moon and seeing what happens? Soon after the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite into orbit in 1957, sending jitters throughout the United States that it was losing the space race, the Air Force posed the hypothetical question to a group of scientists, Dr. Reiffel among them. Project A119, as the study was called, secretly examined the scientific and military benefits of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile carrying a nuclear bomb the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima and detonating it on or near the surface of the moon. Whether that was even possible in the late 1950s is highly questionable. A lunar detonation, the study said, would serve military goals by supplying information about the \u201cdetection of nuclear device testing in space and concerning the capability of nuclear weapons for space warfare.\u201d As for the political impact, Dr. Reiffel, who was then the manager of physics research at the Armour Research Foundation, a laboratory that was part of the Illinois Institute of Technology, wrote in the panel\u2019s report in 1959 that \u201cpositive effects would accrue to the nation first performing such a feat as a demonstration of advanced technological capability.\u201d Spoiler alert: The plan was never executed and the moon survived, intact, to host six Apollo moon landings. Decades later, Dr. Reiffel revealed that the Air Force had been interested in staging a surprise lunar explosion, and that its goal was propaganda. \u201cThe foremost intent was to impress the world with the prowess of the United States,\u201d he told The New York Times in 2000. \u201cIt was a P.R. device, without question, in the minds of the people from the Air Force.\u201d Dr. Reiffel, who later helped NASA identify touchdown sites on the moon for the Apollo lunar module, died on April 15 at a hospital in Chicago. He was 89. Romayne Rickhoff, Mr. Reiffel\u2019s longtime assistant, said the cause was complications of pancreatic cancer. Dr. Reiffel (it\u2019s pronounced like rifle) was an inventor with dozens of patents, but the Telestrator resonated the most. For the broadcaster John Madden, the device was transformative, greatly enhancing his ability to describe what the 22 men on the football field were doing, especially the linemen battling at the line of scrimmage during a running play. As a former coach, Mr. Madden used the Telestrator at CBS Sports, then at other networks, to let viewers in on the sort of explanations he had given to his players. \u201cYou needed to identify the players with illustrations, not just words,\u201d Mr. Madden said in a telephone interview on Tuesday, recalling what he might say when he used the Telestrator to draw up a play: \u201cWatch this guy \u2014 he\u2019s going to go here, and this guy\u2019s going to come up from here and collide here, and the running back is going to go between them.\u201d Mr. Madden could be sloppy with his Telestrations as well as fanciful, sometimes using the tool to comically point out the Gatorade buckets on the sidelines, or the Thanksgiving turkey that he was going to eat after a game. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to do art,\u201d he said. Dr. Reiffel\u2019s forays into television, including one as the host of a local children\u2019s science show in Chicago, had inspired the Telestrator. He had grown frustrated with the limits of narrative voice-overs to describe what was being shown onscreen, and, he told Popular Mechanics in 2009, \u201cI decided it would be very nice to be able to get my hands in the picture and draw on it.\u201d The earliest version let Dr. Reiffel draw with a stylus on a transparent plastic sheet that was placed over a TV screen. It was coated so that electric currents could run over it. An image combiner merged the signals from the camera and pens. The device was first used successfully with weather reports, prompting Dr. Reiffel to approach the CBS station in Chicago about expanding its use into sports. The CBS network eventually embraced it for N.F.L. games. Mr. Madden first used it during the playoffs after the 1981 season and Super Bowl XVI. Dr. Reiffel stood nearby to make sure the Telestrator functioned well. As the large, excitable Mr. Madden drew on the Telestrator, \u201che almost knocked me right out of the announcer booth,\u201d Dr. Reiffel said in 2005 when he learned that he had won an Emmy Award in engineering for the invention. Dr. Reiffel\u2019s Telestrator eventually improved to let analysts use their fingers to sketch lines, circles and squiggles on a touch-screen monitor. It became an essential tool of onscreen sports production, along with instant replay, the electronic first-down line and the continuous score box. Leonard Reiffel was born in Chicago on Sept. 30, 1927. His father, Carl, was a silversmith, and his mother, the former Sophie Miller, was a district superintendent in the Chicago public school system. He earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology. His doctorate from the same school was in electrical engineering and physics. He is survived by his second wife, the former Nancy Jeffers, and his sons, Evan and David. His first marriage ended in divorce. During his varied career, Dr. Reiffel worked for a year at the University of Chicago for the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi; wrote a novel, \u201cThe Contaminant\u201d (1978), about a biomedical attack by rogue American officers against the Soviet Union; delivered radio commentaries on science that won a Peabody Award; consulted for the Apollo program\u2019s scientific staff; and ran a company that developed teleconferencing products. But the work he did at Project A119, where his hypothesizing yielded no tangible results, remains a Strangelovian reminder of Cold War tensions. In 2000, he recalled in the journal Nature when he and the others on his staff were asked to assess how the lunar surface and its chemistry would react to a nuclear bomb. \u201cThe cost to science of destroying the pristine lunar environment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cdid not seem of concern to our sponsors \u2014 but it certainly was to us, as I made clear at the time.\u201d", "title": "Leonard Reiffel, Who Studied Potential of a Lunar Nuclear Bomb, Dies at 89", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T19:27:18-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/obituary-leonard-reiffel-nuclear-bomb-moon.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00"}
