Is that why so many activists distrust him?", "text": "Last May, at the height of the Democratic presidential campaign, two weeks before the California primary, Bernie Sanders flew to San Bernardino, Calif., for a meeting with leading AIDS groups. The gathering was arranged by Peter Staley, the esteemed activist and founder of the Treatment Action Group, which in the 1990s helped speed the development of antiretroviral drugs. The meeting was called to secure the Sanders campaign\u2019s support for a spike in federal spending to combat AIDS, but as the session began, those in attendance were puzzled to find the conversation oddly strained. Sanders\u2019s demeanor, Staley recalled, \u201cwas very wary \u2014 he was very chilly when we shook hands.\u201d Sanders seemed to be churning internally about something until, dispensing with ceremony, he blurted out: \u201cLet me be blunt. Do any of you get money from the drug companies?\u201d The question was met with an awkward silence. Most AIDS organizations do accept grants from pharmaceutical companies \u2014 in some cases large ones. It is widely seen as a symbiotic relationship. AIDS nonprofits depend on funding from drug companies; drug companies depend on the organizations to educate patients about their wares. That arrangement rankled Sanders, who views the pharmaceutical industry as a public menace. In the primary, one of his signature issues was support for California\u2019s Proposition 61, a referendum that sought to control drug prices by barring public insurers from paying any more than the prices charged to the Veterans Health Administration, which traditionally gets a big discount. A few of the AIDS activists gathered in San Bernardino \u2014 along with a number of experts and patient groups \u2014 had strong reservations about the unintended consequences of that initiative. Some worried it would drain R.&D. budgets; others feared it would prod drug companies to jack up prices on veterans. Sanders did not share their reservations about Prop. 61. \u201cDrug companies are ripping off the American people in a big way,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are bad-news people, and they need to be taken on.\u201d The next day, the Sanders campaign circulated a news release about the meeting, which, to Staley\u2019s shock, focused entirely on Sanders\u2019s support for Prop. 61, and, in Staley\u2019s view, gave the misleading impression that everyone present joined Sanders in endorsing the referendum. After Staley took to Facebook to dispute the account \u2014 \u201cFeeling used and abused by the Sanders campaign right now,\u201d he wrote to 12,000 followers \u2014 the Sanders campaign\u2019s policy director, Warren Gunnels, attacked Staley personally on Twitter. Using scare quotes to insinuate that Staley, who once chained himself to a balcony of the New York Stock Exchange to protest high drug prices, didn\u2019t really deserve to be called an \u201cactivist,\u201d Gunnels claimed that Staley had \u201cmade a fortune from big drug companies.\u201d As evidence, Gunnels linked to a post on a website called Stop Pharma Greed that was teeming with opposition research on some of the biggest names in AIDS activism. The post accused Staley of \u201cshilling for big Pharma\u201d and taking funding from companies like DuPont Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences. \u201cIn short,\u201d the post concluded, \u201cStaley\u2019s livelihood since the year 2000 ... appears to have been wholly dependent on, or funded directly by, the drug industry.\u201d Staley called the accusation a \u201cTrumpian lie,\u201d noting that he has lived entirely on savings for the last five years. (The tweet was later deleted.) The activists hadn\u2019t known what to make of Sanders\u2019s frostiness, but as soon as they saw Gunnels\u2019s tweet, the fog lifted. Staley believed that someone had goaded the Sanders campaign into going nuclear on him, and he had no doubt about who that someone was. Stop Pharma Greed was funded by Staley\u2019s longtime nemesis, Michael Weinstein, the 64-year-old founder and director of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the world\u2019s largest and most controversial AIDS organization. (The Sanders campaign denied Staley\u2019s claim.) Weinstein was also the financier behind Prop. 61, which would go on to become the most expensive referendum of 2016, thanks to the pharmaceutical industry, which spent $120 million on the campaign, and eventually defeated it with 53 percent of the vote. More money was spent against Prop. 61 than was spent on behalf of any candidate for governor or Senate in 2016. Directors of health care nonprofits are traditionally cautious and courtly, fearful of choking the funding streams that issue from nit-picking grant committees and image-conscious donors. Weinstein, an ex-Trotskyite, is no courtier. He runs his organization as a \u201csocial enterprise,\u201d meaning that it generates most of its revenue not from grants and fund-raising but from adjacent businesses. A.H.F.\u2019s main business is a network of pharmacies and clinics that provide primary care to more than 41,000 patients in the United States, most of whom have their insurance claims paid by government insurance programs like Medicaid. The excess income from these patients helps the AIDS Healthcare Foundation provide free care to more than 700,000 H.I.V. patients internationally \u2014 the greatest reach of any AIDS organization. This prodigiously successful model has both insulated A.H.F. from typical funding woes and helped it to expand at an astonishing clip. Over the last six years, A.H.F.\u2019s budget has grown from $300 million to more than $1.4 billion, about the size of Planned Parenthood. If their projections hold, it will reach $2 billion by 2020, giving A.H.F. \u2014 a private entity effectively under the control of one man \u2014 a budget nearly half the size of the World Health Organization\u2019s. Paradoxically, that projected growth depends in part on whether drug costs remain high. While cutting drug prices is an ideological objective for Weinstein, his pharmacies stand to lose revenue should he succeed in that mission. \u201cMost of the time when people benefit from something, they don\u2019t lobby against it,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cBut we\u2019re Robin Hood. If someone was writing an epitaph for this organization some day, it will be: \u2018Bit the hand that fed it.\u2019\u2009\u201d A.H.F.\u2019s rapid ascent has made Weinstein an object of scorn among his peers, who deplore not only his tactics but also his unorthodox positions on public-health issues. Unlike nearly all other AIDS activists and public-health researchers, Weinstein opposes PrEP, the H.I.V.-prevention pill, which he believes will cause a \u201cpublic-health catastrophe\u201d by triggering a dangerous increase in risky sex. He has also campaigned to make condoms mandatory in adult films, even going so far as to introduce a statewide referendum in California, Proposition 60. Weinstein\u2019s positions have been assailed by peers as counterproductive fearmongering. \u201cIt reminds me very much of the Tea Party people with regard to Obamacare,\u201d Ernest Hopkins, director of legislative affairs for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, told me in 2013, referring to Weinstein\u2019s opposition to PrEP. \u201cIf you\u2019re prepared to say whatever you want and lie and demagogue and misrepresent the facts, then you can get a lot of airtime, and you can also persuade a lot of people.\u201d To his many critics in AIDS activism, Weinstein is the Koch brothers of public health: a mastermind driven by ideology, accountable to no one, with bottomless funds and an agenda marked by financial opportunism and puritanical extremes. It doesn\u2019t help that A.H.F. has been the subject of near-constant litigation and complaints for questionable business practices, including union-busting, giving kickbacks to patients, overbilling government insurers and bullying funders into denying grants to institutional rivals. (A.H.F. has denied these accusations.) To his faithful, however, Weinstein is not only a provider of superior health care but also an evangelist of moral urgency at a time when prevention efforts are floundering and drug prices are surging. Weinstein seems to view himself in loftier terms, as a holy warrior sent to save the innocent, not only from the scourge of H.I.V. but also from those he views as the virus\u2019s human collaborators: a satanic trifecta of greedy executives, vainglorious activists and incompetent bureaucrats. Weinstein\u2019s office, a cold and tidy room overlooking the Hollywood Hills, is an archive of sentimental zealotry. On his desk, an outward-facing plaque greets visitors with a defiant warning attributed to Hannibal \u2014 \u201cI shall either find a way or make one,\u201d a reference to herding war elephants over the Alps to destroy Rome. On one wall, a framed resolution from the California State Legislature honoring Weinstein for his community service hangs incongruously beside an orphaned sheet of paper printed with a Harry Truman-ism: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can accomplish when you do not care who gets the credit.\u201d Above the Truman quotation, there\u2019s a photo of Weinstein in front of the Taj Mahal, sitting alone in a red shirt; there are no photos of Weinstein\u2019s husband, a Vietnamese immigrant who owns a nail salon. A second piece of Scotch-taped paper bears an aphorism of Weinstein\u2019s own coinage: \u201cHelp Defeat Self-Imposed Helplessness.\u201d The first time I visited, in February of last year, Weinstein invited me to sit down without shaking my hand. A lean man with a long forehead, bird-of-prey features and a nerdy, pocket-protector vibe, Weinstein had a formal demeanor but was wearing jeans and a hoodie \u2014 a common outfit for a tech leader but unusual for a health care magnate. Weinstein took me on an abbreviated tour, proudly showing off photos he had taken with celebrities and political figures \u2014 Magic Johnson, Alicia Keys, former Senator Tom Harkin. Above his desk hung an Expressionist portrait of his best friend, with whom he founded A.H.F., Chris Brownlie. By all accounts, Brownlie was the softhearted yin to Weinstein\u2019s gladiatorial yang, as charming and consensus-seeking as Weinstein was splenetic and introverted. Brownlie died from AIDS-related complications in 1989. Weinstein has a long history of militancy. Born in Brooklyn\u2019s Bensonhurst neighborhood to a family of left-wing Jews, at age 13 he volunteered for an antiwar congressional candidate and worked as an equipment mule for his filmmaker sister, toting around a 40-pound battery while she shot footage of protesters burning draft cards in Central Park. The next year, he joined a group of activists occupying a new high-rise development to protest what was not yet known as gentrification. Though he realized he was gay early on, he repressed his sexuality for many years, eventually moving in with an older girlfriend. At age 18, he had his first gay encounter with an upstairs neighbor, also officially straight, who knocked on his door one night when both of their girlfriends were out of town. In 1972, when Weinstein was 19, he traveled to California and joined Los Angeles\u2019s gay activism scene. An outsider among both mainstream gays (for being a Marxist) and Marxists (for being gay), Weinstein decided to start his own group, which he called the Lavender and Red Union. The group eventually merged with a gay-friendly Trotskyite organization in New York called the Spartacist League, which offered Weinstein a leadership position, requiring him to move back to the East Coast. He wasn\u2019t at his new post for long, though, before he fell out with his comrades over an unusual matter: the Roman Polanski sexual-abuse case, in which the director was accused of drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. \u201cThey felt that it was not rape, that the girl knew what she was doing,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s boyfriend at the time, Albert Ruiz, told me. Weinstein believed it was rape and felt strongly enough about the matter, among other disputes, that he resigned. Disillusioned with activism, Weinstein briefly ran a candy business in Los Angeles before returning to politics to face an unlikely antagonist. In 1986, the right-wing conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche introduced a ballot referendum in California that would have enabled employers to fire people with AIDS and empowered the government to quarantine them. Early polling suggested that LaRouche\u2019s initiative had broad support. Along with Brownlie and other friends, Weinstein started his own group to fight LaRouche\u2019s proposition. In a move that anticipated his later shock-marketing campaigns, Weinstein distributed leaflets with the headline \u201cSTOP AIDS CONCENTRATION CAMPS\u201d and organized a torch-lit march on LaRouche\u2019s Silver Lake office. Mainstream gay activists abhorred Weinstein\u2019s strong-arm tactics, fearing he might alienate suburban voters. But after the measure lost in a landslide, with 71 percent opposed, L.A. Weekly named Weinstein \u201cBest Young Activist.\u201d Weinstein determined that there was far greater support for his militant approach than he had realized. As the AIDS crisis intensified, Weinstein watched more and more of his friends grow ill and die. Los Angeles County hospital had barely developed procedures for handling dying AIDS patients, and many were left to expire alone on gurneys in crowded hallways. Doctors and nurses would often refuse to care for AIDS sufferers, and when the untreated patients died, undertakers often turned them away, too. In some parts of the country, the deceased ended up in garbage bags delivered directly to crematories. Weinstein wanted to ensure that AIDS patients could die in a respectful, peaceful atmosphere. In 1989, he and Brownlie founded the precursor of A.H.F. \u2014 the AIDS Hospice Foundation. In 1990, as more AIDS medications became available, Weinstein changed the group\u2019s name to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and shifted its focus to medical care for the living. In the late \u201990s, little by little, A.H.F. expanded from Southern California into Florida and New York. Then, in 2000, A.H.F. made a change that would prove crucial to its business model: It opened its first pharmacy. Pharmacy services are, in Weinstein\u2019s words, A.H.F.\u2019s \u201cjet fuel.\u201d That\u2019s because 70 percent of spending on H.I.V. care consists of drug costs. While H.I.V. patients in the United States skew poor, the costly insurance claims they generate by filling prescriptions make them gold mines, not only for pharmaceutical companies but also for certain pharmacies, like Weinstein\u2019s, that take advantage of a federal program called 340B. Passed in 1991, 340B allows pharmacies attached to medical practices serving underprivileged populations to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at, on average, a 35 percent discount but still be reimbursed by insurers for 100 percent of the wholesale price. In effect, 340B allows pharmacies to keep around 35 percent of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s tab, a roundabout way of subsidizing health care for the poor. As the price of AIDS medications has spiraled upward in recent years, A.H.F.\u2019s coffers have swelled. The cost of the latest first-line H.I.V. treatment \u2014 a combination pill from Gilead called Genvoya \u2014 is about $34,000 per patient per year. When a patient uses an A.H.F. pharmacy, about $22,000 of that bill goes to Gilead, and $12,000 goes to A.H.F. The foundation\u2019s pharmacies serve 50,000 patients in the United States, generating approximately $1 billion each year in revenue \u2014 about $200 million of it surplus. That money subsidizes A.H.F.\u2019s expansion and advocacy as well as the group\u2019s political activities. The pool of potential patients for an organization like A.H.F. is oceanic. In 2014, 37,600 Americans were newly infected with H.I.V. That number has declined only slightly over the last decade, as America\u2019s epidemic has settled into a baleful equilibrium of slow growth and rising costs. The lack of progress is especially disheartening considering that H.I.V. medications, when properly administered, render patients almost totally noninfectious. These medications aren\u2019t new \u2014 they\u2019ve existed for two decades. If every infected American took them, our epidemic would be over. Instead, of the roughly 1.2 million Americans with H.I.V., only 40 percent are on medication, a rate lower than South Africa\u2019s. Weinstein believes that America\u2019s AIDS nonprofits, which he refers to derisively as \u201cAIDS Inc.\u201d \u2014 a label meant to evoke sclerotic incumbents who collect renewable grants and stand only for their own perpetuation \u2014 have been useless in the face of the epidemic. To win, he thinks, \u201cAIDS Inc.\u201d has to be sidelined so that A.H.F. can lead the way. Last spring, Weinstein summoned 30 foot soldiers to the Sheraton Hotel in New Orleans for a retreat for A.H.F.\u2019s sales team \u2014 a division that doesn\u2019t exist at most nonprofits because most nonprofits have nothing to sell. A.H.F. does: It sells health care to a customer base overwhelmingly composed of patients receiving government assistance, and each new patient it acquires means more cash for its operations. The sales team at A.H.F. is responsible for recruiting new patients, a function they perform by scouring homeless shelters, hosting parties at gay clubs, cozying up to local clinicians and deploying mobile-testing vans to H.I.V. hot spots. It\u2019s a commissions-driven gig. For each new patient who goes to an A.H.F. clinic and fills an antiretroviral prescription at an A.H.F. pharmacy, the rep receives $300. He or she receives an additional $300 when patients fill their prescriptions a second time \u2014 the second fill being a more reliable predictor of patient retention. To recruit new patients, sales reps are expected to hold several events each month, most of them in high-risk zones. Events vary by location. On Los Angeles\u2019s Skid Row, for example, reps hand out McDonald\u2019s gift cards to anyone willing to take a rapid H.I.V. test. In South Central, the reps sometimes set up a game called Cash Box, in which contestants who agree to a rapid test enter a plexiglass booth where they try to grab cash as it is blown around at high speeds. In gay neighborhoods, reps may invite passers-by to play Dildo Toss \u2014 a carny-inspired game in which players hurl phalluses of varying colors and sizes into a hole carved out of a plank of wood. \u201cWe give them three chances,\u201d explained Edwin Millan, director of sales for the Western United States, \u201cand if it goes in the hole, they get to spin a wheel and they get a prize.\u201d (In 2015, two former employees filed a whistle-blower suit arguing that A.H.F.\u2019s patient incentives amounted to illegal kickbacks; the lawsuit has not yet reached a resolution, and A.H.F. denies the claims.) In addition to seeking out patients directly, sales reps also cultivate referral sources by hosting lunches for area doctors. The retreat\u2019s kickoff dinner was held in the French Quarter, at Deanie\u2019s Seafood. Tucked away in a back room, the gregarious sales reps kibitzed noisily, slurping crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e as Weinstein, seated at the head of a long table, examined his battalion. Like other divisions at A.H.F., this group was anchored by black women in floral prints and gay men of all races in checkered shirts; many were new hires Weinstein was meeting for the first time. \u201cSometimes I have to pinch myself,\u201d Weinstein whispered to me, marveling at how swiftly his organization had expanded. As the sales reps emptied their plates and hailed waiters for second and third rounds of wine, Weinstein tapped his glass with a fork and called the group to attention. \u201cI\u2019d like to officially welcome you to the Big Easy!\u201d he squawked in his blunt Brooklynese. \u201cDo whatever you want as long as you wake up in the morning.\u201d The reps laughed. \u201cYou know, this is a really powerful force on behalf of the organization \u2014 a powerful force on behalf of the growth. Going out there, pounding the pavement, going after new accounts and clients \u2014 you have to be immune to rejection to be successful, and that\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m pretty bad at it myself!\u201d He wasn\u2019t kidding. Weinstein belies the clich\u00e9 that the best fighters develop a thick skin: He has sustained himself through decades of conflict by salting unhealed wounds, nursing unceasing resentment and preserving grudges in amber. The morning after the dinner, the sales reps reconvened in a dreary conference room with red tablecloths and damask carpeting. Programming for the first day called for an icebreaker in which employees were asked to scribble unusual facts about themselves on pieces of paper tossed into a hat. One man, a bodybuilder from South Beach with silver hair and pumpkin-colored skin, wrote that he used to train with Madonna; a copper-haired woman from San Francisco disclosed that she swam through garbage during an initiation ritual for Semester at Sea. Weinstein\u2019s own fact, the one he always uses for such exercises, was that he dropped out of high school. The icebreaker was followed by an exercise intended to explore how to navigate conversations with A.H.F.\u2019s critics. Weinstein gave volunteers the option of representing the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, leaders of which have been vocally critical of A.H.F., or a \u201cPrEP crazy,\u201d someone incensed by Weinstein\u2019s opposition to the H.I.V.-prevention pill. Another volunteer would play A.H.F. \u201cI\u2019ll be S.F.A.F.!\u201d volunteered the copper-haired woman. Her counterpart was a man whose upper lip was adorned with a sumptuous mustache. \u201cI\u2019m here to talk to you about the services that we provide,\u201d he began. \u201cI know all about A.H.F., actually,\u201d replied the copper-haired woman, her eyes narrowing. \u201cYour reputation precedes you.\u201d \u201cO.K., awesome. Did you know that we started the first AIDS hospice in Los Angeles about 28 years ago?\u201d he asked. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve grown rapidly, primarily overseas.\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019ve grown rapidly,\u201d she snapped, summoning a glower. \u201cYou\u2019re the Walmart of H.I.V.\u201d She went on: \u201cI\u2019ve been in the H.I.V. field for 30 years! I\u2019ve lived through the epidemic; I\u2019ve seen all my friends die. You guys advertise yourselves as this \u2018not-for-profit.\u2019 I know the true thing: You guys are a huge profit source. I can\u2019t even find your financials on your website \u2014 you hide those.\u201d The reps laughed; they\u2019d all heard some version of this tirade a thousand times. Weinstein took the floor and concluded the session by telling a little story about a nun he once met. She ran a hospital, which required her to make tough budgetary decisions in the name of helping people. Whenever people criticized her for being harsh, she had a canned response: \u201cNo margin, no mission!\u201d This, according to Weinstein, is what A.H.F.\u2019s critics couldn\u2019t bring themselves to understand. \u201cWe should never be in a position of apologizing for our success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we take a business model from the private sector and utilize it on behalf of a nonprofit is a great thing.\u201d This saintly narrative is complicated by the fact that Weinstein has drawn from his plentiful war chest to underwrite a dizzying number of controversial projects, some of which seem only tenuously connected to his core mission. In addition to the drug-pricing initiative and the condoms-in-porn bill, he filed a lawsuit against Gilead Sciences, the leading manufacturer of AIDS drugs, for patent manipulation (Gilead prevailed in court; A.H.F. has filed an appeal). He led a petition drive in Mississippi to remove Confederate symbols from the state flag, and he funded an anti-density campaign in Los Angeles that sought to halt construction on most new residential towers for two years, including a 28-story project across the street from Weinstein\u2019s global headquarters. And then there are the billboards. In major American cities \u2014 and increasingly, around the world \u2014 Weinstein\u2019s most visible impact is his trolling approach to sexual-health messaging. In 2013, he put up signs in several cities with the image of a magma-spewing volcano captioned, \u201cSYPHILIS EXPLOSION.\u201d The following year, in South Central, he posted billboards with two black men spooning in bed alongside the leading question \u201cTrust Him?\u201d Some ads have been humorous and topical \u2014 a sendup of the Netflix logo replaced with the mantra \u201cGet Tested and Chill,\u201d a Bernie Sanders parody with the modified slogan \u201cFeel the Burn?\u201d Others have hectored the public with reproachful questions: \u201cFriends With Benefits?\u201d \u201cSexually Reckless?\u201d \u201cWorried?\u201d One A.H.F. billboard managed to cause a national scandal in Uganda. Unusually for a nonprofit, A.H.F. employs a 15-person in-house creative agency to create its messaging. The expense is justified because the billboards are a marketing channel: They seek to stir dread in the libertine masses, not only to stem what Weinstein sees as a rising tide of promiscuity but also to drive traffic to his clinics. In the press, Weinstein has attracted the most attention for his hostility to PrEP, a once-a-day antiretroviral that reduces the likelihood of contracting H.I.V. by 99 percent. In 2015, the C.D.C. began recommending PrEP for anyone at \u201chigh risk\u201d for H.I.V. infection, including any gay man not in a monogamous relationship who has had sex in the last six months without a condom (1.2 million people, according to the C.D.C.\u2019s estimates). Many hailed it as an era-defining advance. Weinstein, virtually alone among major AIDS figures, has assailed PrEP, calling it a \u201cparty drug\u201d that could lead to a collapse in condom use. In a citizen petition to the Food and Drug Administration following PrEP\u2019s approval in 2012, A.H.F.\u2019s lawyer denounced the treatment as \u201cunsafe and ineffective.\u201d Weinstein called on Margaret Hamburg, the agency\u2019s commissioner, to resign over the issue, suggesting she was part of a pharma-led plot to put millions of Americans on a new medication. Weinstein\u2019s critique of PrEP is a fringe view. According to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, support for PrEP among researchers and regulators is all but universal. \u201cIt\u2019s having an extraordinarily positive impact,\u201d he says. Robert Grant, a professor of medicine at U.C.S.F. and a leading PrEP researcher, credits the treatment with \u201ca plummeting decline\u201d in H.I.V. transmission rates among white gay men in San Francisco. Nevertheless, Weinstein is quoted regularly in articles about the treatment, and his noisy skepticism has reverberated across the internet. Some argue that Weinstein\u2019s grandstanding during public hearings delayed PrEP\u2019s approval by the C.D.C., and that his sowing of doubt about the medication is continuing to suppress its use, especially in black and Latino communities. \u201cWhat I find in my practice,\u201d Grant says, \u201cis that A.H.F.\u2019s propaganda does not impress or influence privileged groups of gay men. They can see right through it. But when I talk to some people of color who are clients in my clinics, I find they\u2019ve heard the A.H.F. message, and it gives them pause, it makes them concerned, it appeals to their sense that this isn\u2019t for them.\u201d Despite the C.D.C.\u2019s efforts, very few people, even now, are on PrEP; according to recent estimates, only about 100,000 people take it. Weinstein\u2019s concerns about PrEP are in line with his other heterodox positions, which often cut against the sexual-liberationist doctrine embraced by other activists. Many issues that have been controversial in the gay community, he claims, like laws that make it illegal to intentionally infect a sexual partner with H.I.V., are no-brainers for ordinary voters. \u201cSome people are so extreme,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a group here in California that wants to reduce intentionally infecting somebody from a felony to a misdemeanor. There\u2019s articles being written basically saying we should be proud to bareback\u201d \u2014 slang for condomless sex. \u201cIn the hothouse environment of the gay community, that point of view is very popular, but it isn\u2019t in the community at large, and it isn\u2019t in the medical community either.\u201d What motivates Weinstein to adopt such lonely views? Weinstein\u2019s fiercest critics have often searched for a financial motive, some even going so far as to suggest that he aims to profit from the spread of H.I.V. Those who know him personally dismiss this explanation. Phill Wilson, president of the Black AIDS Institute, first met Weinstein in 1980 when Wilson was dating Chris Brownlie. In fact, the first iteration of A.H.F. was founded in Wilson\u2019s living room. \u201cThis is the mistake that people make when they think about Michael,\u201d Wilson told me. \u201cWhether what he does is good or bad, he does what he believes is in the best interests of people living with H.I.V. or at risk of infection.\u201d Weinstein was \u201cprimarily driven by mission,\u201d Wilson said. Even Peter Staley concedes that point. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the money for him,\u201d he told me, unsurprised to learn that in Weinstein\u2019s most recent annual report, he disclosed a comparatively humble salary of $400,000, low for directors of similarly sized nonprofits. \u201cThe core of the business at A.H.F. is not something that has been scandalous,\u201d Staley says. \u201cIt is an empire worth building. A.H.F.\u2019s problem is that once it created the largest AIDS empire on the planet, it started using that power for nefarious purposes: Michael Weinstein\u2019s twisted political views.\u201d On paper, 2016 was Weinstein\u2019s best year ever. He opened six new pharmacies and one clinic in the United States and started new programs in Indonesia, Bolivia and Zimbabwe. But on the advocacy side, he suffered significant setbacks. In November, his drug-pricing initiative failed. So did his condoms-in-porn initiative, despite the fact that he had managed to pass a similar law in Los Angeles County in 2012. Most recently, on March 7, voters in the city of Los Angeles resoundingly rejected, by a 2-to-1 margin, his quixotic anti-density measure. The public, it seems, is not on board with Weinstein\u2019s agenda. Even so, when I visited Weinstein at his office in February, he showed no sign of disappointment. Discussing recent losses, he wasn\u2019t merely philosophical; he was downright giddy. \u201cI had never been involved with a campaign,\u201d he said, referring to the drug-pricing initiative, \u201cwhere people were so enthusiastic about something that didn\u2019t win.\u201d (He would later use the same line with reporters when his anti-density ordinance went down in flames.) As we chatted, he sipped from a radioactive-looking bottle of apple-melon Isopure; he said he liked his chances for this November, when he would try again with a new drug-pricing initiative, this time in Ohio. The problem in California, he said, was that the drug companies had flooded the airwaves \u2014 \u201ctotal aerial bombardment, 3,500 gross rating points a week\u201d \u2014 but he doubted that kind of \u201crazzmatazz\u201d would work in flyover country. \u201cMidwesterners are kind of square-shouldered, common-sense people. I\u2019d think there\u2019d be a backlash if they dumped $80 million into Ohio.\u201d If that referendum were to pass, Weinstein figured, then Big Pharma\u2019s citadel \u2014 the American market \u2014 would start to crack. Ohio would be copied by other states, and the V.A.\u2019s price for drugs would become the universal price, as even private insurers would demand to pay the new public rate. Billions would be shaved off pharma\u2019s bottom line, meaning the industry would no longer have the muscle to bully Congress into propping up its international patent regime. Drug prices would plummet across the world, AIDS medications would flow freely and the industry\u2019s lobbying operation would shrink so much that it could be drowned in a bathtub. This sequence of events seemed far-fetched, but Weinstein was nevertheless optimistic about the coming year, win or lose. His equanimity in the face of failure reminded me of something he once said to me about Prop. 60, the condoms-in-porn bill. It lost at the ballot box by an eight-point margin, but Weinstein found a reason to declare victory. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more than 10,000 stories on condoms in porn,\u201d he boasted. \u201cForget about porn: That\u2019s a lot of free advertising for condoms.\u201d Weinstein often consoles himself in moments of defeat by reaffirming his commitment to the long game. This is part of what makes him so frustrating to his critics: It is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to distinguish his cynical ploys from his ideological commitments. In his person, the will to power and the will to change the world seem to fuse. It wasn\u2019t simply that he cared more about fighting than about winning. Eventually, he believes, people will come around to his view. And if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine, too: A.H.F. will continue to thrive, even in a fallen world.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/magazine/the-ceo-of-hiv.html", "material_type_facet": "News", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:12-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "title": "The C.E.O. of H.I.V.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:12-04:00"}
