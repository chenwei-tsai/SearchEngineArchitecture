At what point does fortitude (all those chapters, drawings, songs) pass into life-destroying intransigence? And, oh God, what if you are not even so offbeat? What if every time you walk into an espresso bar, you spy a dozen tortured humans in black knitwear who seem as miserable as you are? What if your life is a portable anthology of clich\u00e9s? The Irish writer Sara Baume, in her second novel, \u201cA Line Made by Walking,\u201d picks up these sorts of eternal questions, packs them into her rucksack and carries them quite a long way. Her novel is about Frankie, who is 25, cries all day and rolls around the carpet of her rented room like a small, gut-shot mammal. Frankie has studied art in Dublin, where she dressed the part: \u201cA ring through my lip, a ring through my nose, a pair of oxblood Doc Martens.\u201d Another sort of writer might send Frankie up, might make of her an object of aspirational satire. (Samuel Beckett described tears as \u201cliquefied brain.\u201d) But Baume takes her seriously indeed, and we follow her down a rabbit hole of elegiac quarter-life distress. Frankie is shocked to find how easily wounded she is. As a child she was a sort of spiky warrior princess. \u201cI was grubby and scab-kneed with a bedroom full of caged animals,\u201d she says, \u201cand in college I learned to use all the big electric drills and wood-saws in the sculpture department and to weld.\u201d But now her art is not going well; there are no emails in her inbox; a boy she liked is with someone else; she is avoiding the few friends she has. \u201cI am not,\u201d she frets, \u201cremotely impressive.\u201d She feels like a canceled postage stamp. Worse than being unimpressive, she senses she\u2019s a fraud. Referring to her family, whose members not only put up with but love her, she declares: \u201cI feel guilty that I am granted the immunity of the artistically gifted, having never actually achieved anything to prove myself worthy.\u201d If you\u2019ve ever looked inside yourself and disliked what you saw, you will respond to Frankie. She decides she must get out of Dublin. Some rustication is in order. She flees to a rural house once owned by her grandmother, and settles in. At this point \u201cA Line Made by Walking\u201d becomes a wallow, a trunk of oozing funk, a narrative in which very little happens. I\u2019m a fan of a good wallow, in fiction. But by its midpoint, Baume\u2019s novel begins to stall. Rot and claustrophobia set in. It\u2019s a major event in this novel when the doorbell rings. Frankie stumbles onto a new art project. She begins to photograph dead animals, sometimes scaring the locals while doing so. She angers the locals, too, by being a sarcastic gut-shot mammal. \u201cDo you get up every morning,\u201d she asks the woman who is cutting her hair, \u201cand do that to your hair? Do you undo it at night and then, the next morning, do you get up and do it all over again?\u201d The woman does not answer. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that leach at your soul?\u201d Frankie whispers. \u201cEven a little bit, even at all?\u201d Do not anger the person with sharp scissors near your skull, even if you can weld. The woman gets revenge by giving Frankie a gruesome haircut. Frankie\u2019s sunny side is rarely up. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like it,\u201d she realizes, \u201cwhen you say real things.\u201d Yet you may wish more real things were said in \u201cA Line Made by Walking.\u201d It\u2019s the work of an intelligent writer who strands her character in the intellectual and moral horse latitudes. Frankie begins to speak for the reader, by thinking things like \u201cHow could I have known that peace could become so boring?\u201d Also: \u201cI lie down and think about how this whole long, strange summer ought to end in a substantial event.\u201d To keep her mind sharp, Frankie tests herself by calling to mind artworks on a variety of subjects: birds, stars, sky, hair, penises. These interludes fill a lot of space in this volume, and they quickly come to seem like filler. Toward the end, there\u2019s a sense that Baume has begun to vamp in order to fill space. \u201cI can\u2019t believe there are so many types of floss,\u201d Frankie thinks while at the drugstore. Outside, she asks: \u201cHow do the flowers know it\u2019s nighttime? Why is the moon everywhere?\u201d You can be an admirer of what Anthony Burgess called \u201cthe poetry of digression\u201d and still ask yourself: Why does this talented author sometimes seem to be writing for children\u2019s board books? Baume has a rare sort of feeling for outcasts. Her first novel, \u201cSpill Simmer Falter Wither\u201d (2015), about a shunned man and his one-eyed dog, had a strange and stark emotional potency. So does, at its best, \u201cA Line Made by Walking.\u201d Frankie admits to a friend her fear that \u201call this stupid sadness is chewing at my intellect.\u201d Her friend replies that it may be time to let her art go. \u201cShe meant: It\u2019s time to postpone \u2014 if not entirely abandon \u2014 my burden of unrealistic ambition. To start churning the intellect I have left into simply feeling better; to make this my highest goal. It\u2019s time to accept that I am average, and to stop making this acceptance of my averageness into a bereavement.\u201d In interviews, Baume has said that this novel is vaguely autobiographical. Maybe Frankie will grow up to be a writer as well, the reader thinks, and churn her despair into something prickly and profound, a line to walk out of pain and loss.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/books/review-line-made-by-walking-sara-baume.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:59:49-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "title": "An Artist Fears She\u2019s a Fraud in \u2018A Line Made by Walking\u2019", "item_type": "Article"}
