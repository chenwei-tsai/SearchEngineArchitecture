After squeaking out the opener by a point, LeBron James and the Cavaliers showed more intensity on defense and more swagger in general in winning their 10th straight first-round playoff game over the past three seasons. However, they nearly blew an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter as the Pacers cut the gap to 4 before Cleveland closed out the game at the line. James had 10 rebounds and seven assists, but he also had eight of Cleveland\u2019s 19 turnovers. Game 3 is set for Thursday night. Paul George scored 32 points and Jeff Teague 23 for Indiana, which showed more fight but has a steep hill to climb to get back into the series. Cleveland is 12-0 when starting 2-0 in the postseason. The Cavaliers vowed they would play better after their near disaster in Game 1, and they backed up their talk, delivering the kind of performance that was routine last season but has been very rare in 2017. Love scored 10 straight points and drew a charging foul on Lance Stephenson in a span of two minutes as the Cavaliers opened an 89-70 lead. Irving closed the third quarter by hitting a 3-pointer over Stephenson, and he made sure Stephenson knew about it, yapping in his direction long after the horn sounded. The Cavaliers still led, 109-91, with 6 minutes 9 seconds left, but the Pacers scored 13 straight points and trimmed their deficit to 113-109 when George hit a 3-pointer with 20 seconds left. It continued a disturbing trend for the Cavaliers, who have been giving up big, late leads with regularity. The other hitch for Cleveland was that the starting guard J. R. Smith did not play in the second half because of a left hamstring injury. Iman Shumpert, who sat for the opener, replaced Smith and played 20 solid minutes. Although his team had lost the opener, Coach Nate McMillian insisted the Pacers had not lost any confidence. \u201cWe believe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe came in believing; we still believe.\u201d It just got a lot harder. A TEST FOR THE CELTICS Last week, the Boston Celtics were the toast of the Eastern Conference after outlasting the Cleveland Cavaliers, the reigning champions, for the top seed and home-court advantage. Then, the day before Boston\u2019s playoff opener, the sister of guard Isaiah Thomas was killed in a car accident. That has created a delicate balancing act. This is a team that expected to be riding a big wave of momentum. Instead, Boston lost, 106-102, to Chicago in Game 1, and the possibility looms that the Celtics will fall into an 0-2 hole on Tuesday. But if there is a group built for such a challenge, it would seem to be this one. There is empathy in the locker room, and a coach adept at navigating rough water. \u201cI think the biggest thing is they really care about each other,\u201d Coach Brad Stevens said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough when he\u2019s sitting there and some of his family is back in Seattle.\u201d He added, \u201cBut I think the next extension of your family is who you\u2019re around every day, and your team.\u201d Stevens said Thomas planned to play in Game 2 on Tuesday night and then head to Washington State to be with his family and help complete funeral arrangements. \u201cThey care about one another,\u201d Stevens said of his players, \u201cand they support one another. That\u2019s what you hope you have in a team, but it\u2019s probably not always the case.\u201d Thomas\u2019s sister, Chyna, died early Saturday in a one-car accident outside Tacoma. No funeral date is set, but Stevens said the Celtics planned to attend. Thomas attended a film session and walk-through Monday but did not speak with reporters. Stevens said that after services for Thomas\u2019s sister, he intended to rejoin the team Friday for Game 3 in Chicago. Stevens, however, stressed that all plans were up to Thomas. Thomas, after an unsteady beginning, played admirably in Game 1, with 33 points, 6 assists and 5 rebounds.", "abstract": "Kyrie Irving had 37 points, and Cleveland prevailed despite nearly squandering an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter against Indiana.", "section": "Sports", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/sports/basketball/cavaliers-beat-pacers-game-2.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Cavaliers Hold Off Pacers to Take a 2-0 Lead", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T22:54:24-04:00"}
