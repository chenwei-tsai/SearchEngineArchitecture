In 1980, the artist constructed a fake resin boulder, dubbed \u201cRocky II,\u201d which he hid in the Mojave Desert, the hunt for which is the subject of an upcoming feature film by Pierre Bismuth. In that same arid vein comes Ruscha\u2019s latest, and equally unorthodox, outing: the recipe for a cactus omelet that will be served for lunch, for five consecutive Saturdays beginning this weekend, to visitors at the Barbican Art Gallery in London. It\u2019s his quirky contribution to fellow Californian artist Doug Aitken\u2019s collaborative exhibition, \u201cStation to Station: A 30 Day Happening,\u201d which also sees a series of art yurts (and Beck) installed at the Brutalist mecca this summer. \u201cI grew up in Oklahoma where things were really simple,\u201d says Ruscha of his culinary roots. \u201cNobody ate cactus at all. It wasn\u2019t until I was a little older that I realized it\u2019s sold at the market and it\u2019s actually very good. It has the same sliminess as okra, and it mixed well with eggs, so I thought: \u2018Why not just slice these things up?\u2019\u201d Ruscha\u2019s recipe, which he shares below, specifies the use of nopalitos, a relative of the prickly pear, which is calorie-light and antioxidant-rich, and has been a mainstay of Mexican cooking for centuries. But, for the uninitiated, how does cactus actually taste? \u201cIt\u2019s like biting into a watermelon,\u201d he explains. \u201cSome people treat it like a fine wine. I don\u2019t drink wine, but I can see that it has subtleties that would appeal to lots of different people.\u201d The making of the cactus omelet has become something of a ritual for Ruscha when staying at his desert home close to the Joshua Tree National Monument. \u201cWhen I first started out here, L.A. was like the Australia of the art world,\u201d he says of the city that he\u2019s called home for almost 60 years. \u201cNow it\u2019s moving faster and faster and it can drive you crazy. So I have to get out to the desert and have myself an elixir of cactus omelet.\u201d Though Ruscha is the first to admit that the recipe sidesteps his other work, he adds in his typically unaffected style: \u201cIf you make it right it can be an artful creation, just like a painting can be tasty.\u201d \u201cStation to Station: A 30 Day Happening\u201d takes place June 27-July 26 at the Barbican, Silk Street, London EC2Y 8DS, barbican.org.uk/stationtostation.
