{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cChoate Admits Sexual Abuse Over Decades\u201d (front page, April 14): As a Choate Rosemary Hall alumna (class of 1999), I read your report detailing a history of adult sexual misconduct at Choate \u2014 some of it perpetrated by teachers I had, and on students who were my contemporaries \u2014 with a feeling of devastation and heartbreak. I never suffered any such abuse, nor anything remotely approaching it. But some of what\u2019s described happened while I was there, and some incidents in the longer investigation report circulated to alumni and others are reminiscent of rumors or insinuations I heard as a student. Of the 12 faculty members named, three were my teachers, and one I considered a special mentor and supporter. Like Cheyenne Montgomery, I was an unusual student at Choate, having come from much lesser means than many of my classmates. In short: The report hits close to home, even for a student lucky enough to have avoided abuse, and I shudder to acknowledge that more brave survivors will undoubtedly come forward in the wake of this article and the investigation report. I laud the courage and honesty of those who have shared painful and traumatic stories of abuse and misconduct. They shatter my very fond memories and my feelings of trust and respect for Choate and its faculty \u2014 feelings I was lucky not to have had trampled long ago as a teenager, as was the case for the 24 survivors cited in the report. CAITLIN BOYLE, PORTLAND, ORE. To the Editor: Choate deserves credit for hiring an outside law firm to investigate and then expose 12 former teachers who over several decades abused students at the school. But as made clear in that law firm\u2019s report, Choate continues to shelter the leaders who bear ultimate responsibility for this legacy. First, Choate withheld from the investigating firm 25 years of consultations its leadership had with legal counsel about reports of abuse; it did not report these allegations to the authorities until 2010. Second, the law firm\u2019s mandate from Choate excluded analyzing \u201cwhether Choate or any individuals affiliated, or previously affiliated, with the school violated any laws.\u201d Indicative of the school\u2019s failure to come to grips with leadership\u2019s responsibility is the fact that two of the former headmasters who presided over the school during the years of abuse continue to serve Choate as \u201clife trustees.\u201d TAYSEN VAN ITALLIEPRINCETON, N.J. To the Editor: I was a student at Choate in the 1950s while it was an all-boys\u2019 school. One of the teachers mentioned by name in your article was my sixth-form housemaster. Sadly, he is deceased, and this blot upon his memory will outlast his distinguished teaching career at Choate. Naming and staining his reputation does no honor to the school or to that teacher\u2019s legacy of academic and professional expertise. \u201cThe evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones. So let it be with \u2026\u201d DAVID H. NICHOLSMANCHESTER, VT. To the Editor: I cannot help but reflect on the difference between how sexual abuse has been dealt with (or not dealt with) by elite prep schools and by the New York City public schools. Going back to the mid-1980s all New York City schools were required to post warnings about \u201csexual harassment\u201d and principals were required to investigate all reports of possible abuse. Of course, in a system with over a million students some abuse was bound to occur. But it was not deliberately concealed by school authorities \u2014 and if it was, they lost their jobs. I know because I was one of many teacher coordinators assigned to help principals investigate complaints. Teachers and administrators who committed such acts were immediately removed from their classroom or office \u2014 and away from students. I think that in the case of the elite private schools (Horace Mann, St. George\u2019s, Choate etc.), the chief concern of the school community has been to protect the institution, with action only taken as a result of massive media exposure. The emphasis in our public schools was to protect the students.
