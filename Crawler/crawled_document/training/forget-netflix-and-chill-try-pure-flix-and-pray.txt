R. White and Andrea Logan White requested a pause. \u201cHold on, I want to say grace,\u201d Mr. White said to this reporter, whose mouth was already stuffed full of bacon. \u201cBless us, Lord, thanks so much for this day,\u201d he went on, concluding: \u201cI love you. Thanks so much for the movie.\u201d The disconnect between the mainstream news media and evangelical Christians is also a major theme of \u201cThe Case for Christ.\u201d Based on the best-selling book written by Lee Strobel, a former journalist at The Chicago Tribune, the movie depicts his process of going from a hard-nosed newsman and atheist to a devout Christian and minister. It was produced by Pure Flix, a faith-based entertainment production and distribution company in Scottsdale, Ariz., that Mr. White helped found in 2005. In June 2015, the company introduced an on-demand streaming service. While Netflix denizens devour series like \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d PureFlix.com offers bingeable programming like \u201cThe American Bible Challenge,\u201d a game show hosted by Jeff Foxworthy; \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d a sitcom starring Brian Keith that ran from 1966 to 1971; \u201cThe Encounter,\u201d a Pure Flix original scripted series about people who are visited by Jesus; and stand-up comedy from Sinbad and Louie Anderson. Next up is \u201cHilton Head Island,\u201d a soap opera starring Antonio Sabato Jr. It also streams sermons and documentaries for parents who home-school. Last month, PureFlix.com had nearly 715,000 unique visitors, according to Alexa, a website traffic analytics company. Greg Gudorf, chief executive of PureFlix.com, said the service\u2019s nearly 250,000 paying subscribers could choose from a catalog of more than 7,500 titles. \u201cWe\u2019ve been blessed with really strong growth,\u201d he said. Mr. White, whose book, \u201cBetween Heaven and Hollywood,\u201d was published last fall by Zonverdan, wants to make films, sitcoms and serialized dramas with family-friendly or religious messages. \u201cOur God-given dream was to provide content on a consistent basis to be an alternative to what Hollywood was putting it out,\u201d he said. Mr. White, who was raised a Mennonite in rural Kansas, saw just one secular film in a theater before he turned 18. (\u201cThe Mennonites make the Mormons look like a pack of Hell\u2019s Angels,\u201d he said.) A friend\u2019s parents took him to see \u201cGrease\u201d and \u201cwhen Olivia Newton-John came out in black tights and I thought for sure I was going to hell,\u201d he said. This was enough to persuade him to drop out of Bible college after one year. His goal was to serve God through acting, but then he became interested in production, too. Pure Flix has made hundreds of films (\u201cDo You Believe?\u201d starring Cybill Shepherd), sitcoms, serialized dramas and web series including \u201cOn the White Track,\u201d which stars Mr. White and his wife. On-demand services allow Christians of different disciplines to find content that speaks to their individual interests and beliefs. A theatrical feature film can be a tougher sell to a religious population with many different denominations. \u201cIn the Christian faith, there are divisions with all the sects,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThe Baptists won\u2019t talk to the Assemblies of God. You have your charismatic Christians. You have your ultraconservatives, like Southern Baptists. You have Catholicism. They\u2019re all a little different.\u201d But, he added, invoking the Rev. Billy Graham, \u201cThe foot of the cross is level ground.\u201d The 2014 Pure Flix theatrical release \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead\u201d found the level ground. It earned more than $60 million at the box office. (Mr. White was a star of the film, and it features Korie and Willie Robertson of \u201cDuck Dynasty.\u201d) \u201cThe Case for Christ\u201d also focuses on a theme that binds all Christians, the resurrection of Jesus. Set in 1980 and decked out with the cars, pastel clothes, handlebar mustaches and smoky newsrooms that conjure the dawn of Reagan\u2019s America, the movie was filmed over six weeks in Atlanta and cost more than $4 million to make. It stars Mike Vogel (recently of the Syfy network\u2019s mini-series \u201cChildhood\u2019s End\u201d), the Tony-winning actress L. Scott Caldwell and Erika Christensen (known for her six-season work on the NBC show \u201cParenthood\u201d). There are cameos from Robert Forster and Faye Dunaway. On the film\u2019s marketing poster, Mr. Vogel\u2019s character gazes at a red Time magazine cover from 1966 that asks, \u201cIs God Dead?\u201d (As it happens, Time repurposed the cover for a March 2017 edition, but the modern-day headline read, \u201cIs Truth Dead?\u201d) The film earned mostly favorable reviews from the small mainstream publications. It received an A-plus CinemaScore, measuring audience appeal, and has a 77 percent favorability mark from Rotten Tomatoes. By the end of its first two weekends in more than 1,000 theaters around the country, the movie had brought in about $9 million, perhaps less than Mr. White and his partners had hoped for but still delivering a tidy profit. Thanks to President Trump\u2019s popularity among evangelicals and discussions of \u201cfake news\u201d abounding on the internet, the film has considerable resonance. \u201cIf you watch CNN or Fox, you feel like it\u2019s two different worlds,\u201d said Michael Scott, a founder of Pure Flix and a producer of the film. \u201cHere, you have something similar, you have an atheistic journalist investigating the claims for Christ. There are some similarities even though it was taking place more than 30 years ago.\u201d Speaking near the red carpet before the screening, Mr. Scott, also the chief executive of Pure Flix, was upbeat and gregarious, if a little nervous. Soon he would need to introduce the film with a list of thank yous \u201cas long as the Bible,\u201d he said. He was standing with Shawn Boskie, who was a pitcher with the Chicago Cubs and is Pure Flix\u2019s vice president for investor relations. (A Q. and A. session after the screening was conducted by Kirk Cousins, a quarterback for the Washington Redskins.) Mr. Scott was wearing a red-stripe tie that Mr. Boskie bought for him at Trump Tower in New York. Earlier in the evening, Mr. Scott had been yearning for a pair of scissors to help nip a tag hanging from the back of the tie. He didn\u2019t want to just yank it off. \u201cThe tie was made in China,\u201d he said. Us Weekly was not represented on the news media line, but The National Catholic Register and Movieguide were. \u201cThis is like \u2018All The President\u2019s Men\u2019 journalism before so much of it was doubted and before there were so many different journalists writing for so many different media,\u201d said Jon Gunn, the movie\u2019s director, of his protagonist\u2019s search for answers. \u201cBack when people had notebooks and pens and spoke face to face.\u201d But the film\u2019s character connects to modern opinions of the news media, too, he said. Mr. Strobel\u2019s character \u201cis a skeptic who says he\u2019s being evenhanded and unbiased but he\u2019s looking to debunk Christianity so he\u2019s not as unbiased as he should be.\u201d Mr. and Ms. White sidled up to Mr. Gunn and his wife, Lisa, to say hello. Mr. Gunn and Mr. White have known each other for years. Mr. White starred along with Eric Roberts in 2000\u2019s \u201cMercy Streets,\u201d Mr. Gunn\u2019s first feature film, in which Ms. Gunn, an actress, also had a role. \u201cI got to make out with his wife for \u2018Mercy Streets,\u2019\u201d Mr. White said with a big laugh. Mr. Gunn said, \u201cAndrea and I are still waiting for our turn.\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s getting chilly in here,\u201d Mr. White said. Ms. White, who met her husband at a church in Malibu, Calif., when she had blond dreadlocks and was working as a personal trainer, rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a rainbow-and-unicorn Christian,\u201d she said later. The world of faith-based entertainment feels small and interconnected in this way. Eamonn McCrystal is an Irish tenor whose music career is managed by Elizabeth Travis, the country singer Randy Travis\u2019s ex-wife and ex-manager who is also a Pure Flix partner. Mr. McCrystal, who played an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in Pure Flix\u2019s \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead 2,\u201d strolled amid the friends and family of the film\u2019s cast and crew as Ms. Travis walked the red carpet. He carried a cellphone in a leather case that made it look like a little Bible. \u201cOh, you\u2019re the one that Donald Trump hates,\u201d he said after meeting a reporter for The New York Times. Brian Bird, the film\u2019s writer, was an executive producer of \u201cTouched by an Angel\u201d and worked on programs including \u201cStep by Step\u201d and \u201cEvening Shade,\u201d the Burt Reynolds sitcom that was broadcast on CBS from 1990 to 1994. When he was in his early 20s, Mr. White had a recurring role on \u201cEvening Shade\u201d until he stuffed a pillow under his shirt and did an impersonation of Mr. Reynolds in front of the studio audience before filming an episode. Mr. Reynolds turned his rings around and smacked Mr. White on the ear with his open palm. Mr. White was subsequently fired. Now Mr. Reynolds plays Mr. White\u2019s father on a new sitcom Pure Flix is trying to shop to the networks, a 10-episode season of which has already been shot. In \u201cHitting the Breaks,\u201d Mr. White plays a former racecar driver who moves with his family from Atlanta to a small town in Colorado, where he has inherited a bed-and-breakfast, the Serenity Inn. His real-life wife plays his wife on the show. Morgan Fairchild, Rob Schneider and Tim Tebow have guest-starred. Mr. and Ms. White would also like to star in a reality show. After the success of \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead\u201d in 2014, they took meetings with network executives but the discussions went nowhere. In part \u201cit was a faith thing,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThe major networks like the audience of faith,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut when you have to go to the audience and say faith things on television, well, we might be too open.\u201d Ms. White responded, \u201cThey\u2019re worried we\u2019ll make the audience uncomfortable, like Jesus freaks.\u201d \u201cI think the climate is different now,\u201d Mr. White said of producing a reality show based on an evangelical Christian family. \u201cI think it eventually will happen.\u201d Pure Flix executives are also building a strategy to attract a secular audience so that its content is not mere \u201cpreaching to the converted,\u201d said Alysoun Wolfe, another of the company\u2019s partners. This fall, Pure Flix will release in theaters \u201cSame Kind of Different as Me,\u201d starring Greg Kinnear and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and featuring Jon Voight. It also has been filming \u201cSamson,\u201d starring Rutger Hauer, Jackson Rathbone,  Lindsay Wagner and Billy Zane, in South Africa. And Ms. Wolfe, with Mr. Scott, is focusing on the start of Epiphany, a production partner to Pure Flix whose subtler brand name is intended to avoid alienating non-Christians. \u201cWe need to reach a broader audience,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said, \u201cbecause we want to get the moral lessons out.\u201d", "section": "Style", "title": "Forget Netflix and Chill.
