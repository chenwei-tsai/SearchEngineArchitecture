But in her review of \u201cThe Campus Rape Frenzy\u201d (April 9), Jill Filipovic is merciless in her criticism of its authors, KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor Jr., for their use of anecdotal evidence about men falsely accused of date rape in order to call attention to the ruinous effect of such denunciations. Yet any practicing psychiatrist or defense lawyer can easily confirm similar examples. The tendency to view women as inevitably the victims of sexual assault leads to an unbalanced response to any claim of rape, without any evaluation of the complex and destructive motives that may underlie such accusations. To dismiss this book and denounce its authors only perpetuates the myth that due process actually occurs on our university campuses. In doing so, the reviewer contributes to a pernicious dichotomizing of men as sexually bad and women as always innocent in their pursuit of \u201cjustice.\u201d HENRY J. FRIEDMAN CAMBRIDGE, MASS. The writer is an associate professor of psychiatry, part time, at Harvard Medical School. \u2666 To the Editor: Gordon G. Chang\u2019s review of Michael J. Green\u2019s \u201cBy More Than Providence\u201d (April 9) reinforces the myth Green advances of a \u201clong-term American commitment to supporting democratic norms in the region.\u201d Down Chang\u2019s memory hole has gone the Eisenhower administration\u2019s refusal to abide by the 1954 Geneva Accords\u2019 call for a national election in Vietnam because Ike feared Ho Chi Minh would win with 80 percent of the vote. Then followed the succession of American-backed dictators, the killing of some three million Indochinese and the poisoning of the land with Agent Orange and other defoliants in a futile war to prevent the reunification of Vietnam. Would we describe the decades of American imposition of and support for military dictators in South Korea, or support for the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines, as what Chang terms \u201csharing American ideals\u201d? America\u2019s Asia-Pacific hegemony has been constructed via coercion: conquest, colonization, occupation and more subtle forms of imperialism. Building foreign and military policies on the basis of delusions and fallacies is nationally self-defeating and can only result in further tragedies. JOSEPH GERSON WATERTOWN, MASS. The writer is vice president of the International Peace Bureau. \u2666 To the Editor: Gordon Chang, in his review, questions the objectivity of Michael Green. His main exhibit in support of this serious charge is that Green\u2019s book does not take into account China\u2019s aggressive conduct when its pilot tipped the wing of an American spy plane, forcing it to land in China. Chang accepts the official American account of what happened. Others suggest that the Chinese pilot inadvertently hit the American plane, though he was clearly buzzing it. In any case, it was one incident, not repeated, despite the fact that the United States conducts many thousands of such legal but provocative surveillance flights up and down the Chinese coast. Chang dismisses the fact that the Bush administration apologized for the incident and offered compensation. The Bush administration rarely accepted blame for whatever went wrong overseas. The fact that it did so in this case speaks volumes. More generally, China\u2019s acts, which are often labeled aggressive (e.g. island building), do not meet the United Nations definition of aggression. And the only person who was killed \u2014 during all these acts \u2014 was the Chinese pilot! One wishes many more nations would not be more aggressive. AMITAI ETZIONIWASHINGTON The writer\u2019s most recent book is \u201cAvoiding War With China.\u201d \u2666 To the Editor: I read with interest Sandra Tsing Loh\u2019s review of \u201cDrop the Ball\u201d and \u201cThe Unmade Bed\u201d (April 2). Both books address the issue of how to manage the pesky tasks of household maintenance. The observation that women, as they achieve financial independence, \u201cfetishize nostalgic and unnecessary domestic arts like knitting and making candles\u201d is misguided and insulting. Perhaps these women are interested in being creative in a manner that produces something beautiful, lasting and useful. Perhaps they are also learning to relax. As a lifelong knitter (but not candlemaker), I take exception to that characterization. And so do those enjoying my knitted scarves, sweaters, donated baby hats and knitted charity projects. DOREEN HURLEY PITTSBURGH \u2666 To the Editor: Your review of \u201cNo One Cares About Crazy People\u201d (April 9) gives some insight into the pain of dealing with mental health challenges. But I would point out that the author\u2019s sons were not their illness \u2014 i.e., they were not \u201cschizophrenics\u201d but lived with schizophrenia. As someone with bipolar disorder, I\u2019m more than my illness. ANNE WEIHER BOULDER, COLO. The Book Review wants to hear from readers.
