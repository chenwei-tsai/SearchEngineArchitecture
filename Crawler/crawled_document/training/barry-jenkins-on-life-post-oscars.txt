{"text": "Barry Jenkins has had some year. His second feature film, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d won the Academy Award for Best Picture in a moment of live television that no one is likely to forget soon (the award was mistakenly handed to \u201cLa La Land\u201d). Not long after that strange, exhilarating, unprecedented night, Jenkins\u2019s next project was announced: an adaptation, for Amazon, of Colson Whitehead\u2019s novel \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d which just won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Because of the confusion onstage at the Oscars, we never got to hear the speech that Jenkins had planned to give. We wanted to ask him about that, and about what it meant to him to make a movie about poor, black, gay southern people that was also rivetingly quiet and stylistically risky. Jenkins dropped by the studio this week. He told us about his directing style, his plans for \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d his love of science fiction, and, yes, that bat-scat crazy night at the Academy Awards. He\u2019s a voluble, thoughtful, warm, funny, movingly humble guy. You might be able to believe he has an Oscar. But he can\u2019t. Not quite yet.
