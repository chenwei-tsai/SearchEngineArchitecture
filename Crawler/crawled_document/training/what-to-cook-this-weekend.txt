That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. The plan is to cook big this weekend, though Frost is in the forecast: Well, I\u2019m no poet. I\u2019m still deciding. Left or right? Is this the weekend to jump feet-first into Samin Nosrat\u2019s epic new \u201cHow to Make Pasta\u201d guide, and make tortellini or farfalle, lasagna or cannelloni? I\u2019d love to make her recipe for ravioli verdi with butter, Parmesan and black pepper tomorrow. Likewise, it\u2019d be fun to make her recipe for whole-wheat fettuccine with spicy broccoli rabe. That\u2019d be a nice Sunday night meal. And it\u2019s been a while since I last knocked out my home version of the beef-cheek ravioli served at the restaurant Babbo in New York, made with braised brisket in place of the cheeks. Faux Babbo ravioli, I called the recipe. \u201cIf it works,\u201d the chef Mario Batali told me when I did, \u201cit is true.\u201d And it works: oh, man. So you could do that. We both could. Making homemade pasta is a fun and worthwhile weekend challenge. But you know what? Julia Moskin picked up an astonishingly delicious-looking recipe from the hard-guy Boston chef Barbara Lynch this week, for roast chicken in a butter-crust pie suit. That road looks less traveled. You make a pie crust. Then you stuff a chicken with vegetables. Then you wrap the chicken tight in the crust and paint it with egg white and bake the package at 400 for an hour and a half. Each person gets some meat, some stuffing, some pie crust. (Discard the skin.) From Julia\u2019s telling, you\u2019ll sing loud about that, no doubt. Make one of them, anyway. (Make both and document it, I\u2019ll interview you for this space: Reach out to foodeditor@nytimes.com.) Or make neither. Cook asparagus instead. Barbecue some baby back ribs. Steam some clams. Make David Tanis\u2019s recipe for cannellini bean salad with shaved spring vegetables. And, if you still want a project, just not the two I\u2019ve outlined, try Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s recipe for a celebration cake. It\u2019s crazy delicious. Many, many more recipes to cook this weekend are available on Cooking. Go take a look at them (search \u201cquail\u201d for fun, or \u201cfreekeh\u201d) and save recipes of interest to your recipe box, so you can find them later when you set to cooking. Put five stars on the recipes you love, and please leave notes on those that you\u2019ve changed for the better, or paired with something interesting. Notes are helpful to one and all. Finally, if you run into a jam with the technology, or with your kitchen work, please write for help. We reside at cookingcare@nytimes.com. We\u2019ll get back to you. Now, have you read the comments on Tejal Rao\u2019s story about Kabir Ahmed, a hardworking halal-cart vendor in New York City? They\u2019re heartwarming. One reader even set up a GoFundMe page to send the guy and his family on vacation! Then, watch the trailer for the third and final season of \u201cBloodline\u201d on Netflix, which will perhaps see the Rayburns get their comeuppance or release. And check out this article in Popular Mechanics about the bleeding of horseshoe crabs for medical use, a subject I thought I knew something about until I read the piece. It\u2019s an eye-opener. (A tip of the hat to Longreads for finding it.)
