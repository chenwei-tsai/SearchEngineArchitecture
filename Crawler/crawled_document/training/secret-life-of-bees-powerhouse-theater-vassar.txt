The program at Vassar, now in its 33rd year, has been a formidable breeding ground for new works before they arrive in New York City. \u201cHamilton\u201d and \u201cThe Humans\u201d were developed there, and last year, Sarah DeLappe\u2019s \u201cThe Wolves\u201d and Taylor Mac\u2019s \u201cA 24-Decade History of Popular Music\u201d were performed before moving to New York and becoming Pulitzer Prize finalists. Next up is a musical adaptation of \u201cThe Secret Life of Bees,\u201d which was first a novel by Sue Monk Kidd, and then a 2008 film starring Queen Latifah and Dakota Fanning. The play, which follows a troubled teenager in South Carolina, will be workshopped on June 27-29 by a high-powered team: Lynn Nottage (a two-time Pulitzer winner for \u201cRuined\u201d and \u201cSweat\u201d) will write the book; Duncan Sheik (a Tony and Grammy winner for \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d) the music; and Susan Birkenhead the lyrics. Sam Gold (\u201cFun Home\u201d) will direct. Lisa Kron, a collaborator with Mr. Gold on \u201cFun Home,\u201d is writing the lyrics to \u201cStilyagi,\u201d which is based on a Russian musical film and receiving a workshop on June 23-25. Stephen Trask and Peter Yanowitz, who both worked on \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch,\u201d are writing the music and lyrics for \u201cThis Ain\u2019t No Disco,\u201d which is set in New York City nightclubs in 1979 and will run June 30-July 2. Two plays are being staged in full. \u201cSacred Valley,\u201d written by Josh Radnor of \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d will run June 29-July 9; this bittersweet comedy, which in part concerns hallucinogens, received a reading at Vassar last year. And Kevin Armento\u2019s \u201cGood Men Wanted,\u201d which follows women fighting in the Civil War, will run July 20-30. A full lineup can be found at powerhouse.vassar.edu."}
