{"source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-17T22:00:13-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "text": "TUESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 If you were to look up the definition of the word \u201cpersisting\u201d in the dictionary, you would find the following: \u201cto go on resolutely or stubbornly in spite of opposition, importunity, or warning.\u201d Bruce Haight has a lesson for us today, even though it has nothing at all to do with his theme. You can read more about how today\u2019s puzzle came to be in his notes below, but I will say this: Mr. Haight is a persistent man. When he gets an idea in his head, he goes ahead with it, despite advice to the contrary. The thing is, today\u2019s puzzle is a classic example of borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. When you set tight constraints in one aspect of a puzzle \u2014 like only using seven letters in the entire puzzle, even if they are commonly used \u2014 you will pay for it in other areas, like the quality of the fill. Because there are only so many words that use those letters, and not all of them are fun to write into a grid. The bottom line here is that it works, but I found Mr. Haight\u2019s puzzle to be more difficult than an average Tuesday, mostly because the theme limits at least some of the fill to entries that are not necessarily early week fare. But I will say this: No one ever discovered anything new by not trying. So kudos to Mr. Haight for his persistence. And kudos to our editors for being \u201cpractical sorts,\u201d who patiently provide guidance to constructors who want to make an idea work, come hell or high water. To answer the question that you are most likely asking yourself about why the editors might run a puzzle that they initially rejected, there are two reasons: The first is that Mr. Haight worked diligently with them to improve his original idea. Second, the analogy I think of is that the puzzles are like art in a museum: curators might not love every piece they display, but it\u2019s their job to put the art out there anyway to let each piece speak for itself and to give viewers a chance to decide for themselves. We typically see the puzzle revealer in the center or at the bottom of a grid, but today, Mr. Haight places his toward the top, at 20A. The clue is \u201cPractical sort ... or anagram #1 of the only seven letters used to make this puzzle,\u201d and the answer here is REALIST. That\u2019s gives you two valuable hints: There are a total of four anagrams in this theme, and solving has been made easier by including \u201c ... or anagram #X\u201d in those clues. \u25a0 18A: I had ASSA_ and had to run the alphabet to get ASSAI (I still didn\u2019t have SISSIES at 15D), but it does indeed mean \u201cvery\u201d in Italian musical terms. You are most likely to see it in \u201cscreamo\u201d sheet music, where the common musical notation \u201cstrillare ASSAI\u201d exists. [I can\u2019t say I disagree with her here. \u2014 Ed.]  \u25a0 45A: See how the black squares make the shape of an ELL there? \u25a0 10D: If you get to know one body of water for the purposes of solving crosswords, the ARAL is probably the most useful. It has been in The New York Times\u2019s Crossword more than 500 times.
