{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "Jonathan Demme, the Academy Award-winning filmmaker who died on Wednesday at 73, easily jumped genres in his work, from cerebral thrillers like \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d to scrappy family dramas like \u201cRachel Getting Married.\u201d But music \u2014 especially rock \u2014 remained a through line in his films for decades, inspiring and elevating what ended up onscreen. \u201cIt can be like something that saves you in a scene that isn\u2019t working that great \u2014 the right music can make a weak scene acceptable,\u201d Mr. Demme once said. \u201cIt can also add a whole other dimension to a scene. It can send it right into the ozone.\u201d Or it can be the main event, as seen in his assortment of music videos and concert films. \u201cI have always been a fanatical rock \u2019n\u2019 roller, and I\u2019ve always been interested in the musical aspect of the films I\u2019ve made,\u201d the director said. Never far from the surface, those facets will remain a key part of Mr. Demme\u2019s legacy; below is a selection of some of his standout moments in song. Mr. Demme\u2019s self-proclaimed favorite band since 1978, Talking Heads were also his muse for what would become one of the most acclaimed concert films of all time. \u201cStop Making Sense\u201d was shot over three nights at the Pantages Theater in Hollywood on the heels of the band\u2019s 1983 tour supporting the album \u201cSpeaking in Tongues.\u201d \u201cIt was an incredibly cinematic show, so I argued that making a movie was a way to see the show at its maximum advantage,\u201d Mr. Demme said, explaining that he hoped \u201cto try to create a roving \u2018best-seat-in-the-house\u2019 \u2014 as if you were watching from the audience but could have any vantage point you wanted, on the basis of what the most exciting thing happening at that moment was.\u201d His use of lightning and shadows helped to frame the band in ways that would become integral to its iconography. The film critic Pauline Kael called the film \u201ca continuous rock experience that keeps building, becoming ever more intense and euphoric\u201d and \u201cclose to perfection.\u201d The 1988 video for \u201cAway,\u201d by the New Jersey rock band the Feelies, features the group performing at Maxwell\u2019s, the storied Hoboken venue most associated with the group\u2019s \u201980s scene. Simple and effective, the real highlight is the inspired dance moves (and outfits) in the crowd shots. Mr. Demme said he hoped to make an entire film about the Feelies \u2014 calling it a mix between \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and \u201cThe Last Waltz\u201d \u2014 but had trouble scrounging up the funds. Two years before \u201cAway,\u201d the Feelies had a cameo as the Willies, a band at a high school reunion, in \u201cSomething Wild,\u201d starring Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith. The film is a musical buffet, featuring some 49 songs, but a cover of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cFame\u201d \u2014 providing a score to Mr. Daniels\u2019s character as he gets progressively looser and even attempts a (below average) moonwalk \u2014 stands out. The group also covered \u201cI\u2019m a Believer\u201d by the Monkees and worked in bits of its own work including \u201cCrazy Rhythms.\u201d Loyal with his musical favorites, Mr. Demme consistently popped New Order songs into his oeuvre, including \u201cSomething Wild\u201d and \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d from 1988. A few years earlier, the director created the nearly 11-minute video for \u201cThe Perfect Kiss,\u201d a single from the band\u2019s 1985 album, \u201cLow-Life.\u201d Shot in New Order\u2019s practice studio, the video is heavy on close-ups, as a poster for Joy Division\u2019s \u201cUnknown Pleasures\u201d looms in the background. \u201cOne of my favorite things in watching any performance on film is when there isn\u2019t a lot of cutting going on and when you get a chance to become really absorbed in the artist in hand,\u201d the director told The Guardian in 1998. \u201cThe same way we do, hopefully, at a concert, when we get a chance to really trip in to something that\u2019s happening onstage.\u201d The director of four Neil Young projects \u2014 \u201cThe Complex Sessions,\u201d a short film with Crazy Horse; \u201cNeil Young: Heart of Gold\u201d (2006); \u201cNeil Young Trunk Show\u201d (2009); and \u201cNeil Young Journeys\u201d (2012) \u2014 Mr. Demme recalled the singer-songwriter and guitarist \u201chitting me very hard\u201d in the 1960s. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t an acquired taste,\u201d Mr. Demme told Rolling Stone in 2012. \u201cI loved him immediately.\u201d The director, who often mixed concert footage with documentary material, said he felt that \u201cshooting live music is the most purely cinematic thing you can do\u201d He added: \u201cIdeally, the cinema is becoming one with the music. There is little artifice involved.\u201d In line with his Neil Young fixation, Mr. Demme originally planned to open \u201cPhiladelphia,\u201d his 1993 film starring Tom Hanks as a gay lawyer dying of complications from AIDS, with \u201cSouthern Man,\u201d a rock song that could speak to potentially homophobic straight guys. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to preach to the choir with this thing,\u201d the director said. \u201cI wanted to reassure the guys that Neil thinks this is O.K.\u201d But after some back-and-forth with the singer, they decided to use a new song (\u201cPhiladelphia\u201d) to close the film instead, leaving the opening sequence, a montage of the city, to be scored by Bruce Springsteen\u2019s somber \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d That track would go on to win Mr. Springsteen an Academy Award for best original song. For many, the indelible shot from \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d (1991) is of the serial killer Buffalo Bill making himself up and dancing naked for a videocamera while his desperate captive attempts an escape. The song putting him in the mood \u2014 \u201cGoodbye Horses\u201d by the otherwise obscure \u201980s singer Q Lazzarus \u2014 adds an extra layer of eeriness to the scene, as Bill\u2019s singalong overpowers the cries of his victim. Mr. Demme first heard the song, which was not in the script, in a New York taxi during a blizzard. The driver was Q Lazzarus. Opening with another Springsteen number and ending on Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers\u2019 \u201cAmerican Girl\u201d (albeit cover versions), \u201cRicki and the Flash\u201d (2015) was a late-career love letter to rock music from a director that couldn\u2019t help being inspired by song. Meryl Streep starred as an aging singer, and the actress recorded live takes of the movie\u2019s music for an authentic touch. \u201cWe\u2019re not sweetening it up on the soundtrack,\u201d Mr. Demme said. \u201cIt\u2019s performance! I have to say, with our band \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t say it, but I want to say what I feel in my heart \u2014 Ricki and the Flash blow away every original.\u201d", "title": "Jonathan Demme\u2019s Finest Musical Moments", "abstract": "The director, who died on Wednesday at 73, was a self-described \u201cfanatical rock \u2019n\u2019 roller,\u201d who worked with New Order, Talking Heads, Neil Young and others.", "section": "Arts", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-26T14:56:17-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/music/jonathan-demme-music-moments.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T14:56:17-04:00"}
