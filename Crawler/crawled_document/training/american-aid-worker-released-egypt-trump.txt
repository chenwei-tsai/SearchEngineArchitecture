Ms. Hijazi\u2019s case had become an international symbol of Egypt\u2019s treatment of aid workers, and President Trump had been criticized by human rights advocates for not publicly raising her plight during an Oval Office meeting with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt early this month. But the two administration officials said that despite the public silence, the United States had quietly secured a promise by Egyptian officials for her release before Mr. Sisi arrived at the White House, efforts that culminated over the weekend when a court cleared her. Ms. Hijazi, who grew up in Virginia, near Washington, returned aboard a government jet that landed at Joint Base Andrews, accompanied by her family and top American officials. In a statement, lawyers for Ms. Hijazi said that they had \u201cworked closely with the Trump administration to ensure Aya\u2019s case was prioritized at the highest levels, and we are deeply grateful to President Trump for his personal engagement in resolving Aya\u2019s case.\u201d Ms. Hijazi, who has dual Egyptian and American citizenship and is a graduate of George Mason University in Virginia, was arrested in May 2014, along with her husband, Mohamed Hassanein. At the time, she worked at the Beladi Foundation, a nonprofit that she founded to care for street children in Cairo. Egyptian officials had charged Ms. Hijazi and her husband with human trafficking and abusing children, and they faced years in prison. Human rights advocates had called the case \u201cbizarre\u201d and said that it lacked credibility. The case had become a symbol of Mr. Sisi\u2019s authoritarian rule in Egypt since he took power in 2013. His government has increasingly sought to control all forms of dissent, and Ms. Hijazi was labeled an agitator by Egyptian authorities. White House officials said Mr. Trump took a personal interest in her case. He had been briefed about it in the days leading up to Mr. Sisi\u2019s visit, and he instructed his aides to meet with Egyptian officials to lobby for her release. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Let\u2019s bring her home,\u2019\u201d said an American official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters. United States officials met with the visiting Egyptian delegation when it arrived in Washington before Mr. Sisi\u2019s visit, and made clear that the president was focused on her fate and wanted her freed. After long discussions, the Egyptian officials assured the Americans before the White House visit that they would oblige and free her, but not until her court date after Mr. Sisi returned home, the official said. While White House officials felt confident that she was on the verge of freedom, they chose to take what they knew would be criticism in the news media and from political critics for not publicly mentioning her case during Mr. Sisi\u2019s visit. Aides viewed the case as a vindication of Mr. Trump\u2019s stated preference for addressing human rights issues in private. After the Egyptian court ordered Ms. Hijazi\u2019s release, Mr. Trump sent a military aircraft to Cairo to bring her and her family back to Washington. Dina Powell, the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser, who is Egyptian-American and was already in the Middle East traveling with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, met up with the family in Cairo and escorted her home late Thursday night. Ms. Hijazi is scheduled to visit the White House on Friday to see Mr. Trump. The details of her return \u2014 and the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to free her \u2014 were first reported by The Washington Post. Former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration had pressed, unsuccessfully, for Ms. Hijazi\u2019s release since her detention three years ago. Her family had complained at times of a lack of action by Obama administration officials. During Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure, Mr. Sisi had been barred from the White House, reflecting the government\u2019s feelings about his seizure of power in a military takeover. But Mr. Trump has shifted Washington\u2019s approach toward the Egyptian government. In his Oval Office meeting with Mr. Sisi, he lavished praise on the Egyptian leader. \u201cWe agree on so many things,\u201d Mr. Trump said on April 3. \u201cI just want to let everybody know, in case there was any doubt, that we are very much behind President el-Sisi. He\u2019s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. We are very much behind Egypt and the people of Egypt. The United States has, believe me, backing, and we have strong backing.\u201d The decision to reset relations with Egypt and Mr. Sisi appears to have helped shift the direction of Ms. Hijazi\u2019s case. A court in Cairo dropped all charges against her and other defendants in the case on Sunday. Kerry Kennedy, the president of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights center, which represented Ms. Hijazi, said in a statement Thursday night that it was a \u201cday of celebration\u201d for her and the others freed. \u201cTheir strength through adversity serves as a model for all who seek to make our world just and peaceful,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said. \u201cAya and Mohamed stood up for ideals, acted to improve the lot of others and sent forth ripples of hope. We are grateful for their example, and to all those who helped make today possible.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T00:24:49-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/us/politics/american-aid-worker-released-egypt-trump.html", "item_type": "Article"}
