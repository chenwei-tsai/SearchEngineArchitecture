He once went to Greece to help police officers deal with the flood of migrants who had crossed the Aegean Sea and were seeking shelter in the European Union. He was in the crowd at the Bataclan when Sting helped reopen the Paris concert hall in November, one year after concertgoers were gunned down in a terrorist attack. Xavier Jugel\u00e9, 37, a Paris police officer since 2010, himself fell victim to terrorism on Thursday evening. He was in a police vehicle on the heavily guarded Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Paris\u2019s most famous boulevard, when a gunman opened fire, killing him and wounding two other officers, along with a bystander. The gunman was shot dead as he tried to flee; the Islamic State terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack a short while later. Officer Jugel\u00e9 was mourned on Friday by friends and fellow officers. \u201cHe was a simple man who loved his job, and he was really committed to the L.G.B.T. cause,\u201d said Mika\u00ebl Bucheron, president of Flag, a French association for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender police officers. \u201cHe joined the association a few years ago, and he protested with us when there was the homosexual propaganda ban at the Sochi Olympic games,\u201d Mr. Bucheron said. Officer Jugel\u00e9 was born in 1970 in Bourges and grew up in Romorantin-Lanthenay in central France. His father had served in the armed forces. The son was in a civil union. He and his partner did not have children. Before 2010, Officer Jugel\u00e9 was part of the Gendarmerie, one of the two national police forces. He recently had farewell drinks with colleagues because he was set to leave the Paris force and join the Judicial Police, an agency that pursues suspects and serves search warrants, among other functions. \u201cHe was aware of the risks of the job and the terrorist threat, although we did not speak a lot about it,\u201d Mr. Bucheron said. \u201cHe was a great man and friend, it is a big shock for us.\u201d Flag also issued news releases on Facebook and Twitter. Yves Lefebvre, general secretary of the police union Unit\u00e9 S.G.P. Police-Force Ouvri\u00e8re, said that Mr. Jugel\u00e9 had been known for his professionalism and as \u201can excellent colleague.\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, speaking from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Thursday evening, said that an official tribute would be paid to Officer Jugel\u00e9 in the coming days. Matthias Fekl, the French interior minister, visited the hospital where the two wounded policemen were being treated, and expressed his support on Twitter for relatives of the officers. France has been under a state of emergency since the attacks of November 2015 in and around Paris. Police and security officers have been especially concerned after a string of attacks targeting law enforcement: \u2022 Three police officers \u2014 Franck Brinsolaro, Clarissa Jean-Phillipe and Ahmed Merabet \u2014 were killed in attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, on a Jewish grocery, and in a Paris suburb in 2015. \u2022 A year later, police officers fatally shot a man who was wielding a cleaver and yelling \u201cGod is great\u201d as he tried to attack a police station in northern Paris. \u2022 In June 2016, a Paris police captain, Jean-Baptiste Salvaing, was fatally stabbed at his home, along with his longtime partner, Jessica Schneider, a civil servant, who was killed as the couple\u2019s 3-year-old son watched. The attack took place in the suburb of Magnanville and was claimed by the Islamic State. \u2022 In February, a man armed with two large knives and shouting \u201cGod is great\u201d lunged at a military patrol near an entrance to the Louvre. He was shot. \u2022 In March, a gunman was shot dead by a military patrol at the Orly airport, south of Paris, after he attacked a soldier, prompting a partial evacuation of the airport. In response to the attack in Magnanville, France eased gun restrictions to allow off-duty police officers to carry their sidearms, even when the nation is not under a state of emergency. The 10,000 soldiers who have been deployed across France since January 2015 to secure crowded or sensitive areas have also been targeted over the past few years, often by lone assailants who were inspired by radical Islamist propaganda but had no connections to wider networks.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T09:59:41-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/europe/xavier-jugele-police-attack-champs-elysees.html", "item_type": "Article"}
