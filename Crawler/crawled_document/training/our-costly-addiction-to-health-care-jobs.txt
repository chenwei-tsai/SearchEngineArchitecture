{"abstract": "Can President Trump create jobs and also reduce health care spending? Probably not.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "The health care industry has been a great friend to the United States economy. Its plentiful jobs helped lift the country out of the Great Recession, and thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, it now employs one in nine Americans \u2014 up from one in 12 in 2000. As President Trump seeks to fulfill his campaign pledge to create millions more jobs, the industry would seem a promising place to turn. But the billionaire businessman also campaigned to repeal Obamacare and lower health care costs \u2014 a potentially serious job killer. With Mr. Trump renewing his push to replace Obamacare, he faces a dilemma. \u201cThe goal of increasing jobs in health care is incompatible with the goal of keeping health care affordable,\u201d said Katherine Baicker, a Harvard University health economist who sees advantages in trimming the industry\u2019s growth. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence we can get more bang for our buck in health care. We should be aiming for a health care system that operates more efficiently and effectively. That might mean better outcomes for patients and fewer jobs.\u201d But the country has grown increasingly dependent on the health sector to power the economy, and it will be a tough habit to break. Thirty-five percent of the nation\u2019s job growth has come from health care since the recession hit in late 2007, the single biggest sector for job creation. Hiring rose even more as coverage expanded in 2014 under the health care law and new federal dollars flowed in. The law gave hospitals, universities and companies even more reason to invest in new facilities and staff. Training programs sprang up to fill the growing job pool. Cities welcomed the development \u2014 and the revenue. Simply put, rising health spending has been good for some economically distressed parts of the country, many of which voted for Mr. Trump last year. The West Virginia University health system, for example, recently opened a 10-story medical tower in Morgantown and hired more than 2,000 employees last year. In Danville, Pa., the Geisinger Health System has added some 2,200 workers since July, and it\u2019s trying to fill 2,000 more jobs across its 12 hospital campuses and insurance company. Out west, UCHealth in Colorado expanded its Fort Collins hospital and is building three new hospitals in the state. In cities such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland and St. Louis, health care has replaced dying industries like coal mining and heavy manufacturing as a primary source of jobs. \u201cThe industry accounts for a lot of good middle-class jobs and, in many communities, it\u2019s the single-largest employer,\u201d said Sam Glick, a partner in the San Francisco office of Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. \u201cOne of the hardest decisions for the new Trump administration is how far do they push on health care costs at the expense of jobs in health care.\u201d House Republicans, with backing from Mr. Trump, took the first swipe. Their American Health Care Act sought to roll back the current health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion and cut federal subsidies for private health insurance. The plan faltered in the House, but Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration say they are again trying to draft a replacement for Obamacare. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the latest Republican bill tackles what some industry experts and economists see as a serious underlying reason for high health care costs: a system bloated by redundancy, inefficiency and a growing number of jobs far removed from patient care. Labor accounts for more than half of the $3.4 trillion spent on American health care, and medical professionals like health aides and nurse practitioners are in high demand. But the sheer complexity of the system has also spawned jobs for legions of data-entry clerks, revenue-cycle analysts and medical billing coders who must decipher arcane rules to mine money from human ills. For every doctor, there are 16 other health care workers. And half of those 16 are in administrative and other nonclinical roles, according to Bob Kocher, a former Obama administration official who worked on the Affordable Care Act and is now a partner in the venture capital firm Venrock. \u201cI find super-expensive drugs annoying, and hospital market power is a big problem,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cBut what\u2019s driving our health insurance premiums is that we are paying the wages of a whole bunch of people who aren\u2019t involved in the delivery of care. Hospitals keep raising their rates to pay for all of this labor.\u201d Take medical coders. Membership in the American Academy of Professional Coders has swelled to more than 165,000, up 10,000 in the past year alone. The average salary has risen to nearly $50,000, offering a path to the American dream. \u201cThe coding profession is a great opportunity for individuals seeking their first job, and it\u2019s attractive to a lot of medical professionals burned out on patient care,\u201d said Raemarie Jimenez, a vice president at the medical coding group. \u201cThere is a lot of opportunity once you\u2019ve got a foot in the door.\u201d Some of these back-office workers wage battle every day in clinics and hospitals against an army of claims administrators filling up cubicles inside insurance companies. Overseeing it all are hundreds of corporate vice presidents drawing six-figure salaries. Administrative costs for the American health care system are the highest in the developed world, according to a January report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. More than 8 percent of domestic health spending is tied up in administration, while the average globally is about 3 percent. America spent $631 for every man, woman and child on health insurance administration for 2012, compared with $54 in Japan. America\u2019s huge investment in health care and related jobs hasn\u2019t always led to better results for patients, data show. But it has provided good-paying jobs, which is why the talk of deep cuts in federal health spending has many people concerned. Linda Gonzalez, a 31-year-old mother of two, was among the thousands of enrollment counselors hired to help sign up Americans for health insurance as Obamacare rolled out in 2014. Ms. Gonzalez, a college graduate, makes more than $40,000 a year working at an AltaMed enrollment center, tucked between a Verizon Wireless store and a nail salon on a busy street in Los Angeles. In her cramped cubicle, families pull up chairs and sort through pay stubs and tax returns, often relying on her to sort out enrollment glitches with Medicaid. As the sole breadwinner for her two children, ages 9 and 10, she counts on this job but isn\u2019t sure how long it will last. \u201cA lot of people depend on this,\u201d she said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s something I do worry about.\u201d", "section": "Opinion", "title": "Our Costly Addiction to Health Care Jobs", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/opinion/sunday/our-costly-addiction-to-health-care-jobs.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T14:30:17-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T14:30:17-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News Analysis", "item_type": "Article"}
