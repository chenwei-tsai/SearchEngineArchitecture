Mr. Gallego, 91, also recently switched dwellings, moving from the nearby home of some relatives to the more spartan surroundings of his self-made temple. He wants to make certain he will die in the place that has become his life\u2019s mission. \u201cThis is where my vocation has taken me and this is where I\u2019m prepared to suffer, just as Jesus Christ taught us to suffer for others,\u201d said Mr. Gallego, as he threw wood onto a stove by his rudimentary bedroom, next to the altar, where he sleeps on a plank without a mattress. Mr. Gallego might be ready to confront death, but some residents here worry about what will happen to his extraordinary project without him. Mr. Gallego has never received a building permit or any public financing, but he has managed to erect a striking landmark in this otherwise nondescript town of 23,000 inhabitants on the outskirts of Madrid. His ambitious undertaking is labeled the \u201cCathedral of Faith\u201d on internet maps, even though it has received no official backing from officials of the Catholic Church. Flanked by two cloisters and crowned by an unfinished 125-foot-tall cupola, it attracts tourists on the weekend, helping lift the local economy. \u201cThis man has built something incredible against all odds and turned it into a symbol of our town,\u201d said Victor Morillo, a resident who can see the cupola from the balcony of his apartment. \u201cThe Town Hall should have done a lot more to help and should certainly not allow anything bad to happen to this cathedral after he dies.\u201d Mr. Gallego, however, is unmoved by this kind of support, just as he has been unshaken by past criticism of his project and his own personality, sometimes derided as that of an exalted former monk. He is also unfazed that he has never received any public financing, even in a country that is mostly Catholic and whose infrastructure has been heavily subsidized. \u201cI\u2019ve not been building this to get money or fame, just as I\u2019m not here to listen to people decide whether I\u2019m mad or unique,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fully responsible for my work and I\u2019m not looking for the authorities to have any say.\u201d Despite the lack of permits, no one is talking of tearing the church down, but neither is anyone certain of the project\u2019s long-term future. Encarnaci\u00f3n Mart\u00edn \u00c1lvarez, an official in charge of urban planning here, said the city could not finance Mr. Gallego because of budgetary constraints and had made no plan to guarantee the continuation of the project, whatever its growing importance to the town and its identity. Mr. Gallego was born here in 1925, on the day of the town\u2019s patron saint, the Virgin of Sorrows. At 27, he joined a monastery in the northern province of Soria, but was ordered to leave eight years later, after he caught tuberculosis and risked contaminating the other monks. After recovering in a Madrid hospital, Mr. Gallego returned to his hometown, where he decided to turn a family plot of land into a place of worship, without the blessing of the Catholic Church. He said that his project was an act of faith, motivated in part by his desire to make amends for the desecration he witnessed during the Spanish Civil War. During the war, \u201cI saw the Communists destroy all the churches here, with people laughing and dancing in the ruins,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you believe, you can then also rebuild with your own hands a beautiful new place.\u201d Indeed, Mr. Gallego has put up most of the church himself, without any training as an architect or civil engineer, using recycled material ranging from food tins to misshapen bricks and other leftovers from local factories and construction sites. The capitals of some of the church\u2019s concrete pillars are made from secondhand car tires, painted gray to resemble the color of the concrete used for the pillar. Part of the roofing is still missing, but there are already frescoes on the walls. Mr. Gallego has financed his work by selling family farmland, as well as through donations. He has held religious ceremonies on the premises, but the ground has not been consecrated. \u201cMany members of the institutional church view him as a fanatic who shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously, but I consider him an example for humanity,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Teresa Alonso, a retiree from a nearby town, who visits occasionally and has donated money to help Mr. Gallego. \u201cThey say faith can move mountains, but here we see that faith can also build an incredible cathedral.\u201d Mr. Gallego has received some informal support from members of the local clergy. \u201cThere have been complaints about him, but we support him in as far as we can,\u201d said Pedro Luis Jim\u00e9nez Langa, a parish priest in town. \u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional work, and he\u2019s a good man.\u201d With his health growing more fragile, Mr. Gallego has increasingly relied on friends and volunteers to help with construction. A local entrepreneur offered a crane to lift the cupola, while some admirers have donated religious sculptures and decorations, rather than money. But nothing gets added without Mr. Gallego\u2019s approval, particularly if it jars with the arches and other circular designs that he loves, which are loosely based on the Romanesque style. \u201cThat\u2019s really not going to look good anywhere around here,\u201d Mr. Gallego said, as he studied a blue dove made of raffia given as a donation, but which Mr. Gallego left lying on the floor. While some have wondered about Mr. Gallego\u2019s mental health, his supporters dispute there\u2019s anything unhealthy about his obsession. \u201cDo you really think somebody mad could have built something like this?\u201d said Pablo Cantuel Gallego, a nephew, 64, who has been helping his uncle since he was a child. \u201cThe only problem with my uncle is that he belongs to a different century. He thinks and works like nobody could now imagine doing.\u201d It is notable that Mr. Gallego\u2019s building is on a street named after Antoni Gaud\u00ed, the architect of Barcelona\u2019s world-famous and unfinished basilica, the Sagrada Famil\u00eda. Gaud\u00ed died in 1926, but other architects have taken over and hope to finish his basilica in 2026, for the centenary of his death. Mr. Gallego, on the other hand, has no timetable and not even a single sketch of his cathedral project. But he does have one trusted assistant, \u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez, who said that he would take over the works when Mr. Gallego died. \u201cThe only plan is made in my head, drawn day by day,\u201d Mr. Gallego said, with a grin that revealed several missing teeth. \u201cBut Jesus Christ is the one who makes the real plans and decides what eventually should happen.\u201d"}
