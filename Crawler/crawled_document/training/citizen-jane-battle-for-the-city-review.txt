{"updated_date": "2017-04-19T12:20:23-04:00", "text": "Because New York City is so ecumenically photogenic, I had high hopes for this documentary about two visionaries with diametrically opposed views of how the city and its residents best live. \u201cCitizen Jane: Battle for the City,\u201d directed by Matt Tyrnauer, which chronicles the author and activist Jane Jacobs\u2019s opposition to several ambitious, potentially ruinous Robert Moses projects, is only intermittently stimulating. The film does not cite the many books that have been written about Moses and Jacobs, but it does quote extensively from Jacobs\u2019s own groundbreaking 1961 volume, \u201cThe Death and Life of Great American Cities.\u201d If you\u2019ve read Robert Caro\u2019s Moses biography, \u201cThe Power Broker,\u201d and Anthony Flint\u2019s account of Jacobs\u2019s activism, \u201cWrestling With Moses,\u201d you know many of the stories eventually retold here. (Mr. Flint is one of the talking heads; Mr. Caro is not.) For the movie\u2019s first half-hour, though, contemporary interviewees repeatedly evoke the views of Moses and Le Corbusier, advocates of a sterile modernism, and contrast them with Jacobs\u2019s advocacy of a more organic mode of urban growth. A long time goes by before any specific project is explored. The movie lights up whenever it shows archival footage of its antagonists: Jacobs is sensible, warm and witty; Moses is cocksure, occasionally truculent, openly contemptuous of the people his big ideas are likely to displace. Defending a project that would have run Fifth Avenue through Washington Square Park, he sneers at the \u201ccabarets and speakeasies\u201d he plans to raze. Also interesting (and too brief) is a section on the international legacy of Moses: \u201cChina today is Moses on steroids,\u201d the political economist Saskia Sassen notes.
