Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said at an event in Washington as the White House planned an afternoon rollout of its principles for what it bills as the first overhaul of the tax code in three decades. \u201cThis bill is about creating economic growth and jobs.\u201d He vowed it would be \u201cthe biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in the history of our country,\u201d in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s grandiose portrayal. But there was no expectation that the White House would elucidate how the deep cuts would be financed, and administration officials are cognizant of the challenges of pushing through a proposal that could dramatically add to the national debt. If, in fact, the proposal cuts taxes but fails to close loopholes or raise some other taxes, it would not be a true reform of the tax code. It would be a tax cut along the lines of President George W. Bush\u2019s tax measure in 2001 and 2003. Nor is it clear that it would be the largest in history. Tax cutters from Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge to John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan vie for that title. Mr. Mnuchin offered few specifics about the blueprint, other than confirming that its centerpiece will be a 15 percent business tax rate, which would apply not only to corporations, but also to small businesses and other large owner-operated conglomerates, such as Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate empire. He also said the White House is not on board with the border-adjustment tax that is central to House Republicans\u2019 tax plan \u201cin its current form,\u201d setting up an intraparty struggle over the elements of the plan and how to offset the deep reductions envisioned. Mr. Trump also wants to increase the standard deduction for individuals, according to people briefed on the plan, an attempt to fulfill his promises to provide tax cuts for middle-income people and simplify the process of filing returns. That proposal is likely to engender strong resistance from home builders and real estate agents, who fear it would diminish the importance of the mortgage interest deduction, as well as other sectors that could see the tax benefits associated with their businesses curbed or eliminated. And Democrats are gearing up for a fight. \u201cTrump\u2019s latest proposal is another gift to corporations and billionaires like himself,\u201d said Tom Perez, the Democratic Party chairman. \u201cTrump must release his tax returns, as millions of Americans are demanding, before Congress can consider any Trump tax plan. We must know how much Trump would personally financially benefit from his own proposal.\u201d The long-awaited White House blueprint is intended to formally begin the push to get a tax overhaul done before the end of the year. Officials have cautioned that the announcement will be light on detail and should not be viewed as the final word in what is likely to be a mammoth negotiation. While Mr. Trump has portrayed the effort as a top priority, he had no plans to appear publicly on Wednesday to roll it out, leaving that task to Mr. Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, who are to brief reporters at the White House in the afternoon. The plan contrasts starkly with one that has been championed by House Republicans, who had proposed paying for their tax cuts in part with the new tax on imports, an effort to ensure that the measure would not swell the deficit. But on Wednesday, many Republicans \u2014 even leading proponents of that plan \u2014 insisted they were in broad agreement with the White House on the contours of a tax rewrite. \u201cI think there\u2019s 80 percent or more common ground here \u2014 we\u2019ve got some work to do,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cI think the president is going bold here.\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said this week that the tax changes would spur the economy to grow by 3 percent, which he said would pay for the vast cuts in federal revenues. But even Republicans privately concede that stronger growth would not entirely offset the cost. Democrats scoffed at the notion on Wednesday. \u201cAmerica is a great nation,\u201d said Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t yet discovered magic.\u201d He called Mr. Trump\u2019s tax proposal \u201cmathematically impossible.\u201d Republicans have long called for comprehensive permanent changes to the tax code, but lately they have shown increasing openness to the possibility of tax cuts with an expiration date. If they embark on a plan to move legislation that adds to the deficit and cannot be filibustered by Democrats, Senate budget rules dictate that the tax cuts would expire after a decade. \u201cThe goal is to make it permanent, but there\u2019s lots of levers here,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIf we have them for 10 years, that\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d Beyond cutting the tax rate to 15 percent for large corporations, which now pay a rate of 35 percent, Mr. Trump also wants that rate for a broad range of firms known as pass-through entities \u2014 including hedge funds, real estate concerns like Mr. Trump\u2019s and large partnerships \u2014 that currently pay taxes at individual rates, which top off at 39.6 percent. Acknowledging concerns that such a move could potentially be used as a tax shelter, Mr. Mnuchin insisted on Wednesday that the administration\u2019s plan would not be used as a loophole to allow people to pay less tax than they should be paying. The concern would be that lawyers, doctors, consultants or other wealthy people in partnerships could structure much of their personal income as business income, effectively reducing their tax rate from 39.6 percent to 15 percent. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a tax plan that allows the very rich to use pass-throughs to reduce their rates to 15 percent while average Americans are paying much more,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not tax reform. That\u2019s just a tax giveaway to the very, very wealthy that will explode the deficit.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T11:44:36-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "abstract": "Steven T.
