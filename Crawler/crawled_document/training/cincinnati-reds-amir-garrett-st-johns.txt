{"abstract": "Amir Garrett, who has made three quality starts for Cincinnati this season, honed his competitiveness playing basketball for St. John\u2019s.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "When Amir Garrett played basketball for St. John\u2019s University, he was the classic prototype: loved by his teammates and loathed by his opponents. \u201cWhat he brought was fire, competitiveness, spirit, toughness, tenacity,\u201d said Steve Lavin, his coach there. \u201cHe did it all-out every time he stepped on the court. He was like a Danny Ainge or an M. L. Carr \u2014 he\u2019d try to get under opponents\u2019 skin. He played with a chip, a hard edge.\u201d Garrett played two seasons for the Red Storm, but he was already a professional baseball player when he arrived on campus. He reached the majors this month as a starting pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds, and has a 1.83 earned run average in three quality starts. Garrett, who will turn 25 next month, works with style, beginning each inning by scratching a large letter A on the mound with his spikes. For the rebuilding Reds, who have made a respectable start to the season, he has been a wise investment. They drafted Garrett in the 22nd round out of a high school near Las Vegas in 2011, gave him a $1 million bonus and let him follow his other passion in the off-seasons. Garrett chose St. John\u2019s. \u201cThat experience, I\u2019d never change it,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIf I could do it all over again, I\u2019d do the same thing. The education I got, becoming a better student, a better person. College taught me how to grow up and be a man. I enjoyed New York and the fans. Everybody in New York was loving, and they accepted me.\u201d Garrett, a 6-foot-5 guard, played 55 games over the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons for St. John\u2019s, averaging 6.2 points and 22.8 minutes per game. He was a valuable contributor at a major college program, impressive for someone who had not played basketball until high school. Garrett tried the sport after he quit baseball following the death of his grandfather Mack Wysinger. \u201cMy grandfather passed away when I was in eighth grade, and he taught me how to play baseball,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cThe thought of it made me miss him more. When I played basketball, it took my mind off it. It was a newfound love.\u201d Encouraged to pitch again by his father, Darryl, Garrett showed enough skill as a senior to earn his professional chance. But he did not turn full time to baseball until the summer of 2014, after he had transferred to California State University, Northridge, and sat out of basketball for a season. He never played for the Matadors because his baseball career bloomed. Garrett made 27 starts for Class A Daytona in 2014, with a 3.65 E.R.A. In eight starts there the year before, his E.R.A. had been 6.88. He could feel himself making progress and did not want to stop. \u201cI turned into a pitcher,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI knew how to hit my spots with any one of my pitches.\u201d Those pitches now include a fastball, a slider and a changeup he throws about 20 percent of the time \u2014 all let loose from an imposing frame. Garrett said his favorite pitcher has always been the Hall of Fame left-hander Randy Johnson, who is 6-10. Johnson might be an impossibly high standard for Garrett, but Lavin said he knew he was destined for baseball success. Dusty Baker, a friend who was then the Reds\u2019 manager, told Lavin that Garrett was not just an ordinary prospect, but the best in Cincinnati\u2019s farm system. \u201cHe was going to be great independent of whether he played Division I basketball or came to St. John\u2019s,\u201d said Lavin, now a broadcaster for the Pac-12 Network. \u201cBut I do think, in the evolution and maturation of his ability as a pitcher, it plays a part.\u201d Bryan Price, the Reds\u2019 manager, has cited Garrett\u2019s competitive streak as a major attribute, and Garrett said he honed it at St. John\u2019s. \u201cPlaying basketball, playing in the Big East, it helped me to be very competitive, to never back down from anybody,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cOn the mound, it taught me how to have that tenacious attitude and relentless will to win.\u201d Garrett has won twice already, and in his one loss, he fanned 12 Baltimore Orioles in seven innings on Wednesday. He has left basketball behind, but is still no fun for opponents. The unmistakable trend in front offices is that top jobs in baseball operations go to graduates of prestigious colleges in the Northeast. Competition is fierce for these positions, and almost invariably, the people who get them are bright, articulate and passionate for their work and often have college playing backgrounds. And they tend to be white men. \u201cA lot of clubs are in the same position: You don\u2019t have to recruit,\u201d said Dan Halem, the chief legal officer for Major League Baseball. \u201cYou just get all these r\u00e9sum\u00e9s flowing into you through different sources, and each one\u2019s better than the next. You end up hiring from that pool, because they\u2019re all extraordinarily qualified. \u201cThe problem is the pool itself may not be diverse. So the key is, in order to find diverse individuals who may have an interest, you actually have to go recruit them.\u201d In the latest report on racial and gender hiring practices in Major League Baseball, the University of Central Florida gave the league an overall grade of C-plus last week. The report, from the school\u2019s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, cited the fact that the league has just three minority managers \u2014 Dusty Baker of the Washington Nationals, Rick Renteria of the Chicago White Sox and Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 and only four minorities with the title of president of baseball operations or general manager: Al Avila of the Detroit Tigers; Michael Hill of the Miami Marlins; Kenny Williams of the White Sox; and Farhan Zaidi of the Dodgers. Baseball\u2019s diversity pipeline program, to identify minority and female job candidates within the game, is in its second year. But one new wrinkle, in time, could be especially significant in finding more diverse candidates for baseball operations jobs. The problem, baseball believes, is not in the colleges that typically funnel young executives to the game. Those colleges tend to have diverse student bodies, and M.L.B. wants to make sure it is finding the qualified candidates within them. To that end, Halem said, M.L.B. is creating a full-time position that will essentially be a scout for front-office talent. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hire a full-time recruiter to go out there to college campuses throughout the United States and try to recruit and sell diverse candidates on working in baseball,\u201d Halem said. \u201cThose who have an interest, we\u2019re going to get their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and kind of a run a job agency, internally, where clubs can have a pool of diverse candidates at the national level they can look at, rather than relying on word of mouth or the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s they get.\u201d As for prospective managerial candidates, Halem said he was encouraged by the growing pool of minority coaches in the game. The U.C.F. report did give baseball an A-plus for diversity in those jobs, with coaches of color at 41 percent in the major leagues and at 45 percent in the minor leagues. \u201cOur coaching numbers are better,\u201d Halem said. \u201cSo hopefully, that\u2019s a positive sign in terms of bench coach and base coaches, which sometimes lead to managerial jobs.\u201d Since the retirements of Derek Jeter, David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez, baseball has lacked superstars who cross over to mainstream pop culture. One who did last week was rather unlikely: pitcher Jose Quintana, who made his first All-Star team last year and who plays for the rebuilding Chicago White Sox. But Quintana appeared Tuesday in a segment on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d teaching Spanish to the host on the plaza outside Rockefeller Center. Quintana, who is from Colombia, was a natural guest star, since he learned English by watching Fallon\u2019s show. \u201cThe show helped me, because his accent is easy for me to catch some words, and I can understand what he says during the shows,\u201d Quintana told reporters at Yankee Stadium after his segment aired. \u201cI used the subtitles, too, and that helped me a lot. It\u2019s funny, because sometimes it can be a little too quick \u2014 sometimes when I watch movies, it can be a little hard to pick something up. But that show, it was easy.\u201d Quintana said he was nervous and excited to be on the show, but Fallon helped calm him down. The White Sox have fielded trade offers for Quintana, but for now they are happy to see him raise his profile. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get outside the box, trying to make sure people see him as a well-rounded individual,\u201d White Sox Manager Rick Renteria said. \u201cHopefully, he\u2019s an example for everyone else, that they can get out there, relax and take advantage of some of the opportunities they\u2019re going to be getting. I thought he did a nice job with it.\u201d", "section": "Sports", "title": "From Red Storm Backcourt to Reds\u2019 Rotation", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/sports/baseball/cincinnati-reds-amir-garrett-st-johns.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T13:03:27-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T12:56:00-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
