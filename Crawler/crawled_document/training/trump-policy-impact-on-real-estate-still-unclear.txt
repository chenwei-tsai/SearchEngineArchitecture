{"text": "The controversial visa-for-sale program called EB-5, which allows foreigners to get green cards by investing in economic development projects, has largely been driven by Chinese applicants in recent years. But interest in the program, which is set to expire on April 28, has spiked in recent months from investors in other countries, mainly because of uncertainty over President Trump\u2019s overall immigration policy. Shortly after Mr. Trump enacted his first travel ban in January, Michael Gibson, a managing director of USAdvisors, which reviews EB-5 proposals for investors, started getting calls from European, Middle Eastern, Turkish and even Canadian clients, including people who\u2019d traveled, worked or studied in the United States for years on nonimmigrant visas and never felt they needed permanent residency. Many of these people had not sought green cards before because of the tax consequences, Mr. Gibson said. But now, \u201cthey\u2019re afraid their visas may be canceled or not renewed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve even got clients from Canada \u2014 Canada, of all places. People who in a million years never would have considered applying for permanent residency are considering it now.\u201d In 2015, more than 80 percent of EB-5 visas went to Chinese investors. Lawyers and consultants who specialize in EB-5 say interest over all in the program has been steady despite the coming expiration date. A three- to six-month straight extension is expected for the program, mainly because it is unlikely that legislators will reach an agreement on proposed reforms, including an effort to increase the required amount invested to $1 million from $500,000, before the expiration date. Though it remains unclear what impact Mr. Trump will ultimately have on foreign investment in the New York City real estate market, what is clear is that foreign investors are carefully parsing his policies and pronouncements. Their conclusions often differ. While uneasiness about broader changes to American immigration policy under Mr. Trump has some foreigners rushing into real estate investments in the United States, other foreigners see the president\u2019s hard-line immigration rhetoric and tumultuous first months in office as reasons to hold off. The uncertainty of election seasons usually make for notoriously slow real estate markets, but Christine Miller Martin, an associate real estate broker at Engel & V\u00f6lkers, said Mr. Trump\u2019s election was \u201cthe first time I\u2019ve ever seen someone making a decision based on who\u2019s president.\u201d She said she had a buyer from Mexico who during the election postponed his search for a Manhattan condo in the $3 million to $5 million range. He told her, \u201c\u2018If Trump wins, I\u2019m not going forward,\u2019\u201d Ms. Martin said, adding that with Mr. Trump in the White House, the client hasn\u2019t entirely written off the possibility of buying in New York, but he isn\u2019t looking, either. The role of foreign investment in New York has become a defining one in recent years, with Manhattan consistently topping the list of American cities attracting foreign investment. Last year, Chinese investors were involved in Manhattan deals totaling $6.5 billion (not including individual apartment sales), followed by Germany at $2.3 billion and Britain at $1.5 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics . Foreigners and foreign-held companies have also been behind many of Manhattan\u2019s biggest deals, like the Chinese insurer Anbang\u2019s $1.95 billion purchase of the Waldorf Astoria in 2015. But while most caution that it is too soon to tell how Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency will affect this influx of capital in the long run, residential brokers say that the overall volume of deals has increased and foreign capital isn\u2019t disappearing. Frederick Peters, chief executive of Warburg Realty, said that so far the residential market has been \u201csomewhat surprisingly, stronger than it was before the election.\u201d He added: \u201cOf course, it\u2019s only been a few months. Realistically speaking, we\u2019re in uncharted territory. We\u2019ve never had a president like this.\u201d Economists point to several factors helping to buoy the real estate market: a strong stock market and many investors salivating over the prospect of deregulation and tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump. Ryan Severino, the chief economist at JLL, a commercial real estate services firm, said that \u201cif investors think they\u2019ll outperform in the U.S., that\u2019s where they\u2019ll go.\u201d At least in the short term, brokers said that their experience has largely conformed to that assessment. Leonard Steinberg, the president of Compass, said that many buyers who had halted their property hunts after the election were now circling back. Investors, he said, \u201ctend to be apolitical.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re more number crunchers than anything else,\u201d he continued. \u201cAmerica goes through cycles, but it always seems to win, and they see it as a long-term investment, not a quick buck.\u201d Numbers for the first quarter of 2017 bear that out. While overall investment across all categories of real estate was down compared with the first quarter of last year, dropping to $4.03 billion from $9.6 billion, and foreign investment in the institutional market fell to $1.63 billion from $2.03 billion, the percentage of foreign versus domestic investment in the market leapt to 40 percent from 21 percent, according to numbers provided by Real Capital Analytics (which do not include individual apartment sales or deals under $2.5 million) . First quarter numbers from residential firms show that overall deal volume is up, though they do not distinguish between domestic and foreign buyers. Gary Barnett, president and founder of Extell Development Company, said that he fully expected that with the anticipation of a significant corporate tax cut driving up the stock market, people will be motivated to invest in real assets, further burnishing New York\u2019s reputation as a safe haven for foreign capital. \u201cFrom a real estate investment perspective, there\u2019s one country that has stability, rule of law, that\u2019s a place you can invest in,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the U.S.\u201d Royce Pinkwater, founder and chief executive of the residential brokerage Pinkwater Select, said while sales this year have been markedly better than last year, she was seeing a lot of confusion in the market. \u201cPeople are stunned and when people are stunned they avoid commitments,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout a doubt Trump has made certain groups of people feel extremely unwelcome.\u201d One of the largest unanswered questions about the Trump presidency is whether Mr. Trump\u2019s business instincts will prevail over the nationalistic, protectionist ideology favored by some of his top advisers and the base that helped propel him into power. Many in the industry, however, said that they were confident New York City real estate was \u201cin Trump\u2019s blood\u201d \u2014 and that he would look out for their interests. A number, for example, expressed certainty that Mr. Trump would prove an ally when it came to EB-5, though the president has yet to offer any statement on the program. Abteen Vaziri, a director at Greystone EB-5, an arm of a real estate advisory firm that connects investors with qualifying projects, said that he thought the program might even expand under Mr. Trump. \u201cThey don\u2019t view EB-5 as an immigration program, they view it as a jobs program, and this administration has said that creating jobs is the No. 1 priority,\u201d he said. At least two Trump-affiliated projects have used EB-5, Trump Bay Street in Jersey City and Austin Mirabeau Trump Hotel in Texas. As much as EB-5 is likely to be preserved and protected, even as other immigration channels are tightened, so too, many speculated, would New York\u2019s real estate market, whose extremely high prices make it distinct from most other American markets. Edward A. Mermelstein, a managing partner in the law firm Rheem Bell & Mermelstein, which works with many high-net-worth foreign buyers, said that while he\u2019s seen Chinese and Middle Eastern clients pull back to wait for more details on Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy, he was confident they would not be deterred for long. \u201cThe president is not going to change the mind-set of anyone buying at $5,000 to $10,000 per square foot,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as the rest of the world is in worse shape, we\u2019re going to see continued investment.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/realestate/trump-policy-impact-on-real-estate-still-unclear.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T16:06:57-04:00", "abstract": "A few months into the Trump presidency, foreign real estate investment in his hometown continues to be strong, but there are skeptics.", "title": "Trump Policy Impact on Real Estate Still Unclear", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Real Estate", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T16:06:57-04:00"}
