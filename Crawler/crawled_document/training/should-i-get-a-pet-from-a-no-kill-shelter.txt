I am looking into getting a new cat or cats. My dilemma is where: 1. A no-kill animal shelter; 2. A shelter that euthanizes animals if there are too many. Do I opt for the kill shelter \u2014 thereby saving lives? Or support the no-kill shelter? M. Watkin, Cobden, Ill. In your view, it\u2019s wrong to kill a cat humanely (as we say, rather oddly) if no one wants to have it as a pet. This is a topic on which there are strong and conflicting beliefs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is highly critical of no-kill policies, given the realities of our animal shelters: Warehousing animals in cages for long periods is cruel, the group says, and the attempt to find homes for these creatures is \u201clike bailing out a sinking ship with a teaspoon.\u201d PETA wants us to head off the problem by sterilizing more animals, thereby reducing the number of homeless ones. Groups like the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals suggest, more diplomatically, that \u201cno kill\u201d is a noble aspiration but often imperfect in practice, as it results in warehousing and overcrowding. I myself have concluded that it can be O.K. to kill creatures that don\u2019t have projects as long as you don\u2019t cause them suffering. (Human beings, unlike other creatures, have lives they\u2019re making whose interruption deprives them of something significant.) That\u2019s why I am not a vegetarian but favor strong animal-welfare legislation for livestock. My aim, however, isn\u2019t to push you toward a particular position. On these issues, there is a range of arguments to reckon with. I\u2019d simply urge you to take the time to do so. Given your current assumptions, Options 1 and 2 each have something to be said for them. Option 1 supports an organization that won\u2019t euthanize the animals it shelters. Option 2 means that you adopt an animal that could have been euthanized. (You might think you\u2019d also lessen the chance that other animals will be killed, but PETA has a point about that teaspoon.) Because \u201cadoption fees\u201d are meant to help cover the cost of the rescue, you could give the \u201cno-kill\u201d shelter money and take your cat or cats from a \u201ckill\u201d shelter, thus achieving both goals. But do keep your eye on the larger questions of animal welfare. A \u201cno-kill\u201d shelter may use the money unwisely and still cause animal deaths when fatal illnesses result from overcrowding. Be sure your issues with PETA, the H.S.U.S. or the A.S.P.C.A. survive research and consideration. My mother recently remarried, and her new husband has a young daughter. My stepsister spends most of her time with her mother, but she spends some weekends and holidays with her dad and my mom. My mother was a decent parent (I\u2019m 22), but she has always been self-involved and insensitive. Whenever I spend time with her and my stepsister, I notice my mom acting in ways that were hurtful to me as a child. I feel I have some responsibility to protect this kid, but when I broach the topic, my mother gets very upset. Should I back off and commiserate with my stepsister when she\u2019s old enough? Or is there a way to talk about this to my mom that will let me help the child in a more immediate way? Name Withheld Have you made it clear that what you are saying is based in your own experience? If you\u2019ve already done so and she hasn\u2019t changed her behavior, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth insisting. Take consolation in the fact that your stepsister spends less time with your mother than you did (and has her own mother as well), and that you\u2019ll be around to talk it through with her later. Our child goes to a private school that we cannot afford. A relative pays the tuition. The school offers financial aid, which we qualify for. However, our relative could, and would, pay the full fee if needed. It seems wrong to ask our relative to pay more than we are actually charged. But it also seems wrong to take aid when other families may not have this resource. The school does not ask about family resources; we are disclosing everything they ask for. What is the ethical thing to do? Name Withheld You\u2019ve filled out the financial-aid forms correctly, you report, but you have a stream of income that the forms don\u2019t reveal, namely the gift from your richer relative. So you\u2019re not lying. (That\u2019s good!) But if the school knew about this other stream, it would probably ask you for more. You\u2019re taking advantage of what you see as a glitch in the system. (Not so good.) Given that you wouldn\u2019t disadvantage your child if you pointed this out, the only reason not to do so is to spare your relative the extra burden. But if the financial-aid system were properly administered, you\u2019d turn out to be undercharged. So you should tell the school that they ought to modify the forms to ask: How much assistance are you receiving from others toward school fees? My mother is from Central America. She came to the United States for college and met my American father. I am, therefore, 50 percent Latino genetically, but I don\u2019t identify as Latino. There were (to my regret) no Central American influences in my upbringing \u2014 no Spanish language, no Latino relatives, no foods from \u201cthe old country.\u201d There was also no discrimination directed at me or my mother (we look \u201cwhite\u201d). Is it ethical to identify as Latino in social situations and on the census? Name Withheld Our ethnic and racial categories drape loosely around the realities of our complex lives. I am the son of an English woman and a Ghanaian man. I am an American citizen. Am I a black American? African-American? Anglo-American? Anglo-African? \u201cLatino\u201d is a word that hovers uneasily between a category defined by culture and one defined by descent. The latter conception makes you Latino. The former doesn\u2019t quite. There\u2019s also a notion that ethnicity should be defined by your own sense of identity \u2014 by whether you think of yourself as Latino. But whether you think of yourself as Latino is shaped by ideas about culture and descent. There isn\u2019t a single correct view about that. Still, here\u2019s a solution: In cases in which you don\u2019t have the time or space to explain your situation, probably the least confusing thing to say to people in the United States is that your mother is Latina. (As far as forms go, if they permit you to check two boxes, I\u2019d do that. If they don\u2019t, I don\u2019t believe it matters much what you do.)", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/magazine/should-i-get-a-pet-from-a-no-kill-shelter.html", "material_type_facet": "News", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:23-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "title": "Should I Get a Pet From a No-Kill Shelter?", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:23-04:00"}
