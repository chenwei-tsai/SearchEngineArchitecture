{"text": "The United States will not grant a waiver to Exxon Mobil or any other American companies for drilling that is forbidden by sanctions against Russia, the Treasury Department said on Friday. In a one-sentence statement, the department said the decision was made in consultation with President Trump. The decision came after reports this week that Exxon had applied for a waiver in 2015 after President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea. According to a former State Department official and an oil industry official, Exxon sought the waiver so it could drill in the Black Sea in a venture with Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. The request put the Trump administration in an awkward position because of reports of Russian efforts to influence the United States presidential election and because Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was Exxon\u2019s chief executive.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/business/energy-environment/treasury-exxon-mobil-sanctions-waiver.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T14:18:42-04:00", "abstract": "The Treasury Department said the decision was made in consultation with President Trump.", "title": "U.S. Rejects Exxon Mobil Bid for Waiver on Russia Sanctions", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Business Day", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T14:19:37-04:00"}
