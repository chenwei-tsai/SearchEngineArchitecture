{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Before Mac DeMarco bought a lovely blue home with a pool on a quiet hill here in Silver Lake \u2014 the first real adult spoils of a surprising career built on seeming like an affable deadbeat \u2014 he gave out his exact address to fans, not exactly expecting them to show up in droves. \u201cStop on by \u2014 I\u2019ll make you a cup of coffee,\u201d Mr. DeMarco, a mischievous singer and songwriter, said on a whim at the end of \u201cMy House by the Water,\u201d an instrumental track from 2015. His place, a four-bedroom on the beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, was relatively secluded, directly across Jamaica Bay from Kennedy International Airport. But accessibility aside, people soon started showing up, and they didn\u2019t really stop for the next six months. \u201cWe had thousands of kids, all through the day, all hours,\u201d Mr. DeMarco recalled recently as he chain-smoked Marlboro Reds in his new backyard, surrounded by overflowing ashtrays and discarded cans of beer and seltzer. It was crazy. I really liked it.\u201d True to his word and reputation, he played amiable host to those making the Rockaway pilgrimage \u2014 his longtime girlfriend, Kiera McNally, \u201cwas a good sport for as long as she could be\u201d \u2014 even as summer bloomed and space got tight. \u201cSometimes we\u2019d have like 40 people sitting against the sea wall watching us rehearse,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said, insisting that the impetuous stunt did not lead to any negative experiences and only brought him closer to his fan base. That\u2019s the kind of easygoing intimacy and relatability that has turned Mr. DeMarco, who is originally from Edmonton, Alberta, into what has become a rare breed: a breakout indie-rock idol whose consistent musical output \u2014 mostly mellow guitar pop in the mold of \u201960s and \u201970s songwriters like Harry Nilsson, Neil Young and John Lennon \u2014 is only bolstered by a fervent cult of personality. As a kind of pied piper for the blog crowd, Mr. DeMarco, with his trademark gaptoothed smile and disarming baby blues, has tended to his flock not so much with the dubiously revealing gimmicks of social media, but on-the-ground, grass-roots outreach via nonstop touring and direct human connection. His new album, \u201cThis Old Dog,\u201d out Friday, May 5, is his third full-length LP and fifth release in five years on the independent Brooklyn label Captured Tracks, with each enjoying exponential growth. (\u201cSalad Days,\u201d his previous album, sold more than 100,000 copies in the United States.) But instead of blowing out his sound for bigger festival stages and more crossover opportunities, Mr. DeMarco has knowingly pulled back with a collection of his softest, most personal songs, recorded at home in Los Angeles, mostly on acoustic guitar. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, as things progress, I just want to keep making them smaller and smaller,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said, his natural inclination toward a do-it-yourself punk ethos shining through. \u201cI try to retain a certain amount of control. I\u2019m not a freak, but I don\u2019t want to do anything that I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d He also seemed to recognize how crucial a sense of connectedness has been to his success. Approachable, genuine and undeniably charismatic, Mr. DeMarco, who turns 27 on Sunday, April 30, is a recognizable archetype to anyone familiar with small-time local music scenes \u2014 a trendsetting merrymaker likely to get drunk and pull down his pants onstage, but who also happens to be a devoted songwriter. \u201cI\u2019m not the artiste \u2014 we\u2019re just having a good time,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said, recalling being drawn as a teenager to bands \u201cthat made me go, \u2018Oh, I can do this, too!\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cKids tune in and they\u2019re like, \u2018Mac would drink a beer with me.\u2019 And the answer is probably yes! These people are paying my mortgage, putting food on the table for me and my girlfriend. Thank you! And you like the music? That\u2019s crazy.\u201d But as grateful as he is for the support, Mr. DeMarco was realistic and self-aware in acknowledging that his irreverent rock \u2019n\u2019 roll prankster vibe and sense of humor \u2014 onstage, in legend and in countless playful YouTube videos \u2014 has spawned a following almost apart from his solid yet unassuming songs. \u201cI\u2019m like a meme,\u201d he said. \u201cMy music is one thing, and then there\u2019s also this weird personality that people attach to it.\u201d That comes with expectations. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s like, \u2018Put the cigarette between your teeth, man!\u2019 But I did that already.\u201d Yet some bewilderment aside, Mr. DeMarco insisted that he harbors no existential anxiety about the jester role, mostly because it\u2019s not a character. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to keep public Mac and me Mac fairly in line with one another so it doesn\u2019t become weird,\u201d he said. It also provides a firewall for his art. Mike Sniper, the founder of Captured Tracks, who signed Mr. DeMarco solely on the strength of songs uploaded to Bandcamp, marveled at the multiple facets of the singer\u2019s career. \u201cHe\u2019s given himself total privacy in his own music to make whatever he wants,\u201d Mr. Sniper said. \u201cWho else is afforded to be that serious as a musician and that goofy in person? I can\u2019t think of anyone who can pull that off as well as he has.\u201d Mr. DeMarco toured and released music in Canadian obscurity, mostly under the name Makeout Videotape, for years before he signed to a label with any influence. When he did, releasing the more experimental, lo-fi \u201cRock and Roll Nightclub\u201d in 2012 on Captured Tracks, the indie-rock stars were aligning. The label, which had success with groups like Dum Dum Girls, Wild Nothing and Beach Fossils, had become \u201cPitchfork\u2019s darling,\u201d Mr. Sniper said of the gatekeeping music website, which was once a peerless tastemaker in that world and began championing Mr. DeMarco. \u201cWhatever cultural cachet we had, he really took advantage of it and went nuts from there,\u201d Mr. Sniper said. Mr. DeMarco\u2019s freewheeling, wide-scale debut also came on the heels of a more self-serious moment in the genre, which was dominated by headliners like Animal Collective, Arcade Fire and Dirty Projectors. \u201cI played the internet game a lot in the first couple years,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said. \u201cA lot of videos, a lot of interviews, a lot of content.\u201d He added, \u201cA lot of bands don\u2019t give it up like I do, I guess.\u201d Even today, Mr. DeMarco\u2019s every move is parsed online by obsessives. In addition to his rapper-esque 643,000 Instagram followers, the active r/macdemarco Reddit community includes speculation about not only his songwriting but also fluctuations in his weight (\u201cAnybody else concerned with Mac\u2019s recent decline in physical health?\u201d), his finances and his relationship with Ms. McNally, who has become a co-star among the cast of characters in Mac World. Another is Agnes, Mr. DeMarco\u2019s mother, who has leaned into her niche celebrity status and now runs her son\u2019s official, tongue-in-cheek fan club. \u201cRight off the hop, these kids wanted to be my Facebook friend,\u201d Ms. DeMarco said in an interview. She described her son as a curious and enthusiastic child, who was \u201cperhaps a bit of a rabble-rouser \u2014 very, very full of energy, much like he is now.\u201d She added: \u201cHe draws people to him. Mac always traveled in a herd of kids, and even if they didn\u2019t want to like him, they ended up liking him.\u201d Mr. DeMarco\u2019s immediate loved ones have long featured in his music as well as his career, though he favors what he called \u201cvague, pretty common themes and not very specific lyrics \u2014 little pop song nuggets.\u201d But on \u201cThis Old Dog,\u201d which Mr. DeMarco started at the Rockaway house and returned to after his move to California, he got more thematically pointed than ever, calling the songs \u201cdiary-entry style.\u201d The opening track, \u201cMy Old Man,\u201d plainly addresses the father he grew up without and who struggled with addiction (\u201cUh-oh, looks like I\u2019m seeing more of my old man in me\u201d). The album was inspired in part by the two reconnecting under dire circumstances: a cancer diagnosis. \u201cI\u2019d say see you later, if I thought I\u2019d see you later and I\u2019d tell you that I loved you if I did,\u201d Mr. DeMarco sings in \u201cMoonlight on the River.\u201d The album ends on the line: \u201cAnd even though you barely know each other, it still hurts watching him fade away.\u201d \u201cIt was my \u2018See you later, partner,\u2019\u201d Mr. DeMarco said of the low-key LP, its sound stemming from the singer\u2019s recent deep-dives into the careers of Paul Simon, James Taylor and Yellow Magic Orchestra. But in a twist, his father has since recovered to an extent, outlasting his diagnosis. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he would ever hear the songs,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said. \u201cNow he\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m baaack,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, [expletive].\u201d That this introspective moment coincides with Mr. DeMarco\u2019s turning a corner into his late 20s and adjusting his lifestyle accordingly is probably not a coincidence. \u201cI have retracted a little bit from just giving everything away,\u201d he said of his public persona. But maturation is a funny thing for a singer whose generous high jinks are foundational to his popularity. At his home in Los Angeles, those contradictions were on display as domesticity coexisted with the Neverland aspects of playing rock for a living. Guitars and gear were strewn in almost every room, and band mates had colonized the extra space, all while Ms. McNally baked sourdough bread and cinnamon buns, reminding Mr. DeMarco to take his fiber supplement. (He ate a spoonful of frosting instead.) \u201cI\u2019ve lived in way too many crawlspace rooms,\u201d Mr. DeMarco remarked, taking in his yard with astonishment and uttering a string of curse words for emphasis. \u201cIt\u2019s such a fluke, so lucky and so amazing,\u201d he said motioning over the pool, which at that point he had yet to swim in. \u201cLook at this! See this! From playing guitar? It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/music/mac-demarco-this-old-dog-interview.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:37-04:00", "abstract": "The singer-songwriter has acquired a devoted following by offering up almost full access to his slacker life.", "title": "How Mac DeMarco Became the Lovable Laid-Back Prince of Indie Rock"}
