But she instinctively understood it: \u201cIt\u2019s my childhood.\u201d", "text": "There\u2019s a ballet dancer on the television show \u201cThe Americans,\u201d but she doesn\u2019t dance one step. And that makes for a happy ballerina. Irina Dvorovenko, a former principal with American Ballet Theater, has been quietly forging a second career as an actress since she left the company in 2013. The same month that she retired from Ballet Theater, she triumphed as Vera Baronova in the Encores! production of \u201cOn Your Toes\u201d at City Center. Her success was a surprise \u2014 even to her. While Vera is a standard part for a ballet dancer \u2014 George Balanchine choreographed the first Broadway production in 1936 \u2014 what really stood out was Ms. Dvorovenko\u2019s unassailable comic timing. She was hooked. Acting turned into a passion, just as ballet had once been. Since then, her most prominent role had been as a drug-addicted ballerina on the Starz series \u201cFlesh and Bone.\u201d But with this season of FX\u2019s \u201cThe Americans,\u201d on which she plays the Soviet \u00e9migr\u00e9 Evgheniya Morozova, the game has changed. \u201cIt\u2019s a different character for me,\u201d she said in a recent interview at Cafe Fiorello near Lincoln Center, where her name \u2014 along with that of her dancer-husband, Maxim Beloserkovsky, and their daughter, Emma \u2014 is inscribed on a plaque in one of the booths. \u201cI really want to be seen as a different person and to show an absolutely different side of me. Nothing related to dance.\u201d On \u201cThe Americans,\u201d which stars Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys as undercover Soviet spies in the United States during the Cold War, Ms. Dvorovenko plays a forlorn, isolated woman with a depressed son and a husband who has embraced his new country. Ms. Dvorovenko is somewhat unrecognizable in the role: Sallow and drawn, her usually glittering sapphire eyes disappear into the camera with piercing melancholy. As it happens, it\u2019s not the biggest stretch. \u201cIt\u2019s my childhood,\u201d she said. Ms. Dvorovenko, born in 1973, grew up in Ukraine with dancer parents and studied gymnastics before entering ballet school at 10. For her, the show\u2019s time period has brought back a flood of memories. Many have to do with hunting for food. (In the transcript of our interview, that word comes up 21 times.) In one scene, her character shows dismay at the abundance of groceries in the United States; Ms. Dvorovenko said she understands Evgheniya\u2019s shock. \u201cWhen perestroika happened, the stores were completely empty,\u201d she said, adding that her husband remembers waiting, at the age of 10 or 11, for a store to open and grabbing whatever he could. \u201cThey were literally bending the metal cages to grab the raw chicken. We never had gyms \u2014 the workout was eight or 10 hours a day to run all over the area to find the food in any possible store. Women never smiled.\u201d While on tour with the National Opera and Ballet Theater of Ukraine in the early 1990s, she said she and her fellow dancers were on a mission: to bring home as much food as possible. Ms. Dvorovenko pointed to a table to indicate how large her bag was. \u201cYou unzip, unzip, unzip?\u201d she said, with a giggle. \u201cYou have, like, a dead body in it.\u201d The show\u2019s wardrobe brings back memories, too. Ms. Dvorovenko\u2019s description of it? Ugly. \u201cThe only colors people were wearing were brown, black and dark gray,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents were different because they were traveling to the West to perform, and they were buying fancy clothes. I was embarrassed to wear them because none of my childhood friends had any.\u201d Clearly Ms. Dvorovenko had the experience to play Evgheniya. But before she could nail the role, she had to tone down her look. Willowy and seductive, with a deep voice and a contagious smile, Ms. Dvorovenko is no wallflower. After her first audition, she was deemed too glamorous. Her husband gave her some advice. He told her to take a ballet class, clean the apartment, have a fight with their daughter and cry. \u201cHe said, \u2018Then you\u2019ll be totally miserable,\u2019\u201d she recounted. Instead, she took off her makeup, pulled out her cellphone and shot a video of herself. \u201cI put on a different attitude and I just said a few words: \u2018My name is Irina Dvorovenko, and I\u2019m auditioning for the role of Evgheniya.\u2019\u201d They called her back the next morning. \u201cI came very plain in a T-shirt, and they felt my sensitive side and vulnerability and also the struggle with what I\u2019m going through as a mother \u2014 as a normal person,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not all the time chic and glamorous. I also can be sad and have real problems.\u201d Chris Long, an executive producer and director, said: \u201cWe made her work hard to get this part. It was very important to us that this family worked. One of the great things about casting these Russians is you never want to see them in any way act. She has a beautiful naturalness to her.\u201d Ms. Dvorovenko appears in nine of 13 episodes this season and doesn\u2019t yet know if she will return for the show\u2019s next and final season. But in the fall, she\u2019ll participate in her second workshop of Susan Stroman\u2019s \u201cThe Beast in the Jungle,\u201d a story told through music, dance and narration that is loosely based on the Henry James novella. Ms. Dvorovenko portrays May, a ballerina, at ages 20, 40 and 60. \u201cIt was incredible to live the full life of the character,\u201d she said. Ms. Stroman, in an email, noted Ms. Dvorovenko\u2019s depth and warmth, which allowed for May\u2019s \u201ccurious nature and her intellect to shine through.\u201d And Ms. Dvorovenko is eager to continue acting. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking all my life onstage inside my head,\u201d she said. \u201cEven for nonstory ballets, I would talk inside. And now I have a crazy urge for people to be able to see me closely. Not just my movements, but to look in my eyes.\u201d She shook her head firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t miss \u2018Swan Lake.\u2019\u201d Or, it seems, the ballet world. \u201cThrough my career, I never felt important,\u201d she said. But making \u201cThe Americans\u201d feels different. \u201cHere is a team of people who actually believe in you, and they know their business and they navigate and nourish you.\u201d She recalled a look that a veteran cameraman gave her after a difficult scene. \u201cIt was a little glimpse of something like, \u2018Kid, you\u2019re doing well,\u2019\u201d Ms. Dvorovenko said. \u201cLittle things sometimes make such a huge difference, right? It gave me so much encouragement and strength.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/dance/irina-dvorovenko-the-americans.html", "material_type_facet": "News", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:32-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "title": "I Don\u2019t Miss \u2018Swan Lake\u2019: A Ballerina\u2019s Role on \u2018The Americans\u2019", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:32-04:00"}
