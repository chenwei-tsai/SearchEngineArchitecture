{"abstract": "With his understanding of the web, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has extended the reach of his message and drawn the support of a new generation of online commentators.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "PARIS \u2014 In Fiscal Kombat, an online video game introduced this month by the presidential campaign of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, France\u2019s far-left candidate, players shake down men in suits to put money into the public coffers, Robin Hood-style. It\u2019s one way Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, 65, has been winning over young voters. His campaign has been gaining steam not only because of his energized rallies \u2014 he sometimes beams in by hologram to address multiple cities at once \u2014 and his platform. He has also been far more web savvy than his rivals, running what may be France\u2019s first viral campaign. It\u2019s a wild-card factor all the more potent and vital since neither he nor the centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, the front-runner by a narrow margin, represents a traditional political party or has its infrastructure. When French voters go to the polls on Sunday for the first round of elections, they will do so after a campaign that has moved beyond rallies and other traditional events and migrated online for the first time. With some polls showing as many as 30 percent of the voters still undecided, every vote will count \u2014 and so will every \u201clike.\u201d Far-right websites, an ecosystem often referred to as the Fachosph\u00e8re, have long given oxygen to Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front, which was the first French party to create a website. And the left has traditionally had intense ideological debates in the mainstream news media. In this campaign, however, in which the left is split among several candidates, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, a former Trotskyite and longtime Socialist senator before breaking ranks, has more YouTube followers than any rival and a league of active online supporters eager to jump on critics. \u201cMarine Le Pen has made an effort for years: It\u2019s a sociological vote; it\u2019s a crisis; it\u2019s people who feel shut out of the system,\u201d said Thierry Vedel, a political scientist who conducts election research at Sciences Po, a university in Paris. \u201cM\u00e9lenchon is more complicated. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s campaign is trying. We can\u2019t rule out that in the campaign, social media has had an effect.\u201d That\u2019s especially true on the left, where voters are deciding among Mr. M\u00e9lenchon; Mr. Macron, a 39-year-old centrist, former banker and finance minister under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a Socialist; and Beno\u00eet Hamon, a Socialist who comes from the party\u2019s leftist wing and whose flagging campaign represents that party\u2019s implosion. Enter the video game. The idea for Fiscal Kombat came from Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s grass-roots supporters, who created an online community, Le Discord Insoumis, or \u201cDefiant Discord\u201d \u2014 using the Discord gaming software \u2014 to debate ideas and find new ways to push his program. That program includes taking France out of NATO, renegotiating its treaties with the European Union, eliminating nuclear power, raising taxes and capping wages. In the final weeks of the campaign, those supporters have been out in force. When the satirical cartoonist Joann Sfar took to his own Facebook page, which has 33,000 followers, to criticize Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, he was attacked by M\u00e9lenchon supporters. Mr. Sfar wrote in Le Monde last week that he had actually intended to vote for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon but changed his mind after the attacks. \u201cObama won going door to door. M\u00e9lenchon has managed to create a kind of numerical door-to-door, to stir up his base on the internet since he\u2019s moved people with very strong speeches,\u201d said Vincent Glad, a journalist for the left-wing daily Lib\u00e9ration who covers the intersection of social media and politics. \u201cThat creates a dynamic in the country that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are really keyed up and comment a lot.\u201d In contrast, Mr. Macron has used the internet in a more traditional way: publishing speeches on his website and putting out information about rallies. But in a first for France, his campaign has deployed an American-style campaign tactic: using software to identify pockets of undecided voters to try to win them over. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, who has a history of sparring with the mainstream media, has taken it up a notch, using the internet to bypass rules governing equal media exposure. He now has about 307,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel and 927,000 Facebook followers (compared with 1.3 million for Ms. Le Pen). He delivers long speeches on YouTube, and some clips of his media appearances have had as many as five million views. His fans have set up a web page with pro-M\u00e9lenchon graphics and GIFs for easy sharing online. He also has the support of a new generation of online political commentators. Usul, a homegrown Marxist YouTube political commentator, gave his implicit endorsement. Osons Causer, a left-wing YouTube outlet that loosely translates as Dare to Discuss and that produced some of the most viewed videos in France this election season, backed him on Friday. (Both Osons Causer and Usul have been making videos this election season for the muckraking left-wing news outlet Mediapart.) Osons Causer and Usul are no fans of Mr. Hamon, the socialist, but they seem to have particular antipathy toward Mr. Macron, whom they see as the establishment candidate, a dynamic not unlike how supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders viewed his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton. On Sunday, Osons Causer, which usually features Ludo Torbey, one of the site\u2019s founders, sitting in his bedroom talking viewers through complex topics on politics and economics, published a video, \u201cIf You\u2019re Hesitating About Voting for Macron, Watch This.\u201d It was harshly critical of the candidate\u2019s economic policies and his efforts to overhaul the French labor market under Mr. Hollande. By Friday afternoon, it had been viewed 392,000 times. In addition, the video \u201cWho Really Is Emmanuel Macron?\u201d was the most shared one in France from early February to early March, according to a study by Linkfluence, a French firm that monitors social media impact. \u201cIt\u2019s our moment,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Lambert, one of three founders of Osons Causer, who are 28 to 30 years old and attended Paris\u2019s Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV, as did Mr. Macron. Started in June 2015 (the third founder is Xavier Cheung), the show has nearly 500,000 Facebook followers, up from 400,000 in January. (Le Monde, France\u2019s paper of record, has three million.) Usul agrees. \u201cA lot of young people are trying to discover Socialism,\u201d he said by telephone. Even if Mr. M\u00e9lenchon loses, \u201cwe\u2019ve entered a phase when social movements will be more important, more structured, more radical,\u201d he said, citing Spain\u2019s leftist Podemos party as a model. \u201cWe\u2019ll move from defense to attack.\u201d (In one of the more surreal twists, Usul is the pseudonym of a 31-year-old journalist in Lyon who has never revealed his name.) These YouTubers haven\u2019t exactly replaced the mainstream media in France, but they\u2019ve gone viral in ways that more established media outlets have not. \u201cThe mechanics of \u2018virality\u2019 on Facebook allows a form of inequality between different media,\u201d said Guilhem Fouetillou, a founder of Linkfluence, which he said had sold its software to more than one of the five top candidates. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an audience a priori; sharing something on Facebook lets you create an audience that\u2019s also as important as the old media,\u201d he added. There are outliers. One newspaper without a website has played an outsize role in the election: the satirical print weekly Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9. In January, it broke the story that accused Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the center-right candidate, of putting his wife and children on the public payroll, leading to embezzlement charges that have dogged his campaign. But social media kept the scandal alive \u2014 so much so that Mr. Fillon was the candidate most discussed online, according to Linkfluence. Even though social media has helped bolster Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s campaign, Mr. Vedel, of Sciences Po, warned against drawing too direct a line between social media activity and electoral results. \u201cToday, social media doesn\u2019t always reflect opinion; that\u2019s the problem,\u201d he said. He added that much chatter during the campaign could be \u201cfilter bubbles,\u201d in which people share information that reinforces their own ideas. The Google News Lab in Paris, a division of the search engine company, found that the most searched candidates in recent weeks were Mr. Macron and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon. Among the top questions: \u201cIs Emmanuel Macron left or right?\u201d and \u201cWhy vote for M\u00e9lenchon?\u201d Of the searches for Ms. Le Pen last week, the top question: \u201cWhy not vote for Le Pen?\u201d", "section": "World", "title": "A French Campaign Waged Online Adds a Wild Card to the Election", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/world/europe/france-election-jean-luc-melenchon-web.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T09:48:31-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T09:43:05-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
