We need to take Gov. Andrew Cuomo out of the story, because it\u2019s really not about him. It\u2019s about the middle- and working-class families of New York who will benefit from this plan. You suggest that somehow the plan will \u201cplace damaging financial strains on the SUNY and CUNY systems,\u201d but don\u2019t say how. Worse, you attack the plan because of the many people it won\u2019t help, including part-time students and students from poor families. The poorest students already have some forms of financial aid. Certainly they need more. But middle-class families need help, too. As the most recent presidential election should have made clear, when we ignore the economic plight of the working class and middle class, we risk social and political collapse. Rather than complaining about what Excelsior Scholarships don\u2019t accomplish, we should celebrate this important step in the right direction \u2026 then push for more. MONA MOLARSKY, NEW YORK The writer is an independent college admissions counselor. To the Editor: I take issue with Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s claim that the New York plan for tuition-free college is the first in the nation. As a child of the 1960s who graduated from high school in Southern California, I know that the University of California was tuition-free for all residents from its founding (in 1868) up until 1975. Californians didn\u2019t brag about first in the nation status then; Mr. Cuomo shouldn\u2019t do so now, especially when it\u2019s not the case. CHLO\u00cb BULINSKI, TENAFLY, N.J. To the Editor: While I often agree with David Brooks, his analysis of the \u201cThe Cuomo College Fiasco\u201d (column, April 14) is shortsighted on numerous levels. This plan will not weaken student resolve to work hard to graduate, nor will it deter students from applying to and/or attending more prestigious or small private institutions. However, the plan may help reduce the number of hours that students need to work to afford college, it may lower graduation rates from six years toward the traditional four-year cycle, it may help to decrease student indebtedness, and it may enable some students to afford the opportunity to live on campus. Ultimately, if the state can use this law to increase the number of college graduates, it will also increase the education level of the state\u2019s work force. There are far more benefits in this plan than negatives, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo should be applauded for taking the first step in what will become a more refined process. LESLIE WILSON, MONTCLAIR, N.J. The writer is a professor at Montclair State University. To the Editor: Re \u201cTuition Plan Makes College More Affordable for a Few\u201d (news article, April 12): Your coverage of Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s Excelsior Scholarships correctly acknowledged that a large majority of the 600,000-plus students in New York State\u2019s higher education system would not qualify for the scholarship. For example, most are not able to take the required average of five classes per semester to graduate in four years. An even lower percentage of City University of New York students \u2014 many of whom must take classes part-time to fulfill family and work responsibilities \u2014 would qualify. However, the state budget has even deeper flaws: a tuition increase of $1,000 over the next five years. And because the state has not increased funding for the Tuition Assistance Program, the burden of tuition increases will fall on those who do not qualify for the Excelsior plan \u2014 mostly poor and working-class students. The Make CUNY Free Again Campaign has a better idea. We are gathering signatures to put a charter amendment on the city ballot that will return City University of New York to the tuition-free policy in place from 1847 to 1975. No restrictions, no sneaky backdoor tuition increases, just higher education as a human right.
