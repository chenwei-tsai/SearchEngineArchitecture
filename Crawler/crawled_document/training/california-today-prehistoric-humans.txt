{"text": "Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) California, cradle of the first freeways, skateboards, canned tuna fish ... Americans? A study published by the journal Nature on Wednesday made a startling claim: Turns out prehistoric humans may have arrived in what is now California 130,000 years ago. The finding, based on examination of mastodon bones found near San Diego, would upend our understanding of the arrival of people in the Americas. Currently, the earliest widely accepted evidence of settlement is less than 15,000 years old. Carl Zimmer, a science writer, explained the new study in The Times. We caught up with him via email. Q. How big is this? A. If it turned out to be true, it would be a very big deal, pushing back human occupation in the Americas over 100,000 years. But that\u2019s a very, very big \u201cif,\u201d based on my interviews with other experts. Q. You reported that there\u2019s quite a bit of skepticism. What should we make of that? A. This is part of the scientific process. Scientists develop a hypothesis to explain evidence and test it, and then it\u2019s up to other researchers to challenge its premises and find ways to test it for themselves. This particular case reveals how the standards of proof can go up when the stakes go up. If people want to make a big claim, other scientists are going to expect a lot of evidence to back it up. Experts I spoke to thought that evidence fell short in this case. Q. What would life in California have been like 130,000 years ago? A. It would be pretty nice. The weather would be comfortable, and there would be lots of grass and trees. The area was home to many big animals, including camels, giant ground sloths and dire wolves (sort of like the ones in Game of Thrones). Q. Suppose it\u2019s right, could modern Californians be related? A. It\u2019s very hard to see how any humans in California 130,000 years ago could be the ancestors of any living humans. But there were a number of other lineages of humans, such as Neanderthals, that existed in that age. They\u2019d be more likely candidates.

[The New York Times] On Tuesday, we asked for your opinions on how U.C. Berkeley has handled the commotion over Ann Coulter\u2019s plan to speak at the campus. Since the university last week canceled the event, citing safety concerns, there have been heated debates over free speech rights, a lawsuit and vows from the conservative writer to show up anyway. On Wednesday, Ms. Coulter reversed herself, saying she would not appear on Thursday after all because conservative groups pulled their support. (Writing in The Times, Nicholas Dirks, the chancellor, said Berkeley was under attack from both the far right and the far left.) With few exceptions, those who wrote to us felt Ms. Coulter should have a right to speak. But they were divided over whether it was the correct call to cancel the event. A sample of the responses: \u201cInstead of canceling her appearance, they should have let her go on as scheduled, with double or triple the number of campus police. By canceling her, they empowered those hate groups. Now those kinds of threats will never end.\u201d \u2014 Richard Jones, Truckee \u201cIf the Berkeley College Republicans are willing to provide and pay for security to keep Ann Coulter safe from violent leftist thugs, then by all means let it happen.\u201d \u2014 Stan Roe, Clayton \u201cIt is not her free speech which is being threatened here, it is her safety and the safety of people who come to hear or protest.\u201d \u2014 Claire Callahan Goodman, Oakland \u201cCoulter does indeed have the right to free speech. Berkeley, however, has no legal duty to provide her with a forum.\u201d \u2014 Zachary Lawrence, Los Angeles Want to submit a photo for possible publication? You can do it here.
