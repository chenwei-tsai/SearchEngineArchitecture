That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. The news of the world may be grim running to grimmer, but still we make time to cook, hoping that the practice can bring a balm to wounded souls. Take as an example Melissa Clark\u2019s recipe for a roasted carrot salad with arugula and pomegranate. Make it tonight while listening to Laura Marling, while enjoying a glass of wine, while talking to the children about school or your roommate about how weird the cat gets when the birds return each spring. Make it while puttering around the kitchen looking at the mail. But make it, with a spray of toasted walnuts over the top, and see how easily beauty can intrude on the mundane business of a Monday dinner, and how happy that can make you and more important others, in mid-April, 2017. Tomorrow you can amp up the heat with this excellent recipe for chicken diavolo, which Kim Severson scored from Ruth Reichl, who adapted it from a dish she once had at the restaurant Lupa in New York. I like it with a roasted potato hash, spice on spice, and some simple braised greens. I\u2019d like to cook Melissa\u2019s new recipe for pork tenderloin stuffed with herbs and capers at some point as well. Pork tenderloin gets a bad rap, often with good reason. It\u2019s quick to dry out. Not on Melissa\u2019s watch! Serve it with Martha Rose Shulman\u2019s  orzo with peas and parsley pesto, and enjoy the evening. One morning soon I\u2019ll pop some egg yolks into mirin-sweetened soy sauce with a strip of kombu, and when evening comes I\u2019ll make rice and serve soy-sauce pickled eggs for dinner, perhaps alongside some simply cooked salmon and a seaweed salad, or perhaps just with plenty of beer. You could cook pasta with parsnips and bacon. You could make Nigella Lawson\u2019s recipe for an easy pea soup. You could make cod cakes. You could roast up some eggs Kejriwal. The point is just to cook, to get out of yourself for an hour or so at the end of a long day in service to those you love, and in doing so to provide them (and you!) with sustenance and a kind of appreciation for all that surrounds us that isn\u2019t ugly or raw or painful or unkind. Some posit you could do that with boxed mac and cheese and coins of hot dogs and get the same result. They\u2019re wrong. Make food from scratch. Make it nice. It improves all that surrounds you. Many more thousands of recipes to prove that point are available for your browsing pleasure on Cooking. Go take a look, then save the recipes you\u2019re interested in to your recipe box, so you can find them later and put them to use. Affix stars to the recipes you enjoy, and please leave notes on those you\u2019ve transfigured in some interesting way. The conversations bubbling along in those recipe notes are fascinating and helpful to all. And if you run into rough waters, do reach out for help: cookingcare@nytimes.com. Now, why don\u2019t you take some time to read Jason Horowitz\u2019s utterly delightful account of his lonely Passover in Italy, where he recently moved to become The Times\u2019s new Rome bureau chief. Speaking of Italy, take a look at this video preview of Helene Stapinski\u2019s riveting new personal history, \u201cMurder in Matera,\u201d which tracks the story of her great-great grandmother Vita, who fled to the United States from southern Italy in 1892, her three children in tow, after \u2014 well, that\u2019s the mystery Helene set out to solve. And definitely read Willy Staley\u2019s excellent profile of Mike Judge. Finally, Cooking has been nominated for a couple of Webby Awards for digital excellence this year.
