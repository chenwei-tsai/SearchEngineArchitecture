The bad guys in the movies never fully understood that the menace behind Wayne\u2019s grin (\u201cWhoa, take \u2018er easy there, Pilgrim\u201d) meant he was about to deliver blazing fantasies of triumphant gunfire that would leave them dead in the dust. It\u2019s no wonder modern Florida legislators could not resist protecting actual shooters who draw and fire like John Wayne as guilt-free, \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d defenders. The film star stands tall at the National Rifle Association\u2019s National Firearms Museum \u2014 true, only as a cardboard cutout of himself. But the cardboard fantasy of the good guy gunning down the bad guy is what makes the museum work as an enjoyable escape from the life-and-death reality of American gun carnage. There are thousands of ingenious, gleaming rifles and handguns in displays about America\u2019s gun-rich history of colonialism, immigration, expansionism and vigilante justice. But it is the gallery devoted to Hollywood and its guns and good-guy shooters that best illustrates the power of fantasy now driving the modern gun rights debate. \u201cGo ahead, make my day,\u201d Clint Eastwood growled famously to a movie bad guy before dispatching him \u2014 kaboom! The museum narrative identifies the actual movie guns, not the actors, as having the \u201cstarring\u201d roles in assorted western and terrorist-fantasy shootouts. The gallery includes some of the blank rounds actually fired in movies, as opposed to the live rounds bedeviling real life beyond the film screen. During a visit, the difference between \u201cacting\u201d and \u201cacting out\u201d necessarily comes to mind. Why is there no stream of gripping films about the thousands of troubled Americans with easy access to guns who can lethally act out their darkest grievances on family and society day after day? Shooters nowadays must rise above the B-movie level to get noticed amid the 30,000-plus annual toll of gun death. They need a different twist in motive or a record-high death toll \u2014 or maybe the live delivery of death on Facebook, as happened last week \u2014 to jolt a jaded public. Inert politicians, of course, remain far more sensitive to the gun lobby than to routine gun mayhem. The N.R.A.\u2019s latest priority is rooted in its ultimate fantasy that society will be safer if ordinary Americans are allowed to routinely pack a pistol. The organization is pushing Congress to pass a national concealed-carry reciprocity law to make it easier for people with state concealed-gun permits to carry their firearms nationwide. This is part of the campaign to make gun possession ubiquitous among ordinary citizens. All states permit some concealed carry, but under vastly different safety controls. That is why opponents wisely fear that national reciprocity is a ploy to sell more guns and undermine stronger local and state gun controls. Gun safety researchers count more than 900 people killed by concealed-carry gun owners in the past decade, with only a tiny fraction of shootings ruled self-defense. Many of the deaths were suicides, and 31 were in mass shootings by concealed-carry owners. The gun lobby disputes all of this, but nevertheless opposes detailed public health research, perhaps because people could then see exactly how this nation\u2019s gun toll dwarfs that of other democracies. The N.R.A. headquarters here keeps up a fresh drumbeat for the reciprocity legislation underway in Congress, 30 minutes away from the gun museum, with more than 160 co-sponsors signed up. President Trump, who supports the idea, is scheduled to address the association\u2019s annual leadership forum on Friday in Atlanta. Both sides in the gun debate are keyed up for something John Wayne-like from the president.", "abstract": "The vision of the good guy gunning down the bad guy is driving the modern gun rights debate."}
