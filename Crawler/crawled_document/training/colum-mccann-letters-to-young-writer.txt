He admits in his new book, \u201cLetters to a Young Writer,\u201d that he tells his students that he won\u2019t be able to teach them \u201canything at all.\u201d He hopes instead to inspire them, and to \u201csave them a little time and heartbreak\u201d where possible; humble goals that he brings to this book. The advice he offers is familiar but worthwhile: Carry a small notebook everywhere (\u201cDon\u2019t lose it. Please don\u2019t lose it\u201d); read your work aloud; and study the masters (for dialogue, he recommends Louise Erdrich, Roddy Doyle, Marlon James and Elmore Leonard). And, perhaps less familiarly: Go to the gym? \u201cVery few people talk about it, but writers have to have the stamina of world-class athletes,\u201d McCann writes. \u201cThe exhaustion of sitting in the one place. \u2026 The dropping of the bucket down into the near-empty well over and over again.\u201d McCann also leads by example in perhaps the most enjoyable part of writing: choosing epigraphs. The quotes that open each of his very brief chapters provide much of their own wisdom. He recalls Zadie Smith saying something that applies to writers and anyone else with great aspirations: \u201cResign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never being satisfied.\u201d Quotable \u201cI elevate birds to a theological level of regard. They are the spirit world to me. They also represent distance. And when I see a flock of geese, I sort of yell, take me with you. They\u2019re in all my books on some level.\u201d \u2014 Howard Norman, author of \u201cMy Darling Detective,\u201d in an interview with NPR The End Is Near As summer approaches, you\u2019re probably trying to avoid thinking too closely about what it would be like to be attacked by a great white shark. But an entertaining \u2014 if harrowing \u2014 new book, \u201cAnd Then You\u2019re Dead,\u201d by Cody Cassidy and Paul Doherty, shares the science behind some of our more terrifying experiential possibilities (and non-possibilities). The co-authors start by imagining a realistic scenario: a window popping out of an airplane. What would follow? First, you hope the plane hasn\u2019t yet reached 20,000 feet. Also hope that you\u2019re on the aisle. The most someone in the window seat can hope for is sacrificial glory \u2014 being sucked only partway out, and thereby serving as \u201ca decent plug\u201d for everyone else while being battered by 600-mile-per-hour winds (oh, and suffocating). There follow chapters about somewhat less likely things, like the fate of someone raised by buzzards. And what would happen if you traveled toward the moon or the sun or Jupiter. Closer to home, what if you were buried alive? Like many readers, I imagine, I couldn\u2019t bear to look.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T10:51:48-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/colum-mccann-letters-to-young-writer.html", "item_type": "Article"}
