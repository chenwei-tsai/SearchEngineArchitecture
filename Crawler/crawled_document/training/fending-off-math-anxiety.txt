My daughter, on the other hand, was a math major, which always left me feeling like the transitional generation, capable of mastering standardized-test math problems and surviving college calculus (it\u2019s one of the pre-med requirements) but never really connecting to the beauty or power of the subject. So when I hear people talk about lack of self-confidence when it comes to numbers or intense math anxiety, I always think first of my mother, a college English professor who was terrified by the idea of calculating a 10 percent tip, and desperately grateful to leave it to any grandchild at the fourth grade level or beyond. (Little did my Depression-era mother know that I had taught her grandchildren to jack up the tips to 15 percent; it would never have occurred to her that anyone would willingly undergo both a slightly more difficult arithmetic problem and a slightly higher cost.) New research shows that math anxiety is by no means an American problem, and is found in countries where students regularly outperform us in math skills. In a study published in February, researchers from the University of Chicago looked at data from 64 countries participating in the Program for International Student Assessment, which tests 15-year-olds in math, science and reading skills. \u201cMath anxiety is prevalent all around the world,\u201d said Julianne Herts, a study author and a doctoral student at the University of Chicago who works in cognitive psychology. \u201cIf you look within Japan, students in Japan who are math anxious aren\u2019t scoring as well at math,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look between countries, countries where more students experience math anxiety tend to underperform.\u201d So does being \u201cbad at math,\u201d whatever that is, make you anxious, or does being anxious make you bad at math? \u201cThere\u2019s increasing reason to believe it\u2019s a bidirectional relation,\u201d said Alana Foley, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago in developmental psychology, who was the first author of the study. \u201cPoor performance in math does lead to math anxiety, but there are also studies that point in the other direction; if you have math anxiety it disrupts your concentration.\u201d Even students who score high on math tests can feel a special worry around this subject, Dr. Foley said. Among high-performing students, she said, \u201cmath anxiety takes a bigger bite out of their performance.\u201d Other researchers involved in the study traced math anxiety back further into early childhood. Sian Beilock, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago and the author of the book \u201cChoke,\u201d about performance and pressure, said that math anxiety \u201coftentimes relates most strongly to the performance of those kids who want to do well, who tend to be high achieving in school.\u201d A couple of years ago, Dr. Beilock and her colleagues published an article showing that parental math anxiety could be transmitted to children (you can take a test based on the assessment they used, to look at your own level of math anxiety). \u201cThe moral of the story is that parents likely play an important role, either for the positive or the negative,\u201d she said. There has been some overlap demonstrated between math anxiety and other more general types of anxiety, especially related to test-taking, but math anxiety seems to exist as a separate phenomenon; studies have shown increased heart rates when people were tested on math, but not on other subjects. One problem is that we tend to believe with math that you either have the ability or you don\u2019t, rather than assuming that your skills and abilities are the result of study and practice. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting phenomenon in our culture to hear highly intelligent people bragging about not being good at math, not being numbers people,\u201d Dr. Beilock said. Dr. Susan Levine, chairwoman of the department of psychology at the University of Chicago, agreed: \u201cAn educated person doesn\u2019t go around saying, I\u2019m not a reading person.\u201d Researchers believe that the skills \u2014 and the anxiety \u2014 are actually shaped even before children start formally learning math. Dr. Levine said, \u201ca lot of my work starts in the preschool years with the thesis that math learning begins at home.\u201d Math skills at kindergarten entry, she said, predict not only later math achievement but also other important skills, including reading. \u201cThere\u2019s some research out there that shows that when kids enter the kindergarten door behind in math, it\u2019s hard to close the gap,\u201d she said. So what are those crucial math skills in early childhood? Dr. Levine said that although many preschool children know how to count, they don\u2019t necessarily understand the meaning of the number words. By the time children are around 2, \u201cThey can recite the count list up to maybe 10,\u201d she said, but \u201cthey don\u2019t understand that the last number you reach is the set size; they don\u2019t connect the counting\u201d to the total. With children from 2\u00bd to 4, \u201cparents are often shocked when we bring kids into the lab,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know the kids can count, but when we ask them to give me two of something they just grab a bunch of things.\u201d By kindergarten, children have additional skills; for example, they can understand that you can make five by holding up three fingers on one hand and two on the other, or four and one. Dr. Levine said they also can demonstrate what is known as flexible counting \u2014 that is, they can start from four or five, without going all the way back to one, or count backward. \u201cParents embrace as part of their responsibility to get kids ready to read in school to introduce them to the alphabet and letter sounds,\u201d Dr. Levine said. \u201cThey\u2019re much more likely to think it\u2019s the school\u2019s job to teach math.\u201d Whether we realize it or not, the researchers say, those of us who get worried around math probably are less likely to talk about numbers and number concepts to our children. In a 2015 study, parents used a program called \u201cBedtime Math,\u201d a mobile app that presented short numerical story problems to their children; the children\u2019s math skills improved relative to children in a control group, Dr. Beilock said, but the improvement was strongest in children whose parents had math anxiety. Working with the app might help dispel the myth that there are math people and non-math people, said Dr. Levine, and make parents less anxious and more willing to introduce math talk into their daily lives (let\u2019s put five raisins in each cookie; let\u2019s set the table, how many forks do we need?). \u201cThink of math as something that\u2019s the purview of the home, not just the school,\u201d Dr. Beilock said.", "published_date": "2017-04-23T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Well", "abstract": "Parents can help by starting to talk to children at an early age about numbers in everyday life.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/well/family/fending-off-math-anxiety.html", "source": "The New York Times"}
