The network, which reported on the decision, called it a British-government-sanctioned attempt to interfere with freedom of speech. It was the latest controversy for the network, RT, originally and still commonly known as Russia Today. The broadcaster presents itself as an alternative to the Western media, but critics call it a Kremlin-financed mouthpiece that seeks to create an alternative to reality. \u201cLong live freedom of speech!\u201d Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, wrote sarcastically on Twitter, adding that the bank had offered no explanation for the step. The network released a letter from the bank, NatWest, telling the broadcaster to take its business elsewhere. In the letter, the bank said that it would stop serving RT on Dec. 12, that the decision had come after \u201ccareful consideration\u201d and that it was not subject to appeal. (The broadcaster initially reported that its accounts had been frozen, but it later clarified that the bank was closing the accounts, not freezing them, and that RT was still able to withdraw its money.) NatWest\u2019s corporate parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, said in a statement on Monday that \u201cthese decisions are not taken lightly.\u201d \u201cWe are reviewing the situation and are contacting the customer to discuss this further,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe bank accounts remain open and are still operative.\u201d Britain\u2019s Treasury said the government was not involved in the bank\u2019s decision. \u201cThis is a matter for NatWest, not for the government,\u201d a spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity under government protocol. \u201cWe as the U.K. government haven\u2019t changed the sanctions and obligations related to Russia since February 2015. For that reason, this is a decision that only NatWest has made, possibly based on their own risk appetite.\u201d RT presents itself as an independent and credible alternative to mainstream Western media, but its broadcasts repeatedly show the West as a sea of chaos. Ofcom, the British broadcast regulator, has singled out RT repeatedly for its lack of impartiality. RT\u2019s defense has been that its viewers expect alternative viewpoints. Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, linked the bank\u2019s decision to the June 23 referendum in Britain, when voters opted to leave the European Union, an outcome that has plunged the country into economic and legal uncertainty. \u201cIt appears that in leaving the E.U., London has left all of its obligations on free speech behind in Europe,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. In a statement on its website, RT called the bank\u2019s decision \u201cincomprehensible and without warning.\u201d The network said the decision was part of a pattern in Britain and Europe in recent years to \u201costracize, shout down or downright impede the work of RT.\u201d Dmitry K. Kiselyov, the head of RT\u2019s parent organization, was placed on the European sanctions list in 2014 over his encouragement of the annexation of Crimea. Barclays, the company\u2019s previous bank in Britain, closed its accounts in July 2015. In Moscow, the management of RT said on Monday that its lawyers were dealing with the banking situation and that the network would remain in operation. \u201cWe have no idea what this is connected with, because nothing new happened to us, and we received no threats \u2014 neither yesterday, nor a day before yesterday, or a month ago,\u201d the RBK news website quoted Ms. Simonyan, the editor in chief, as saying. Jonathan Eyal, assistant director of Russian and European security studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said that the bank\u2019s action might have reflected concerns over RT\u2019s links to the Kremlin. \u201cCertain questions are being raised over the corporation and its sources of funding,\u201d he said, \u201cand the bank must have been aware that this is not a happy commercial transaction.\u201d Mr. Eyal noted that some financial institutions had recently faced large fines for handling questionable accounts, and he speculated that NatWest may \u201cprefer the controversy of closing the bank account over dealing with a business that may have tainted money.\u201d Beyond that, he said, the bank may be following a lead, either directly or indirectly, from the United States, which has been weighing its response to Russian hacking of American computers and servers. The bank\u2019s action could be a kind of \u201cveiled sanction,\u201d he said, aimed at \u201ctrying to convey to the propaganda sources that they are increasingly finding their life difficult in the West.\u201d RT started in 2005 as Russia Today, a television network meant to sell Russia abroad through soft features. Very few watched. In 2009, it switched tracks, becoming a snarky anti-West outlet. It changed its name to RT and erased any obvious Russian link. RT portrays itself as an independent alternative voice. It trumpets the slogan \u201cQuestion More,\u201d yet generally sticks to the same major news that CNN or the BBC is covering. The difference is less in subject matter than in tenor: On RT, the West is portrayed as grim, divided, brutal, decadent, overrun with violent immigrants and unstable. The network tends to make favorable remarks about Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president; the former CNN host Larry King, who now appears on RT, scored a rare direct interview with Mr. Trump in September. In RT\u2019s coverage, Russia seems to brim with multicultural tolerance; President Vladimir V. Putin is depicted as a modernizing leader protecting Russia\u2019s sovereignty with no dreams of empire; and the enormous civilian toll in Syria represents the unfortunate many who are caught in the crossfire as the Syrian government battles terrorists. Most analysts interviewed by RT toe the line, and any who do not are rebuked. When one analyst recently said on the air that the Kremlin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea remained an issue, the questioner quickly cut her off. \u201cCrimea is off the table,\u201d he exclaimed, echoing a Putin statement. In Britain, a study by the Institute for Statecraft found that despite its claims of neutrality in the European Union referendum debate, RT gave an edge to the \u201cleave\u201d camp. Public accusations about a general Russian bias toward what is known as Brexit grew so loud that the Russian Embassy in London issued a statement saying that Moscow had no position on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union. It is unclear how many viewers RT actually reaches. Figures released by the Broadcasters Audience Research Board in Britain for the week of the Brexit vote, for example, showed that the network had 926,000 viewers in the country, or 1.57 percent of the overall audience. RT boasts that it is the \u201cmost-watched news network on YouTube\u201d with over three billion views. Millions of those hits, however, were for raw disaster footage like the 2011 Japanese tsunami that had nothing to do with RT.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T02:00:13-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/world/europe/uk-natwest-rt-russia-today.html", "item_type": "Article"}
