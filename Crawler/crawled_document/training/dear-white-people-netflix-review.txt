{"text": "Television and cinema have lately been suffering from category confusion. Films have been morphing into TV series, for better (\u201cThe Girlfriend Experience\u201d) and worse (\u201cTaken\u201d). The \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d producer David Benioff has described his show as a \u201c73-hour movie.\u201d Increasingly, the only thing that seems to distinguish the two art forms is the freedom to make your own popcorn. \u201cDear White People,\u201d based on Justin Simien\u2019s 2014 satirical sprint through the identity obstacle course of higher education, survives the transition from film intact and in some ways better. The Netflix comedy, whose 10-episode first season arrives on Friday, keeps the movie\u2019s essence but recognizes that TV is not just the movies with smaller screens and longer run times. The series retains the film\u2019s ebony-and-ivory-tower premise, a close study of students in a traditionally African-American dorm at the mostly white, Ivy League Winchester University. It has the same concerns: appropriation and assimilation, conflict and conflictedness. An executive producer of the series, Mr. Simien writes and directs three episodes \u2014 Yvette Lee Bowser (\u201cLiving Single\u201d) is the showrunner \u2014 with a mostly new (and capable) cast. The title comes from a polemical radio show on which Samantha (Logan Browning) dresses down white students; some react defensively, while others want to prove, overeagerly, that they get it. Sam\u2019s activism is partly a way to work through her biracial identity. Her romantic life echoes that: She\u2019s discreetly dating an earnest, progressive white guy, Gabe (John Patrick Amedori), but is drawn to Reggie (Marque Richardson), a firebrand black protester. The movie was audacious, irreverent and feisty, with a feel for the tripwires of a supposedly postracial era. It also sometimes felt spread thin by trying to represent a broad range of experiences. The series fleshes out its characters by using its extra time well and embracing the episodic structure of TV. Each episode, excepting the finale, focuses on a particular character. These include Troy (Brandon P Bell), son of the dean of students (Obba Babatund\u00e9), who bottles up the stress of his father\u2019s expectations; and Lionel (DeRon Horton), a gay, intellectual student journalist who\u2019s just becoming comfortable with his sexuality. This character deep-diving is a useful way to complicate first impressions. Coco (Antoinette Robertson) is at first blush Samantha\u2019s opposite \u2014 social-climbing, apolitical and concerned with fitting in among white students. But it\u2019s Coco, a scholarship student, who calls out Samantha for being oblivious to how her own \u201clight-skin privilege\u201d gives her leeway with white people: \u201cYou get away with murder,\u201d Coco says, \u201cbecause you look more like them than I do.\u201d Despite the title, \u201cDear White People\u201d is more concerned with intraracial relations: who is real enough, representative enough, woke enough. Whiteness isn\u2019t the show\u2019s subject or object so much as it\u2019s the social medium through which the characters have to wade. In a flashback, we learn that Coco and Samantha, as new friends, adopted the \u201cDear white people\u201d catchphrase as a way to talk to each other: They riff variations on it to bond, commiserate and fight. \u201cDear White People\u201d loves to riff; it\u2019s arch, playful and pop literate. The narrator (Giancarlo Esposito) announces that he was chosen for his \u201cethnic but nonthreatening voice.\u201d The students gather to hate-watch \u201cDefamation,\u201d a \u201cScandal\u201d parody, and Samantha describes her dorm as \u201clike a mini Hillman College\u201d (the historically black institution on \u201cA Different World\u201d). The rapid-fire jokes don\u2019t all land, the supporting characters can be cartoonish and the satire didactic. The show\u2019s strength is its confident, consistent voice. It also retains Mr. Simien\u2019s visual style from the film, despite having several directors. (Barry Jenkins of \u201cMoonlight\u201d directs the fifth episode, involving a police incident that hangs over the rest of the season.) One of Mr. Simien\u2019s signatures is to have actors stare into the camera directly, both in group shots and in cutaways during one-on-one conversations. The device underlines the show\u2019s mission: to intrude on your safe space, to demand engagement, to make clear that, yes \u2014 whoever you are \u2014 \u201cDear White People\u201d is talking to you.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/television/dear-white-people-netflix-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T11:12:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T11:12:54-04:00", "abstract": "This new Netflix comedy\u2019s strength is its confident, consistent voice, even though its rapid-fire jokes don\u2019t all land.", "title": "Review: \u2018Dear White People,\u2019 the TV Version, Improves on the Strong Movie"}
