His stepson Todd Dworman, who confirmed the death on Friday, said the cause was heart failure. With television\u2019s popularity soaring in the 1950s, quiz shows captivated viewers with the simple concept of watching ordinary people answer questions for cash and other prizes. On CBS, \u201cThe $64,000 Question\u201d became an immediate hit in 1955. And, the next year, on NBC, Jack Barry and Dan Enright launched \u201cTwenty-One.\u201d Mr. Freedman was happily producing \u201cTic-Tac-Dough,\u201d another Barry-Enright production, when he was asked to take over \u201cTwenty-One\u201d early in its run in 1956. He reluctantly agreed, and took on an immediate mission: find someone to defeat the show\u2019s champion, Herbert Stempel, a brainy, bespectacled young man from New York with an eidetic memory. As Mr. Stempel kept winning, Geritol, the sponsor of \u201cTwenty-One,\u201d watched his appeal \u2014 and the show\u2019s ratings \u2014 falter. It wanted new blood. At first, no potential rivals for Mr. Stempel thrilled Mr. Freedman, he told the Archive of American Television in 2000. Then, by chance, Mr. Freedman went to a party in Greenwich Village. \u201cSure enough, God listened to me, and there was this Charles Van Doren,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHe was very charming and easygoing, and I said, \u2018How would you like to appear as a contestant on my show?\u2019\u201d In an article he wrote for The New Yorker in 2008, Mr. Van Doren recounted how Mr. Freedman had persuaded him to participate by dangling the possibility of augmenting his modest teaching salary with thousands of dollars in winnings. And Mr. Freedman told him how he would help him win. \u201cJack would ask you a question you could answer and Stempel couldn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Freedman told him, referring to the host, Mr. Barry, according to Mr. Van Doren. No one else would know, the producer assured him. Not Mr. Barry, not Mr. Enright \u2014 and not the show\u2019s powerful sponsor. \u201cIn our sessions,\u201d Mr. Van Doren wrote, \u201che would ask me questions, I would answer them \u2014 and then he would tell me how to answer them: pause here; add this or that remark or aside; always seem to be worried, anxious; never answer too quickly, let the suspense build up.\u201d Mr. Freedman embraced the subterfuge because it allowed popular contestants like Mr. Van Doren \u2014 whose father, Mark Van Doren, was a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and a professor at Columbia \u2014 to return week after week and lift ratings for NBC and Geritol. \u201cI gave him the questions, and I assumed he would know how to play it,\u201d Mr. Freedman told the archive. Mr. Van Doren faced off against Mr. Stempel starting in November 1956, each standing in isolation booths that were not air-conditioned, answering questions in the quest to reach 21 points (thus the name of the show). Some games ended in ties; in one, Mr. Stempel incorrectly answered that \u201cOn the Waterfront\u201d had won the Academy Award for best picture in 1955. Mr. Stempel knew the correct answer \u2014 \u201cMarty,\u201d one of his favorite movies \u2014 but said afterward that he had been told by Mr. Enright to give the wrong one. He lost a final game, 18-10, to Mr. Van Doren, and took home $49,500. Quiz-show rigging would be exposed in investigations by the New York district attorney Frank Hogan and the House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight. The investigations formed one of the story lines in Robert Redford\u2019s 1994 film \u201cQuiz Show,\u201d which featured Hank Azaria as Mr. Freedman, John Turturro as Mr. Stempel and Ralph Fiennes as Mr. Van Doren. Mr. Freedman was indicted in 1958 for perjury, accused of lying to a grand jury when he said that he had not given questions to contestants. He later said his motivation had been to protect Mr. Van Doren. Mr. Freedman told the archive that Mr. Van Doren had told him that the truth \u201cwould destroy his father, destroy his life, and he had me promise I would not finger him.\u201d After being indicted, the jobless Mr. Freedman left for Mexico for a while. From there, he issued a statement to The New York Times, denying that quiz shows were fraudulent. They were simply \u201cshowmanship, spectacle and illusion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEveryone knows that the magician doesn\u2019t saw the lady in half,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cEven though the quiz heroes were not omniscient supermen, at least the public was able to pit its own brains against facts and knowledge they wished they had.\u201d \u201cTwenty-One\u201d was canceled in 1958 after a two-year run. Mr. Freedman recanted his testimony to another quiz-show grand jury, admitting that he had given questions in advance to contestants. The perjury charges against him were dropped, he said. Mr. Van Doren was one of 17 former contestants of \u201cTwenty-One\u201d and \u201cTic-Tac-Dough\u201d who pleaded guilty to lying to a grand jury after asserting they had received no prior help on questions and answers. They received suspended sentences. Albert Freedman \u2014 who would later add the middle name Zuro \u2014 was born March 27, 1922, in Taunton, Mass. His father, Frank, had several jobs, including baker and bottler, and his mother, the former Bessie Kanaver, was a homemaker. Mr. Freedman joined the Marines and fought in the South Pacific during World War II. He subsequently studied at the University of Southern California and at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Cin\u00e9matographiques in Paris. He found work in television, writing for Pinky Lee\u2019s variety show and Groucho Marx\u2019s \u201cYou Bet Your Life,\u201d before becoming the producer of \u201cMake Your Wish,\u201d a children\u2019s show, and later \u201cTic-Tac-Dough\u201d and \u201cTwenty-One.\u201d After the quiz-show scandal, he moved to London with his family and started writing for the European edition of the adult magazine Penthouse. Working for Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse, Mr. Freedman said, they created another magazine, Forum: The International Journal of Human Relations, which dealt with sexuality, lifestyles and relationships in often explicit terms. He also helped Mr. Guccione build his publishing company, General Media. In 1981, Mr. Freedman earned a Ph.D. from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco, writing a dissertation titled \u201cExtra-Monogamous Sex in Couple Relationships.\u201d He lectured at the institute and universities about sexuality and women\u2019s rights. In addition to Mr. Dworman, Mr. Freedman is survived by his second wife, the former Nancy Blumberg; his daughter, Tani Ruiz, and son, Derek, both from his first marriage; and two other stepchildren, Lori and Garett Dworman. Mr. Freedman\u2019s first wife, the former Esther Katz, died. Two other daughters, Mara and Lisa, also died. Mr. Freedman did not enjoy the version of the \u201cTwenty-One\u201d story told by Mr. Redford. The show the film depicted, he said, was far more fixed \u201cthan the shows I produced.\u201d", "title": "Albert Freedman, Producer of Rigged 1950s Quiz Show, Dies at 95", "item_type": "Article", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/business/media/albert-freedman-dead-quiz-show-scandal.html"}
