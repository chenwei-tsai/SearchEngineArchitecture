R. Smith and extending to the rim for a layup. It seemed simple enough. But Young, the starting power forward for the Indiana Pacers, forgot. He forgot about the best player in the world. LeBron James, who was trailing the play, began to eat up ground as he crossed midcourt, and an expectant hush fell over Bankers Life Fieldhouse. It was just a matter of watching the inevitable play out: James soaring to block Young\u2019s shot from behind, the ball landing among James\u2019s teammates on the bench, and James\u2019s momentum carrying him into the tunnel behind the basket. \u201cI was actually going to go for my little \u2018Forrest Gump\u2019 thing and just keep it moving,\u201d James said. \u201cBut there was more basketball that needed to be played.\u201d The play was reminiscent of James\u2019s chase-down block on the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of last season\u2019s N.B.A. finals, and another indication \u2014 as if anyone needed one \u2014 that Playoff LeBron is back. The Cavaliers may have had ups and downs during the regular season, but they began the playoffs with a four-game first-round sweep of the Pacers that they completed with a 106-102 victory on Sunday. Playoff LeBron collected 33 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists. Playoff LeBron shouldered the offense by attempting 25 shots, most of them layups. Playoff LeBron affixed himself to the Pacers star Paul George like a strip of Velcro, limiting him to 15 points. And Playoff LeBron made the big shot, a 3-pointer over Pacers center Myles Turner with just over a minute left. James, trying to create space against Turner, waited \u2014 waited for Turner to give him an opening. Once Turner dropped his hands, James had it. \u201cTrusted my mechanics, trusted what I\u2019m doing,\u201d said James, who, after the game, wore a sweatshirt with flames on the sleeves. \u201cIt went down.\u201d The Cavaliers, the second seed in the Eastern Conference, bought themselves some time before they face either the Toronto Raptors or the Milwaukee Bucks in a conference semifinal. Those teams are tied at two games apiece in their first-round series \u2014 and it is worth emphasizing that this is typical. These series are generally grinds. The Boston Celtics, the top seed in the East, lost the first two games of their series against the Chicago Bulls. The San Antonio Spurs, who finished the regular season with the second-best record in the league, are knotted at two games apiece with the Memphis Grizzlies out West. Even the Warriors, who are one win from sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers, are coping with adversity \u2014 their coach, Steve Kerr, is dealing with chronic back problems. Kerr told reporters on Sunday that he could miss the rest of the playoffs. James, meanwhile, has developed a habit of treating the first round like an appetizer before he digs into a playoff buffet. His teams have not lost a first-round series in 12 career playoff appearances. And his teams have won 21 straight first-round games dating to 2012. \u201cGreat coaching,\u201d Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue said, deadpan. James has been overlooked in the conversation about this season\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award. It is, in many ways, understandable. Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook, Houston\u2019s James Harden and San Antonio\u2019s Kawhi Leonard have assembled spectacular seasons. Any of them would be deserving. All James did during the regular season was score 26.4 points a game while averaging career highs in assists (8.7) and rebounds (8.6). But the Cavaliers were uneven \u2014 their defense, for much of the season, had the consistency of yogurt \u2014 and perhaps James\u2019s basketball genius feels too familiar. He has set an impossible bar for himself. Still, in the playoffs, there is no one with more command of the stage. The Pacers wilted when they had their opportunities. In Game 1, C. J. Miles misfired in the closing seconds, and the Cavaliers escaped with a 1-point win. In Game 3, the Pacers built a 26-point lead. The Cavaliers won by 5 as James had 41 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists. On Sunday, James punctuated his on-court warm-up by tossing up a series of turnaround, fadeaway jumpers from 22 feet. He wore in-ear headphones, a staple of his pregame ensemble, as Pacers fans who were courtside gawked and took photos and feared the worst. Sure enough, for the fourth time in his career, James helped eliminate the Pacers from the playoffs, even if the sweep masked what were otherwise competitive games. The Cavaliers outscored the Pacers by just 16 points over the course of the series. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating to continue losing to the same team or the same person,\u201d George said. \u201cReal frustrating.\u201d James reflected on his third-quarter block against Young \u2014 and more specifically, everything that had preceded it. James was trying to lob the ball to Kyrie Irving. But Young deflected the pass, and it caromed to Miles, who sent it back to Young, who streaked the other way. James said he could hear the voices of coaches from his childhood in his head: Don\u2019t give up on the play. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019m going to do after a turnover is just let it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I need to get back.\u201d It is that motor which drives James and drives his team. On Sunday, it moved the Cavaliers one step closer to their preferred destination.", "abstract": "Cavaliers sweep the Pacers, again, thanks to the return of the game\u2019s most dangerous player: Playoff LeBron."}
