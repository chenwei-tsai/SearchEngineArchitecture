Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief executive didn\u2019t just hit his return goal with a $1.8 billion first-quarter earnings showing. His fixed-income, currency and commodities traders virtually doubled their top line from what was a tough period for the industry last year, confirming that their chief rival made a mess of the first three months of the year. Morgan Stanley\u2019s 96 percent increase in fixed-income trading was easily the best of the batch of Wall Street\u2019s bulge-bracket results. Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase increased their comparable division\u2019s revenue just shy of a fifth, which was enough to take them back to about what they were earning in the first quarter of 2015. A 2 percent drop in the top line, though, left Goldman\u2019s traders bringing in almost half what they managed two years ago. Business mix explains part of the relative slump: Currency and commodities markets \u2014 Goldman specialties \u2014 were slow, though others only mentioned foreign exchange as problematic. But Goldman also blamed low volatility, \u201crelatively light\u201d client activity and a decline in rates and credit products. By contrast, Morgan Stanley claimed that buoyant conditions fueled its outperformance, as did JPMorgan. Fixed-income trading was not the only battlefield in which Morgan Stanley emerged victorious last quarter. Its equities traders held up better than Goldman\u2019s, registering a 2 percent decline year-over-year compared with its rival\u2019s nearly 7 percent. Mr. Gorman\u2019s teams also more than doubled underwriting revenue in equity and debt, compared with increases of 99 percent and 38 percent, respectively, at Goldman, which is led by Lloyd C. Blankfein. Morgan Stanley\u2019s vastly improved results meant the firm managed to generate an annualized return on equity of 10 percent, after stripping out a $112 million tax benefit from settling employees\u2019 share-based pay. That is on the goal Mr. Gorman has set \u2014 and leaves Goldman trailing with an annualized adjusted return on equity of just 8.9 percent. That will give shareholders yet more comfort that Mr. Gorman\u2019s strategy is finally paying off. For Mr. Blankfein, though, the questions are growing.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/dealbook/how-morgan-stanley-bested-goldman-sachs.html", "section": "Business Day", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "A near-doubling of fixed-income trading revenue in the first quarter shows that the strategy of James P.
