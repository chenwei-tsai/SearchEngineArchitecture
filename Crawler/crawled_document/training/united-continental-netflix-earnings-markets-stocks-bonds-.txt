Check below for the latest updates. Arconic, the aluminum parts maker formed out of Alcoa, said on Monday that its chairman and chief executive had resigned from the company after months of pressure from the activist hedge fund Elliott Management. In a statement, Arconic said that the decision by the executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, was made after he sent a letter to Elliott without consulting the board. Elliott directors said that the move showed poor judgment. Mr. Kleinfeld will be replaced as chief executive on an interim basis by David P. Hess, another board member. His role as chairman will be filled in the interim by the company\u2019s lead director, Patricia F. Russo. At the same time, Arconic pushed back against Elliott, saying that the hedge fund\u2019s main objective had been achieved. \u201cIt is Elliott Management\u2019s decision whether to continue to burden Arconic and its shareholders with its highly disruptive and distracting proxy fight, or to support Arconic in facilitating an effective C.E.O. search and a strong transition,\u201d the company said. \u25a0 China\u2019s growth is surging again. The country\u2019s first-quarter G.D.P. was up 6.9 percent, the most since the fall of 2015, thanks to an uptick in manufacturing. But take it with a grain of salt. As Fortune reminds us, \u201cAt least one local government has confessed to inflating G.D.P. figures for years.\u201d \u25a0 Markets in the United States open on Monday after a long weekend. Global markets are mostly down, possibly the result of the increased tensions around North Korea. \u25a0 United Continental Holdings reports quarterly earnings on Monday. Fallout from the company\u2019s recent public relations disaster will not show up in quarter, which analysts expect will be strong, but all eyes will still be on Oscar Munoz, the chief executive of United Airlines. \u25a0 Netflix also reports earnings on Monday. The company\u2019s stock is trading near a record high, and coming off a string of strong quarters as more customers sign up for its streaming media service. But Netflix shares have a habit of big moves up \u2014 and down \u2014 on the heels of quarterly earnings."}
