Her \u201cCollected Stories\u201d should be on the shelf of any serious fan of the form. A new anthology, \u201cA Grace Paley Reader,\u201d contains some of those stories, a selection of poems and several essays that show a different side of the writer. Paley, raised by two socialist parents in the Bronx, was always politically active. She once said that raising children and staying engaged in politics were two of the factors that limited her fiction output. (\u201cArt is too long, and life is too short.\u201d) Her essays won\u2019t be mistaken for classics, and in fairness they don\u2019t read as though she intended them to be. They\u2019re partisan dispatches from a certain moment in time, one that echoes our own. She writes about her own experience with abortion and her view of sexual politics; about spending a few days in jail for protesting the Vietnam War (\u201cI slept well for some reason, probably the hard mattress. I don\u2019t seem to mind where I am\u201d); about the Persian Gulf war of 1991; and about the global struggle for women\u2019s rights (\u201cWe are in the hands of men whose power and wealth have separated them from the reality of daily life and from the imagination. We are right to be afraid\u201d). George Saunders provides a wonderful introduction, in which he describes what he finds so brilliant about Paley\u2019s voice, especially in the fiction. \u201cPaley is, for me, a kind of secular saint,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhat is a saint? Someone particularly attentive to things as they are and extraordinarily accepting of them. Paley honors every person and thing she creates by presenting them at their best, or at least their liveliest \u2014 which may be the same thing.\u201d Quotable \u201cI never got that sort of strange Hemingway-like fascination with the kinetics of war. I was mostly interested in its effects on the losing side, the way that it moved the losing side backward in time.\u201d \u2014 Omar El Akkad, author of \u201cAmerican War,\u201d on his time as a reporter in Afghanistan, in an interview with BookPage A Graphic Look at Torture The full report from the Senate Intelligence Committee about the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s torture of captured terrorism suspects, released in 2014, ran to more than 6,000 pages. Even its streamlined summary took up 525. \u201cThe Torture Report: A Graphic Adaptation,\u201d by Sid Jacobson and Ernie Col\u00f3n, distills the information therein to 113 pages of illustrated summary. (The authors previously released a similar, best-selling treatment of the 9/11 Commission\u2019s findings.) \u201cShocking though it was in the 21st century,\u201d Jane Mayer writes in an introduction to the new book, \u201cthe issue of torture became just one more political football\u201d after the Senate issued its conclusions. \u201cSome of the material is graphic, but this makes it a perfect subject for graphic depiction.\u201d", "title": "Selections From a \u2018Saint\u2019", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T17:47:42-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/books/review/grace-paley-reader.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00"}
