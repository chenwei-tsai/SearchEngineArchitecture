{"abstract": "The avant-garde vocalist looks back at her nearly 40-year career as she releases two new albums.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "Diamanda Gal\u00e1s sings the demonic blues. And she\u2019s sung them again and again. \u201cPeople say all I do is repeat myself,\u201d she said in a recent phone conversation. \u201cBut I have certain ideas that fascinate me.\u201d For nearly 40 years, Ms. Gal\u00e1s, 61, has bared those ideas \u2014 society\u2019s indifference to the sick, sexual violence, genocide, mental illness, incarceration, loneliness \u2014 with a voice that stretches from hostile growls to bitter-cold shrieks. She rose to prominence in the 1980s as a kind of avant-garde angel of the AIDS epidemic. Joining the activists of Act Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, she created a series of rancorous indictments of the political, medical and religious establishment \u2014 hissing, rasping, wailing evening-length performances with titles like \u201cPlague Mass\u201d and \u201cMasque of the Red Death.\u201d In 1985, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times that Ms. Gal\u00e1s \u201csuggests an entranced Medusa, conjuring avenging spirits out of the darkness.\u201d As her work has taken in collaborations with John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, explorations of sensory deprivation and a book of her texts with a title both unprintable and blasphemous, that description has remained remarkably, consistently on point. It holds true in her two most recent albums, released simultaneously last month: \u201cAll the Way,\u201d a gloomy compilation of jazz covers and standards, and \u201cAt Saint Thomas the Apostle Harlem,\u201d which captures a 2016 New York performance of what she has called \u201cdeath songs.\u201d At first she was resistant to the idea of revisiting eight central tracks from a career spent both stubbornly fixated and constantly looking forward. \u201cOnce it\u2019s recorded, it\u2019s gone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mind fills up with new ideas. Life is short.\u201d But in the end, she required little prompting to talk about her music and its meanings. Growing up with a musician father, Ms. Gal\u00e1s played the piano in bands, but eventually longed to be a frontwoman. \u201cI want to just go into a dark room where no one can hear me,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand use my voice to express whatever I\u2019m thinking and feeling in that moment, uncensored by the demands of music \u2014 jazz, classical, anything.\u201d Her first album, recorded in a chilly basement in England, was an explosion of screeches and moans. But the title, she insists, had nothing to do with devil worship: \u201cThe work is not a paean to Satan. It\u2019s about a prince of exile, it\u2019s someone who\u2019s been cast from society. The idea of someone being completely cast from society and surviving, and somehow managing to make it through every wretched day.\u201d \u201cThe Litanies of Satan\u201d was made just before the AIDS epidemic, which claimed Ms. Gal\u00e1s\u2019s brother and dominated years of her work. She became involved in Act Up and wrote \u201cMasque of the Red Death,\u201d a ferocious attack on the lack of concern about the disease and its victims, which premiered at Lincoln Center in 1989. In \u201cPlague Mass,\u201d recorded live during performances at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York in 1990, she repurposed her sepulchral, severe version of this spiritual as the closing number. It was already a Gal\u00e1s signature, a highlight of her previous album, which also had a Satan-tinged title: \u201cBy that time, 1988, \u2018You Must Be Certain of the Devil,\u2019 there was no metaphor any more,\u201d she said. \u201cThat album was an AIDS album.\u201d \u201cAnd after that,\u201d she said, \u201cwas \u2018Vena Cava,\u2019 about the concatenation of AIDS dementia and clinical depression and that they were often inseparable. Or couldn\u2019t be told apart by doctors or people who visited. And combined into terrifying mental states.\u201d With faint sounds audible in the background, Ms. Gal\u00e1s\u2019s voice is sometimes choked and hyperventilating, sometimes whispery and obsessive. \u201cNursie, nursie,\u201d she repeats at one point, and later the numbers \u201c6-7-8,\u201d over and over. Her collaboration with Mr. Jones, a longtime admirer, took the form of a raucous album of songs fantasizing about taking sadistic vengeance on wayward men. This cover of a 1960s soul classic is from a favored Gal\u00e1s genre: desperate love ballads. \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those songs,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere you go to the wrong place. Where you know the ending\u2019s going to be bad, so what the hell.\u201d \u201c\u2018Shrei\u2019 is a torture piece about a person with no possibility of escape,\u201d said Ms. Gal\u00e1s, who has performed it in the dark, in quadraphonic sound. The sonic landscape is spare and creepy; her voice, serrated and throaty. (It sounds, it must be said, a little like Gollum.) Finally, she hisses: \u201cIt\u2019s the smell of death.\u201d Ms. Gal\u00e1s returned to recording for the first time in five years with a twofer: \u201cLa Serpenta Canta\u201d \u2014 joyfully earthy covers of blues, soul, and country standards \u2014 and \u201cDefixiones, Will and Testament.\u201d A crushing memorial to the Armenian, Assyrian and Anatolian Greek genocides carried out by Turkey from 1914 to 1923, \u201cDefixiones\u201d refers to the messages engraved in lead that relatives placed on the graves of those who had been killed. Amid a roiling backdrop \u2014 a woman is faintly speaking, electronics are howling, a piano is pounding \u2014 Ms. Gal\u00e1s savagely shouts, as if she\u2019s the star of a political rally, one of the last poems that Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote before his murder. This is a personal one: \u201cWhen I first heard it,\u201d Ms. Gal\u00e1s said, \u201cI was ending some kind of love affair, and so there it was, the death knell.\u201d Her take on the standard \u2014 keening, creaking, swooping \u2014 takes its inspiration more from Chet Baker\u2019s glacially desolate take than B. B. King\u2019s livelier hit version. On \u201cAll the Way,\u201d she said, she was drawn to love songs \u2014 \u201cthese pernicious songs,\u201d she called them \u2014 that, like \u201cThe Dark End of the Street,\u201d are less celebratory than masochistic. \u201c\u2018All the Way\u2019 is not an optimistic anthem,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018All the Way\u2019 means all or nothing. And also \u2018You Don\u2019t Know What Love Is\u2019: These are almost suicidal anthems. They\u2019re the willingness to go to a dangerous place again.\u201d Her vocalism is no less extreme on these two new albums, but there\u2019s often a more low-slung, more relaxed quality about them, particularly in this leisurely yet taut take on the old folk song: churning piano, a coppery howl, an eerie, baby-like babble. \u201c\u2018O Death\u2019 is a love song as well,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018O Death\u2019 is saying how sweet your body begins to smell to me as your organs begin to shut down, you who are becoming old, old, old. And there it is: It\u2019s out of control.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/arts/music/diamanda-galas-key-tracks.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T15:15:39-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Diamanda Gal\u00e1s Delves Into Darkness, Revisiting 8 Haunting Tracks", "created_date": "2017-04-18T15:15:39-04:00", "section": "Arts"}
