{"text": "The Mets\u2019 first month of the season has been defined by underachievement and injuries, and there was more of the same on Thursday when the seemingly indomitable Noah Syndergaard \u2014 he of the sizzling fastballs \u2014 was scratched from his scheduled afternoon start against the Atlanta Braves at Citi Field. The problem \u2014 no surprise \u2014 was with his pitching arm. Mets Manager Terry Collins said that Syndergaard had \u201ca little bit of a tired arm\u201d that had likely led to some tendinitis in his right biceps. As a result, Collins pitched Matt Harvey in Syndergaard\u2019s place. However, when it was Syndergaard\u2019s turn to speak with reporters after Collins was done, he mentioned discomfort in his shoulder as well. Either way, none of it was good news for a Mets team that was already missing two starters \u2014 Steven Matz and Seth Lugo \u2014 neither of whom is likely to return soon as they deal with their own arm issues. Syndergaard\u2019s most recent start came last Thursday against Philadelphia, when he pitched seven innings and struck out 10 batters in a game the Mets lost. He said he first felt the irritation earlier this week during his normal throwing between starts but was able to finish his workout. He said he then took anti-inflammatory medication and felt better. On Wednesday, however, after playing catch, Syndergaard said his pitching arm again stiffened up as the temperature dropped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really lift my arm above my shoulder at that point,\u201d he said. Syndergaard took another anti-inflammatory Wednesday and said he felt \u201creally good\u201d Thursday morning, but that the Mets decided to sit him as a precautionary measure. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a little thing right now but I definitely don\u2019t want it to become a big thing,\u201d Syndergaard said, later adding: \u201cIt\u2019s just a little discomfort, irritation, nothing too serious.\u201d When asked where in the arm he felt the discomfort, Syndergaard mentioned his shoulder and biceps, without clarifying the exact location. Later though, Syndergaard dismissed the notion that the pain was related to an elbow spur he had last June, saying, \u201cthis is shoulder.\u201d Syndergaard is widely viewed as the ace of the Mets\u2019 staff, which is filled with young, talented pitchers who keep encountering physical problems. In fact, Syndergaard was the only one of those pitchers to make it all the way through 2016 without being sidelined. Harvey was one of those pitchers who did go down, missing much of last season after undergoing surgery to treat thoracic outlet syndrome. This year, he has been healthy. Last Friday, Harvey filled in for Jacob deGrom, who missed a scheduled start with a stiff neck. And on Thursday, he became the emergency substitue again. Syndergaard said he hoped he would be able to pitch Sunday in Washington against a Nationals team that is already pulling away from the Mets in the National League East. Collins announced that deGrom and Zach Wheeler would pitch the first two games of that series.
