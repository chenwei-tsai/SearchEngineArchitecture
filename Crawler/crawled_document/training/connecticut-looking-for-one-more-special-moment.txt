{"text": "On the eve of the women\u2019s Final Four, Connecticut\u2019s Geno Auriemma was paid what sounded like the highest compliment a coach could receive from a peer and an opponent. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest: If I were to watch a basketball game, I\u2019ve told people, I would rather watch UConn than anybody \u2014 men or women,\u201d the Oregon State women\u2019s basketball coach, Scott Rueck, said. \u201cThe way they transition, the way they share the basketball, the way they defend \u2014 I think they set a high bar in every way.\u201d Granted, this subjective testimonial came from a coach on Auriemma\u2019s side of the gender debate and who became the semifinal victim of Auriemma and unbeaten Connecticut the next day. That set up Tuesday night\u2019s national championship grand finale \u2014 an 82-51 Huskies rout of the would-be anarchists from Syracuse. Rueck also weighed in before Villanova stunned North Carolina at the buzzer in the men\u2019s title game Monday night, a classic final sure to raise the testosterone levels in those who have asserted that the women\u2019s game for too long has been Connecticut and a whole lot of teams merely fulfilling the statistical mandates of Title IX. But read what Rueck said closely, and ask yourself about whom you have heard that before. On the N.B.A. level, that would be Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs, who since the late 1990s and through five championships have been deified for sharing, transitioning, defending \u2014 completing the checklist of team-first categories that make the basketball purists want to kneel at the River Walk altar. That said, within evolutionary boundaries, even Phil Jackson may at this point be willing to concede that there always will and must be challenges to the establishment status quo, the notions of what is the so-called right, or most effective, way to play. Given Tuesday night\u2019s stakes, altering stylistic perceptions was secondary to the nothing-to-lose ambitions of Syracuse and its 10th-year coach, Quentin Hillsman, in presenting the challenge of his caution-to-the-wind team to Connecticut and the North Syracuse home girl Breanna Stewart, going for a Division I women\u2019s record fourth consecutive national title. After Syracuse improved on its season-long 29.8 3-point shooting percentage by making 26 of 63 (almost 40 percent) in its two previous tournament games, against Tennessee and Washington, there was a touch of Spurs-Golden State Warriors in the pregame air, with Syracuse\u2019s multifaceted point guard, Alexis Peterson, and the shoot-it-from-anywhere Brianna Butler in the roles of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. That notion was fun and also a fantasy, as the Huskies \u2014 toying with Syracuse\u2019s defensive pressure and tormenting them with pressure perimeter face guarding \u2014 opened the game on a 9-0 run and led by 28-13 after the first quarter. By halftime, Connecticut\u2019s Big 3 of Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck had outscored Syracuse, 38 (of 50) to 23. Brian Stewart, Breanna\u2019s father, had noticed something about Hillsman\u2019s team when he took a short ride from his home to watch the Orange play in Syracuse during the tournament\u2019s first weekend (after which they went to Sioux Falls, S.D., and knocked off the region\u2019s top seed, South Carolina). \u201cThey\u2019re hot, they\u2019ve got momentum, and the great thing about Syracuse that you can see is that they are having fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s dangerous, and that\u2019s cool.\u201d Cool only in a sense that his daughter, the best player in the college game for three years running, grew up with emotional ties to the Syracuse program and its coaches; became close friends while playing club ball with one of Hillsman\u2019s core players, the Newark native Brittney Sykes; and might have wound up a mayoral candidate had she remained in Syracuse and won even one national title for the home team. She would have stayed, Auriemma argued, \u201cif she was a guy playing high school ball there.\u201d Stewart instead paid a couple of visits to Storrs, Conn., from which Auriemma does not have to explain or much sell his program and certainly does not have to grovel to anyone. He recently said his \u201cheart goes out\u201d to coaches \u201cwhen you have to, like, embarrass yourself to get a kid.\u201d He continued, with some hesitation, \u201cThe stories I hear make me want to \u2014 about what some of these kids put coaches through during the recruiting process.\u201d That has been the upside for Auriemma, who claimed his 11th (slide over on that pedestal, Zen Master Jackson) national title, or one more than John Wooden earned at U.C.L.A. in setting the men\u2019s record. Most basketball people \u2014 even those wrongheadedly claiming Connecticut\u2019s dominance has hurt the women\u2019s game \u2014 would have to admit after the Huskies\u2019 clinical domination of a Syracuse team still feisty enough to drop a 16-0 third-quarter run on the Huskies that Auriemma\u2019s teams are exceedingly well coached and poised. But it\u2019s also true that his current UConn edition could have the first three players chosen in the W.N.B.A. draft in Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, which is why Auriemma must occasionally lecture those who think losing only five games over the last four years has been achieved with ease. Not the point, said Brian Stewart, a Syracuse fan and Y.M.C.A. gym rat long before his long-limbed daughter began stretching to 6 feet 4. \u201cHow many teams with other players that good could handle having a Breanna Stewart on their team, getting so much attention, and never have to deal with any animosity?\u201d he said. If you ask to interview Brian Stewart, his wife, Heather, is invariably present to weigh in as well. \u201cThey get great players, but they don\u2019t get all the great players,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what they do with those players and personalities to work together.\u201d As the mother of the Final Four\u2019s four-time most outstanding player, she said that was what she would most miss \u2014 the togetherness, the teamwork \u2014 about the college game as Breanna embarked on her professional and, in all likelihood, Olympic careers. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking every moment slowly, to absorb and appreciate it all,\u201d Heather Stewart said. That the last game was against Syracuse \u2014 and what were those odds, she asked in the run up to the final? \u2014 made it feel that much more of a storybook ending after a four-year odyssey. Twenty-four N.C.A.A. tournament games played, 24 won.
