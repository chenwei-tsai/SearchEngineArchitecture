One of the highlights of the season, which was announced Wednesday, will be a staging of Hans Zender\u2019s orchestration of Schubert\u2019s \u201cWinterreise,\u201d sung by the tenor Ian Bostridge, played by the International Contemporary Ensemble and directed by Netia Jones. The Weimar-inspired staging, which will be performed Aug. 12 and 13 at the Rose Theater, comes as the Zender version, with its touches of Kurt Weill and Mahler, is back in vogue: Simon Rattle conducted it at Carnegie Hall in October. Other Schubert offerings this summer are to include the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra performing his Symphony No. 9, under the baton of Gianandrea Noseda, and Symphony No. 5, conducted by Edward Gardner; a performance of his Piano Trio in B-flat major by Trio Solisti; and a free \u201cSchubertiade Remix\u201d by Rick Burkhardt, Alec Duffy and David Malloy (who created the theater piece \u201cThree Pianos\u201d) and the International Contemporary Ensemble. The festival, which runs from July 25 through Aug. 20, will feature performances by artists and ensembles including Joshua Bell, Jeremy Denk, Steven Isserlis, Gil Shaham, the Danish String Quartet, Les Arts Florissants, Kirill Gerstein and So Percussion. There will, of course, be plenty of Mozart this year, as well \u2014 including the return of the Budapest Festival Orchestra\u2019s innovative production of Mozart\u2019s \u201cDon Giovanni,\u201d which will be both conducted and directed by Ivan Fischer. And the festival\u2019s music director, Louis Langr\u00e9e, has extended his contract for three more years, through the 2020 season.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/arts/music/mostly-mozart-festival-with-a-side-of-schubert.html", "section": "Arts", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "Lincoln Center\u2019s Mostly Mozart Festival will include a staged version of Hans Zender\u2019s orchestration of Schubert\u2019s \u201cWinterreise.\u201d", "title": "This Summer Brings Mostly Mozart, With a Side of Schubert", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T12:00:15-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
