{"text": "At the outset of the N.B.A. finals, Adam Silver, the league\u2019s commissioner, paid tribute to Stephen Curry by comparing him to, of all people, Roger Bannister. What Bannister was to track, Silver believed, Curry had become to professional basketball: a barrier crasher and culture changer who is reconfiguring the basketball court\u2019s scoring contours. Silver chose Bannister as his example because his running of the first sub-four-minute mile, in 1954, \u201cwasn\u2019t something that then nobody touched for 20 years.\u201d After Bannister, running a sub-four-minute mile at the high end of the sport became a common occurrence. Of Curry, as well as Klay Thompson, Silver said, \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing when it comes to 3-point shooting, they\u2019ve overcome a psychological barrier, I think, for a lot of players who just never thought the kind of shots they would make were possible.\u201d Magnificent performances by LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, along with the suspension of Draymond Green, lifted the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 112-97 victory in Game 5 on Monday night at Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif., at least delaying Curry and the Golden State Warriors from clinching their second straight N.B.A. title. But Silver had left no doubt, whatever the postseason\u2019s outcome, that he believed Curry, especially, and Thompson had already altered \u201cthe whole dynamic of our game.\u201d Use of the 3-point shot has been drastically rising for years. But the question \u2014 invariably asked by basketball purists and by those wondering if Curry is a unique talent or a new paradigm in the approach to offense \u2014 is this: Is it for better, or for worse? Is the sport enhanced or debased when the possibility of a successful layup or a dunk is skirted for a 3-point attempt by a player who might be converting roughly three in 10? (Iman Shumpert made such a decision with James leading a fast break in Game 4 before James\u2019s pass to him in the left corner went awry.) In December, Mark Jackson, a network analyst and former Warriors coach, raised this issue, largely to a chorus of jeers from those who thought his takeaway comment \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s hurting the game\u201d \u2014 was specious criticism of Curry. It wasn\u2019t. Jackson also said Curry was the league\u2019s most valuable player and a champion because he was \u201ca complete player.\u201d He was lamenting the imitative effect: high school players everywhere pulling up from behind the 3-point line, thinking they can be him. \u201cYou are not Steph Curry,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWork on other aspects of the game.\u201d We took Jackson\u2019s argument to two coaches of successful public school teams: Steve Finamore of East Lansing High School in Michigan and Ron Naclerio of Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Queens. While Naclerio, after 35 years of high-level scholastic coaching, leaned old-school, Finamore nixed the notion that the game was in danger of turning into a 3-point-shooting, bricklaying circus. \u201cI totally disagree with that quote from Mark Jackson,\u201d he said. Finamore has been at East Lansing for six seasons, the most recent concluding with a 23-1 record. He formerly worked on Coach Tom Izzo\u2019s staff at Michigan State, where he developed a working relationship with Green. Knowing his players are watching the N.B.A. closely, Finamore admitted that the games occasionally had their wince-inducing moments \u2014 J. R. Smith\u2019s backing up behind the 3-point line and shooting an air ball in Game 4 came immediately to mind. \u201cAnd Steph at times does take what we would consider to be bad shots,\u201d Finamore said. \u201cBut he has actually influenced the way we play. We run a high-powered offense, look for the 3-point shot, even from way back, if they can make them. We encourage our kids to take them, practice them, and I use a lot from Steph \u2014 mostly quotes about how hard he\u2019s worked at it \u2014 with my guys.\u201d The sport, Finamore argued, is not trending as much as it is evolving, de-emphasizing traditional low post play, even slashing on the break in favor of finding the 3-point line. Pete Newell, who ran a longtime summer camp for big men, focusing on footwork and post moves, \u201cmust be rolling over in his grave,\u201d Finamore said. \u201cWe have a sophomore, 6-foot-8, going to be a Division I player, with the body type of a Klay Thompson. People ask why I don\u2019t put him in the post. I tell them because that\u2019s not his game and that\u2019s not where the game is going.\u201d Like Finamore, Naclerio said he had players who were red-lighted on shooting the 3 until they put the work in to demonstrate a reasonable proficiency. Unlike Finamore, he had more reservations about predicating a high school offense on the long ball. \u201cI still think the high school game is won by getting layups,\u201d he said. He sounded leery about relying too much on 3-point shots. \u201cOn good days, the best high school players make a decent amount. On bad days, they miss most of them. \u201cAnd when I see kids just flinging them up from deep in a game or just practicing, it\u2019s scary. I tell them, the pro game shot is a lot longer than the high school game. It\u2019s a whole different world.\u201d Naclerio also agreed with Jackson that Curry might be a historic exception more than the eventual rule. \u201cWhen you say that there are going to be a lot more guys like Curry, how many have ever had the handle that he has?\u201d he said. \u201cHow many can create space off the dribble and shoot like that or come off the screen and get it up that quickly? And that\u2019s without a high release point.\u201d But Naclerio ultimately applauded Curry and the Warriors, citing them as role models, as practitioners of a team-oriented style worth watching and, yes, emulating. \u201cThey\u2019re not just running a high screen and shooting the ball,\u201d he said. \u201cCurry\u2019s not just standing in the corner. Golden State is getting their 3s in motion, with five guys working together, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s really hard to guard. They play the right way.\u201d In essence, Naclerio was saying that judgment on Curry and the Warriors\u2019 legacy should be focused as much on how they have achieved as much as on what they\u2019ve achieved. Naclerio, who began coaching before there was a 3-point shot, admitted that his offense next season at Cardozo \u2014 his team just graduated three Division I players \u2014 would feature a penetrating point guard and two \u201creally good sophomore shooters\u201d spreading the floor, looking for the 3. Consider the Cardozo barrier crashed. \u201cThe game is changing,\u201d Naclerio said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m changing with it.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/sports/basketball/is-stephen-curry-the-future-or-just-an-exception.html", "published_date": "2016-06-12T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T02:00:11-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T02:00:11-04:00", "abstract": "Purists are left to wonder if the Warriors guard is a unique talent, or a model for future N.B.A. offenses.", "title": "Is Stephen Curry Changing Basketball, or Just Owning It?"}
