The result was a full-throated rebuke of France\u2019s traditional mainstream parties, setting the country on an uncertain path at a critical moment when France\u2019s election could also decide the future of the European Union. The two candidates appeared to be headed to a runoff on May 7. Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, abandoned traditional parties a year ago to form his own movement with an eclectic blend of left and right views. He campaigned on a pro-European Union platform, coupled with calls to overhaul the rules governing the French economy. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s success is a victory for skeptics who oppose the European Union and for those who want to see more \u201cFrance First\u201d policies to restrict signs of Muslim faith in public, like the wearing of head scarves. \u201cThe great debate will finally take place,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said on Twitter. \u201cFrench citizens need to seize this historic opportunity.\u201d Ms. Le Pen spoke later to her cheering supporters in the small town of H\u00e9nin-Beaumont in northern France, and although the final results were unclear she could claim a victory of sorts. Not only will she be in the runoff for the first time, but she also got a higher percentage of votes than she did in 2012, and a higher percentage than her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, did in 2002, when he made it to the second round as the National Front candidate. She called the outcome as \u201can act of French pride, that of a people who are raising up their heads, that of a people sure of their values and confident of the future.\u201d Few analysts give her much of a chance of winning in the second round, however. Even before official results were announced, the political establishment was rallying behind Mr. Macron, warning of the dangers of a victory by the National Front, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s far-right party. Bernard Cazeneuve, the sitting Socialist prime minister, called Ms. Le Pen\u2019s project \u201cdangerous and sectarian\u201d and said it would \u201cimpoverish, isolate and divide\u201d the country. \u201cIt will inevitably lead to the end of Europe and of the euro, and, eventually, to France\u2019s relegation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe National Front cannot be the future of our country.\u201d For now, voters narrowly embraced Mr. Macron\u2019s centrist calls for change over more strident appeals from the far left and the far right for France to fortify itself against immigration and globalization. His success also suggests that despite multiple terrorist attacks in France recently, a message of outreach to immigrants and an acceptance of Muslims as well as of ethnic diversity have some currency. Ms. Le Pen campaigned stridently against Muslim immigration, linking it to security threats. The results showed that France remains deeply divided. Four candidates of markedly different views came within a few points of one another in the vote on Sunday, suggesting that the fight is far from over about what vision of France will dominate the future. The far-left candidate, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, refused to accept early projections that indicated his defeat. But the mainstream right candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, conceded, saying that he had failed to \u201cconvince\u201d the French. \u201cThe obstacles put on my path were too numerous, too cruel,\u201d he said, obliquely referring to embezzlement scandals that swirled around his campaign."}
