That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. I wrote about Jamie Oliver for the Eat column in The New York Times Magazine this week, and we published his recipe for chicken in milk to go with it. I hope you\u2019ll read the column, then cook the recipe for dinner tonight. Jamie\u2019s a good interview, and the chicken makes for astonishingly good eating. Make our version for the dish, by the way. Don\u2019t follow the recipe you found on Pinterest or a blog somewhere. Too many adaptations of chicken in milk, including on Jamie\u2019s own site, omit the enormous amount of butter he calls for using at the start. (Don\u2019t worry! You discard the bulk of it before setting the dish in the oven.) That step appears in the recipe he originally published in his 2002 cookbook, \u201cHappy Days With the Naked Chef.\u201d I talked to Jamie about that. (He\u2019s Jamie to me.) \u201cIt\u2019s definitely better with butter, 100 percent,\u201d he said. I told him about the adaptation on his site, just olive oil, no butter. \u201cStrange,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll find that person and cook them in milk!\u201d So that\u2019s Sunday. Monday night, give David Tanis\u2019s recipe for Spanish asparagus revuelto a spin. It\u2019s one of those breakfast-for-dinner winners that you may come back to more than a few times this spring. (Or, you know, just make instant ramen and watch CNN. But make it perfect instant ramen if you do.) For Tuesday, let\u2019s try David\u2019s recipe for spicy Thai pork tenderloin salad. And follow it up the next night with Melissa\u2019s dead simple recipe for sheet-pan chicken, a classic of the one-pan dinner oeuvre. Which brings us to Thursday and its alliterative tendency to tacos: perhaps in the form of these lovely blackened-fish tacos, or tacos with black beans and poblanos. Or, if you\u2019re jammed for time, grab a roast chicken from a hot-bulb place, shred it, douse with lime and hot sauce and taco away. It\u2019s a Thursday night, and you\u2019ve been cooking hard for four days straight. (Unless you made the ramen one night, in which case, cook!) And then you can round out the week with a classic old Moira Hodgson recipe for grilled salmon with lemon-herb marinade. We published it in 1996 and revisited it in your name. It\u2019s legit remarkable. I think you will like. You can find thousands of others recipes to cook this week on Cooking. Go search among them and save the ones you like to your recipe box, so you can find them easily when you\u2019re ready to cook. You can, in fact, save recipes from anywhere on the web to your Cooking recipe box. Here\u2019s how to do that. Put stars on the recipes when you\u2019re done cooking and leave notes if you\u2019ve come up with a smart ingredient substitution or cooking hack. And, if you run into a jam with the technology or your kitchen work, do write for help. We monitor cookingcare@nytimes.com as if we are Houston and you are on Apollo 13. Now, what are you reading these days? I\u2019m primed for Omar El Akkad\u2019s first novel, \u201cAmerican War.\u201d (Here\u2019s Michiko Kakutani\u2019s review in The Times.) He\u2019s not for everyone, but I stand strong for Randy Wayne White and his Doc Ford tales of southwest Florida: Here\u2019s his new \u201cMangrove Lightning.\u201d (And here\u2019s a meal to go with it: Yucat\u00e1n shrimp, a dish I learned to make at White\u2019s restaurant on Sanibel Island.) And if the great Norman Rush is writing about the great Teju Cole, \u201cA Burning Collection,\u201d for The New York Review of Books? You should read that, too, and seek out both their works, right away. Have a great week."}
