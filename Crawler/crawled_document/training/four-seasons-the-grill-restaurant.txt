For the time being, forget about any lunch at all in the rooms that used to house the Four Seasons. When the Grill, the first of two new restaurants in the Seagram Building space, opens to the public on May 2, it will serve only dinner. Jeff Zalaznick, a partner in Major Food Group, which now runs the restaurant complex, said the group wants the restaurant to make its mark as a destination for dinner. (Lunch will be added in about two months.) And though the partners spoke at one point about resurrecting dishes from the Four Seasons\u2019 past, the menu will be entirely new. Major Food, with the blessing of Aby Rosen, the building\u2019s owner and a partner in the restaurant, is wiping the slate clean. The Grill, on the second level, aims instead to channel the spirit of 1958, when the bronze Mies van der Rohe tower opened. (The Four Seasons, a celebrity magnet, followed in 1959 and closed last July; its owners plan to reopen a few blocks away.) \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a classic midcentury chophouse,\u201d Mr. Zalaznick said. \u201cWe\u2019re really into the history of dining in New York in that era.\u201d He mentioned Jack Dempsey\u2019s and Christ Cella as examples. Hanging in the travertine lobby on the ground floor are works by Joan Mir\u00f3, Cy Twombly and others, all dating from 1958. (There are also a few paintings in the private dining rooms.) The menu by Mario Carbone, the chef and a partner in Major Food, features dishes from that era, like steak tartare, scallops in snail butter, mock turtle soup, avocado crab Louis and lobster Newburg. It also includes honey-mustard duckling, filet mignon any of three ways (including with oysters), and Dover sole finished tableside like a number of other dishes, including the spit-roasted prime rib roast with deviled bones, carved on a silver trolley. A signature Four Seasons dish was the crab cake; the Grill\u2019s is called the Seagram crab cake. \u201cIt\u2019s all crab meat, no filler,\u201d Mr. Zalaznick said. A sumptuous buffet at the top of the stairs, presided over by a chef, will dispense cold dishes for the table, like cured salmon and assorted hams, crudit\u00e9s and terrines. Also on display will be floral arrangements, platters of food and cakes. The room has been restored, polished and fitted with thick oxblood carpet, leather Knoll chairs and new banquettes. The balcony, once a Siberia for diners without boldfaced names, could become a desired location; tables for six are fitted with imposing plush Burgundy banquettes and offer a sweeping view of the dining room. The host stand has been relocated to the street-level lobby, where guests can check in for the Grill and, in about three months, the Pool, a seafood restaurant with its own bar and lounge run by the chef Rich Torrisi, another Major Food partner. The dining rooms\u2019 landmark protections prohibited any structural changes and even most cosmetic ones. But the kitchen was fair game and has been completely redone, more open yet divided in two to meet the needs of each restaurant. The Grill, 99 East 52nd Street, 212-375-9003, thegrillnewyork.com.
