{"abstract": "The sports association\u2019s action follows the state\u2019s decision to repeal a law that many had viewed as anti-gay.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "The N.C.A.A. on Tuesday included several cities in North Carolina among numerous future sites of its championship events through 2022, in sports from basketball to field hockey and in all three competitive divisions, solidifying the association\u2019s decision earlier this month to return to the state after its government repealed a controversial law many viewed as anti-gay. The Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament will return to Greensboro, a stalwart for March play, in 2020. This year, early-round games that turned out to feature teams like North Carolina and Duke were moved to Greenville, S.C. Other future host cities in the Tar Heel State include Raleigh (Division I men\u2019s basketball games in 2021), Winston-Salem (Division I field hockey games in 2019) and Cary (the next five Division II baseball championships and the men\u2019s soccer final fours in 2019 and 2021). The N.C.A.A., college sports\u2019 national governing body, also restored first- and second-round games in next year\u2019s men\u2019s basketball tournament to Charlotte. \u201cThe site selections follow the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors\u2019 vote to allow consideration of championship bids in North Carolina,\u201d the association said in a statement. The N.C.A.A. made waves last year when it followed the N.B.A., which had withdrawn its All-Star Game from Charlotte, and canceled championship events in North Carolina after the passage of the controversial law. Known as House Bill 2, or H.B. 2, the so-called bathroom bill eliminated local anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and mandated that transgender people use bathrooms in public facilities that corresponded with their birth-assigned sex. At the time, the N.C.A.A. said that it moved the events \u201cto assure a safe, healthy, discrimination-free atmosphere.\u201d That law was repealed last month, on the eve of what was widely seen as a deadline imposed by the N.C.A.A. in a state in which college sports are culturally vital and economically powerful. A week later, the N.C.A.A. \u201creluctantly\u201d announced that it would again consider placing events in the state. The tortured language in the N.C.A.A.\u2019s announcement (and some of the criticism that ensued) stemmed from the ambiguous nature of the repeal, which barred local ordinances on the topic for several years and left decisions about bathrooms up to the state legislature. The N.C.A.A. still requires host sites to fill out a questionnaire detailing any obstacles to nondiscrimination that might affect athletes or fans. The Atlantic Coast Conference, which has several member colleges in the state and is itself based there, and which moved its neutral-site championships this academic year out of the state in response to the law, announced days after the repeal that it would again consider the state for events.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-restores-championship-events-to-north-carolina.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T14:01:06-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "N.C.A.A.
