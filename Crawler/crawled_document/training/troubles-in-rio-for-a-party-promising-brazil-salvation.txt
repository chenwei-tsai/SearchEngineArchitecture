Grenade blasts from drug-gang battles echo through Leblon, the seaside bastion of the city\u2019s elite. Even the governor\u2019s daughter was recently mugged at gunpoint outside her home. When Brazil\u2019s new leader, Michel Temer, took the reins of the nation this month \u2014 a milestone in the caustic fight to oust President Dilma Rousseff, who faces an impeachment trial \u2014 he promised a new day of \u201cnational salvation.\u201d  But what Mr. Temer did not mention is that his political party and its allies have wielded immense power here in the oil-rich state of Rio de Janeiro for most of the past decade \u2014 and this place needs a whole lot of saving, too. In other words, critics lament, the same party that created a mess in Rio is now running the country. \u201cRio is evolving into a mini-Venezuela as its leaders find new ways to squander Brazil\u2019s greatest oil bonanza,\u201d said Marcelo Portugal, a Brazilian economist. The state\u2019s finances are a shambles. Some athletes are so disgusted with the City of Rio\u2019s sewage-infested bay that they want the Olympic sailing races moved. Last month, a stretch of a new $12 million bike path flowing gracefully by the coast \u2014 one of Rio\u2019s signature upgrades for the Games \u2014 collapsed after being hit by a wave, causing two men to plummet to their deaths. \u201cThis is everything that we did not want happening at this moment,\u201d said Rio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, a prominent member of Mr. Temer\u2019s party. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to host the Olympics in the current Brazilian environment.\u201d Rio\u2019s leaders had promised that the Olympics would showcase Brazil\u2019s triumphs. Instead, as Mr. Temer scrambles to put Brazil\u2019s economy on stronger footing, Rio is emerging as a cautionary tale of what a government led by his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party could mean for the rest of the nation. Some of the top leaders in Mr. Temer\u2019s party \u2014 including the head of the Senate and the former speaker of the lower house of Congress, who was forced to step down this month to face graft charges \u2014 have been accused of accepting enormous bribes. But their party, known as the P.M.D.B., is also coming under fire over accusations of mismanagement and graft involving the Olympics. Engineering executives have testified that Sergio Cabral, the former governor from the party who helped land the Rio Olympics and still exerts considerable sway, demanded millions in bribes. They say the payments were the equivalent of 5 percent of the cost of the renovation of the landmark Maracan\u00e3 soccer stadium and other public works projects. Mr. Cabral also came under scrutiny for using the state\u2019s helicopters to transport his children, their two nannies and the family dog on weekend jaunts to a beach house. \u201cRio\u2019s politicians are absolutely disgusting,\u201d said Leonardo Siqueira, 37, a cosmetics distributor. He cited the collapse of the bike path, graft scandals involving public works projects and streets that flood with sewage during rains. \u201cRio is in this crisis because of the P.M.D.B.,\u201d Mr. Siqueira said. \u201cThey are politicians who govern first and foremost for themselves, not for the citizens.\u201d In a statement, Mr. Cabral said that he never took bribes and that his security advisers suggested using public helicopters to avoid potential attacks from drug gangs. Under Mr. Cabral, Rio carried out a polarizing \u201cpacification\u201d campaign to police the city aggressively and alter its notorious reputation for crime. But that, too, is coming under strain, with a crime wave marked by muggings throughout the city, an increase in the homicide rate and a terrifying surge in killings of children by stray bullets. In one tragic episode, a 1-year-old boy in a suburb was fatally shot this month while in his car seat. Then there is Rio\u2019s financial crisis, which is occurring despite the revenue from deep-sea oil fields off its coast. The undersea wealth helped turbocharge the regional economy just a few years ago, thanks to legislation giving state and local governments access to a trove of royalties. Now Brazil\u2019s oil industry is in turmoil as Petrobras, the national oil company, reels from bribery scandals and low energy prices. Petrobras, based in a huge Brutalist headquarters downtown, has fired tens of thousands of employees over the past two years, sending a chill across other industries. Rio\u2019s share of oil royalties is plummeting to about $1 billion this year, from $3.5 billion in 2014. Rio\u2019s leaders say the fiscal crisis has forced them to delay pension payments to retired state employees. The education budget was slashed, prompting teachers to strike and high school students to occupy more than a dozen schools to protest deplorable conditions. Some factors in Rio\u2019s crisis are beyond the state\u2019s control, like global oil prices and the weak national economy. But wings of government have preserved their privileges while services suffer. Judges recently won a ruling requiring the state to pay them before honoring other obligations. At the other end of the social spectrum, leaders are cutting back. A program created five years ago to provide cash subsidies of about $22 a month to about 200,000 of the state\u2019s poorest residents ran out of money this month. \u201cI feel deceived as a cabinet member and revolted as a citizen,\u201d Paulo Melo, the state official in charge of antipoverty programs, told reporters. He condemned the state government\u2019s \u201cgeneralized callousness.\u201d Leaders from the P.M.D.B., a largely centrist but ideologically malleable party that provided a facade of democratic opposition during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, had vowed to reverse the decline that characterized Rio after the national capital was moved to Bras\u00edlia in 1960. In 2007, Mr. Cabral took the helm of the state government, which oversees major functions like the police. Altogether, the State of Rio has a population of 16.5 million, almost the size of Chile. Mr. Cabral, 53, nurtured an alliance with the governing Workers\u2019 Party of Ms. Rousseff, enabling Rio to land the Olympics and secure federal funds for projects like a subway expansion. In 2009, the P.M.D.B. also took control of the City of Rio, which has about 6.3 million people. The mayor, Mr. Paes, 46, embarked on a frenetic urban overhaul to highlight Rio on the global stage, refurbishing parts of the old center and installing light rail. In the P.M.D.B.\u2019s favor, most venues for the Olympics have been completed, easing concerns about Rio\u2019s preparations for the Games, in August. On a national level, Mr. Temer has named respected economists from outside the party to important posts. And party leaders say they have provided a \u201cmoderating force\u201d in Brazil\u2019s tumultuous democracy. \u201cThe P.M.D.B. is a pillar of governability,\u201d said Renan Calheiros, the head of the Senate. Here in Rio, Mr. Paes emphasizes that the city\u2019s finances are in better shape than the state\u2019s. Still, his administration faces accusations of ineptitude involving some Olympic projects, highlighted by the collapse in April of part of the new coastal bike path. Protesters in Rio, as elsewhere in Brazil, have long complained that their leaders have prioritized lavish mega-events like the Olympics and the World Cup while neglecting essentials like hospitals and schools. It was a central grievance in the protests that shook the nation three years ago. Now, people wonder about Rio\u2019s capacity to solve its problems. Mr. Cabral\u2019s successor, Luiz Fernando de Souza (known by his nickname, Pez\u00e3o, or Bigfoot), who took office in 2014, also came from the P.M.D.B. As Rio\u2019s problems intensified, Mr. de Souza seemed unusually focused on a painting that hung in his office, \u201cDeath of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1,\u201d depicting the agony of the Portuguese military officer who founded Rio in 1565. Complaining about negative energy emanating from the painting, Mr. de Souza called it \u201creally heavy\u201d and had it removed. A few weeks later, Mr. de Souza, 61, revealed that he was battling non-Hodgkin lymphoma and went on medical leave. His absence left the lieutenant governor, Francisco Dornelles, in charge. A veteran from the Progressive Party \u2014 which hews to conservative ideas and is closely allied with the P.M.D.B. \u2014 Mr. Dornelles, 81, has suggested suspending interest payments on Rio\u2019s debt to ease the state\u2019s woes. \u201cThe P.M.D.B. and its allies have simply run Rio into the ground through their mixture of corruption and stunning incompetence,\u201d said Marcelo Freixo, a prominent state legislator. The self-described pro-business leaders of the P.M.D.B. in Rio are now embracing policies commonly found in leftist countries. To raise money, the state\u2019s leaders approved taxes of nearly 20 percent on offshore oil production in Rio\u2019s waters. At a time of low oil prices, opponents say, the measure could destroy Rio\u2019s oil industry. \u201cThe tax makes most of the projects in Rio unviable,\u201d said Antonio Guimar\u00e3es, the director of the Brazilian Association of Oil Producers. Despite the grim assessments, some in Rio draw on the city\u2019s history of resilience. Ruy Castro, 68, an author, told the magazine Veja that Rio had an \u201cunrivaled capacity to frustrate those who root against the city.\u201d He then added a dash of skepticism. \u201cWe\u2019re good at partying,\u201d Mr. Castro said. \u201cNot at legacies.\u201d", "abstract": "The country\u2019s new governing party has long wielded great power in this oil-rich state \u2014 a place afflicted by crime, graft, pollution and economic woes."}
