She\u2019s a Tomboy.", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\u201cI just wanted to check,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cYour child wants to be called a boy, right? Or is she a boy that wants to be called a girl? Which is it again?\u201d I cocked my head. I am used to correcting strangers, who mistake my 7-year-old daughter for a boy 100 percent of the time. In fact, I love correcting them, making them reconsider their perceptions of what a girl looks like. But my daughter had been attending the after-school program where this woman taught for six months. \u201cShe\u2019s a girl,\u201d I said. The woman looked unconvinced. \u201cReally. She\u2019s a girl, and you can refer to her as a girl.\u201d Later, when I relayed this conversation to my daughter, she said, \u201cMore girls should look like this so it\u2019s more popular so grown-ups won\u2019t be so confused.\u201d My daughter wears track pants and T-shirts. She has shaggy short hair (the look she requested from the hairdresser was \u201cLuke Skywalker in Episode IV\u201d). Most, but not all, of her friends are boys. She is sporty and strong, incredibly sweet, and a girl. And yet she is asked by the pediatrician, by her teachers, by people who have known her for many years, if she feels like, or wants to be called, or wants to be, a boy. In many ways, this is wonderful: It shows a much-needed sensitivity to gender nonconformity and transgender issues. It is considerate of adults to ask her \u2014 in the beginning. But when they continue to question her gender identity \u2014 and are skeptical of her response \u2014 the message they send is that a girl cannot look and act like her and still be a girl. She is not gender nonconforming. She is gender role nonconforming. She does not fit into the mold that we adults \u2014 who have increasingly eschewed millenniums-old gender roles ourselves, as women work outside the home and men participate in the domestic sphere \u2014 still impose upon our children. Left alone, would boys really never wear pink? (That\u2019s rhetorical \u2014 pink was for decades considered a masculine color.) Would girls naturally reject Matchbox cars? Of course not, but if they show preferences for these things, we label them. Somehow, as we have broadened our awareness of and support for gender nonconformity, we\u2019ve narrowed what we think a boy or a girl can look like and do. Let\u2019s be clear: If my daughter does begin to feel that the gender in her mind and the sex of her body don\u2019t match, I will be supportive. I will research puberty blockers and hormones (more than I already have). I will listen to her and make decisions accordingly, just as I did when she turned 3 and asked for a tie and a button-down shirt. Then she saw her father wear a blazer (for once). Her eyes rounded and she said, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d as if she were seeing a double rainbow spread across the sky. She was in love with a look. That look evolved \u2014 sadly she moved from Patti Smith\u2019s tie and blazer to the Dude\u2019s stained T-shirt and sweatpants. But it has always just been a look, even if it came with a rejection of princesses (which also delighted me) and a willingness to play family with both boys and girls as long as she could be the dog or the police officer. I want trans kids to feel free and safe enough to be who they are. I also want adults to have a fluid enough idea of gender roles that a 7-year-old girl can dress like \u201ca boy\u201d and not be asked \u2014 by people who know her, not strangers \u2014 whether she is one. The message I want to send my daughter is this: You are an awesome girl for not giving in to pressure to be and look a certain way. I want her to be proud to be a girl. And she is starting to be. She is already vigilant about women\u2019s rights. She does not understand why there are separate men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports teams, why women earn less and why they don\u2019t run our country. She identifies as a tomboy, because that\u2019s what some kids at school told her she was, though she has also said, \u201cWhy is it a tomboy?\u201d When kids say she\u2019s in the wrong bathroom, she tells them, \u201cI\u2019m a girl,\u201d and invariably they say, \u201cOh, O.K.\u201d The kids get it. But the grown-ups do not. While celebrating the diversity of sexual and gender identities, we also need to celebrate tomboys and other girls who fall outside the narrow confines of gender roles. Don\u2019t tell them that they\u2019re not girls. My daughter is happy with her body and comfortable with the way she looks, thousands of times happier and more comfortable than I am or ever have been. She is my hero. Or rather, my heroine.", "item_type": "Article"}
