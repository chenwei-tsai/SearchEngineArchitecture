The acquisition of \u201cPortrait of an Unknown Lady\u201d (circa 1650-1655), one of only 10 paintings by the artist known to be in existence, was announced at the Tate\u2019s annual news conference on Wednesday, when Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain, affirmed the Tate\u2019s commitment to showing more work by female artists. Little is known about Carlile, the daughter of a Royal Parks official, who reproduced the works of the Italian masters in miniature and also painted portraits. Two of her paintings \u2014 among the few that are known to have survived \u2014 are in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery and the National Trust. A man was thought to be the painter of \u201cPortrait of an Unknown Lady\u201d when it went on sale in 2014 at an auction in the southern English city of Salisbury. It was bought by Bendor Grosvenor, an art dealer and historian who recognized the work as Carlile\u2019s. In an interview with \u201cThe Telegraph,\u201d Mr. Grosvenor said that the artist\u2019s style \u201cis quite recognizable if you know what it looks like.\u201d Mr. Grosvenor added: \u201cAs a portrait painter she\u2019s no Van Dyck. Part of her value lies in her story and background \u2014 but her work is no less fascinating for that.\u201d The portrait will undergo restoration before going on public display.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T02:00:13-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/design/tate-17th-century-portrait-earliest-painting-by-a-woman-joan-carlile.html", "item_type": "Article"}
