{"text": "LONDON \u2014 Emma Rice, whose short stint as the artistic director of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe ended with a spat with the board and a sudden departure from the role, wrote a spirited letter to her successor that was posted to the theater\u2019s website this week. In the letter, addressed to the as-yet-unnamed \u201cfuture artistic director\u201d of the theater, Ms. Rice described the position as the \u201cmost precious of jobs,\u201d and suggested that her decision to leave resulted from disagreements with the theater\u2019s board. \u201cAs important and beloved as the Globe is to me, the Board did not love and respect me back,\u201d she wrote, adding: \u201cThey began to talk of a new set of rules that I did not sign up to and could not stand by. Nothing is worth giving away my artistic freedom for \u2014 it has been too hard fought for.\u201d Ms. Rice, who came to the Globe from the immersive theater company Kneehigh, swan-dived into her role in the spring of 2016, programming several tweaked updates of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, including \u201cImogen,\u201d a version of \u201cCymbeline\u201d that reimagined the work as a female-driven play; and a production of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d starring the cabaret star Meow Meow. Before she took the job at the Globe, Ms. Rice had drawn headlines for comments including an oft-circulated statement that she became \u201cvery sleepy\u201d when trying to read Shakespeare\u2019s plays. The statement issued by the theater announcing her departure said that the decision was mutual, but acknowledged that it came after a disagreement between Ms. Rice and the board about her use of technology, like artificial lighting, in her productions. The Globe, an open-air theater built in 1997, is a relatively loyal re-creation of the theater where many of Shakespeare\u2019s works were originally performed. \u201cI have learnt to love Shakespeare,\u201d Ms. Rice wrote in the note on the website, adding, \u201cI have learnt, never again, to allow myself to be excluded from the rooms where decisions are made.\u201d She did not specify which rooms those were. The theater also published a letter from Ms. Rice\u2019s predecessor, Dominic Dromgoole, which he \u201caddressed to the fearless and fortunate soul\u201d who will next take on the artistic director role. \u201cThe fact that Emma has been stopped in fulfilling her ambitions is heartbreaking,\u201d he wrote in his letter. \u201cIt is also wrong. The spirit of a theater is that it should follow the lead of its artistic director.\u201d He added that the theater\u2019s next director must insist on the autonomy of that role: \u201cEverybody wants to be artistic director. They can\u2019t all be. Only you can.\u201d Mr. Dromgoole also suggested in the letter that he saw naturally-lit productions as central to the theater\u2019s mission. A publicist for the theater said on Friday that neither Ms. Rice nor Mr. Dromgoole was available for further comment. Ms. Rice will stay in her role until April 2018. Applications for the position of artistic director are being accepted until 5 p.m. on Monday, April 24, according to the theater\u2019s website.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/theater/emma-rice-shakespeares-globe-director-letter-to-successor.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T14:48:55-04:00", "abstract": "Ms. Rice wrote that she loved the Globe, but that she has learned not \u201cto allow myself to be excluded from the rooms where decisions are made.\u201d", "title": "Emma Rice, Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Director, Writes Letter to Successor", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Theater", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T14:48:55-04:00"}
