The song\u2019s video, filmed in Atlanta\u2019s tough ninth ward, teems with guns and children. When he opens his mouth to rap, you can see his braces. Six months ago, SahBabii (pronounced SAH-bay-bee), 20, released his third mixtape, \u201cS.A.N.D.A.S.,\u201d and decided that if the attention he was beginning to draw on social media didn\u2019t escalate, he\u2019d leave rap behind. It didn\u2019t help his sense of desperation that two weeks after \u201cS.A.N.D.A.S.\u201d came out, he was fired from his job in a Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods warehouse. Luckily, \u201cPull Up Wit Ah Stick\u201d was becoming something of a viral sensation among Atlanta teenagers after he posted a snippet of it on  Instagram. \u201cI just kept seeing it on the explore page and comments with the fire emojis,\u201d he recalled in conversation at the Hudson Hotel, on the last day of a weeklong stay in New York, his first since formally signing with Warner Bros. The trip was filled with more contrasts: On one night, he played his first New York show on the 10th floor of an academic building at New York University for a crowd full of fashion-forward students with a variety of hair colors. Mona Scott-Young, the music manager turned reality TV mogul who is executive producer of the \u201cLove & Hip-Hop\u201d franchise, stuck close to SahBabii\u2019s father, chatting with him intently. The next night, he performed at the Brooklyn strip club and rapper proving ground Lust. These slightly unlikely juxtapositions were a testament to how quickly the internet can reconfigure young people\u2019s tastes, and an artist\u2019s life. Even just a few years ago, unfiltered hip-hop had a tough time fully cracking the mainstream. But virality has changed all that, giving Rae Sremmurd and Migos No. 1 Billboard singles, and allowing rising stars like SahBabii almost instantaneous access to wide audiences, including N.Y.U. students who, when he first gazed upon them, he worried \u2014 quite wrongly \u2014 that \u201cthey ain\u2019t really listen to rap.\u201d SahBabii was born Saaheem Valdery in Chicago, and lived in the Wentworth Gardens projects until moving to Atlanta at 13. His older brother, T3, made music, and he grew up idolizing rappers like Young Thug and Cash Out, who were local heroes: \u201cI used to see them at Kroger,\u201d he said. Inspired by a generation of young Atlanta rappers, many of them teenagers \u2014 Rich Kidz, Polo Boyz, Money Savage \u2014 SahBabii began to rap. \u201cThat\u2019s what made me want to get into it more, \u2019cause I seen kids my age doing this,\u201d he said, \u201cversus when I was in Chicago, younger, it wasn\u2019t really no fun. It was gangbanging and whatever going on.\u201d He released two mixtapes as a young teenager, \u201cPimpin Ain\u2019t Eazy\u201d and \u201cGlocks & Thots,\u201d that received little notice, and damaged his confidence. \u201cI was stressed out,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a bald spot, I was smoking a lot, cigarettes and weed. I was real depressed.\u201d Most of the songs for \u201cS.A.N.D.A.S.\u201d were recorded after a hiatus, using the production program Cubase in his brother\u2019s bedroom with a broken microphone. The beats, slow and dreamlike, were pulled from YouTube, and T3 engineered the songs, giving them a silken sheen. The mixtape is strikingly gentle, full of warm sing-rapping over ambient and piano-driven production. (He recently put a call out on Twitter for new beats: \u201cMelodic Sounds NO TRAP BEATS!\u201d) It\u2019s soothing, and almost ethereal, perhaps the final step in the conjoining of the melodic developments ushered into the genre by Drake and the psychedelic vocal approach of Young Thug, who SahBabii most closely recalls, but smoothed out and less eccentric, with a strong emphasis on hook. Typically, he records those first \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s your steak and potatoes,\u201d he said \u2014 then mumbles a melody for the verses, and finally fills them in with words. Thus far, SahBabii\u2019s career has been family business. For this trip to New York, he traveled with a big contingent, including much of his family: his father, Delval, who is his manager; his mother, Kimberly; his brother, T3; and more. In a group conversation, they recalled juggling jobs to make ends meet. T3 said that when they couldn\u2019t afford to press up CDs, they printed out business cards with a type of bar code to download the mixtape on the back. Delval Valdery talked about his days as a gang leader in Chicago, going straight, and eventually leaving his job at Marta, Atlanta\u2019s public rail transportation, to help supervise his son\u2019s burgeoning career, forming a production company, Casting Bait Music Group (that already owns the trademark to \u201cpull up wit ah stick\u201d). In short order, when SahBabii\u2019s music began to truly take off, everyone else quit their jobs to help make the vision a reality. As for the hypergraphic imagery in the \u201cPull Up Wit Ah Stick\u201d video, SahBabii\u2019s parents were sanguine. \u201cI knew people was gonna have something to say,\u201d Kimberly Valdery said, then pointed to the company\u2019s name. \u201cBut you wanna bait \u2019em in, so we knew that was gonna bait \u2019em in.\u201d", "abstract": "The 20-year-old Atlanta artist came to New York for a trip that demonstrated how quickly the internet can change a rapper\u2019s life."}
