It had the equivalent of 221,000 sales in the United States, including 166,000 copies sold of the full album and nearly 60 million streams of its songs, according to Nielsen. The Chainsmokers\u2019 combined sales and streams gave them an easy win this week, but Drake\u2019s playlist \u201cMore Life\u201d (Republic) had far more streams \u2014 no surprise for the project (and the artist) that has consistently dominated online services like Spotify and Apple Music. Songs on \u201cMore Life\u201d were streamed 135 million times last week, although sales of the full playlist amounted to just 10,000; Nielsen and Billboard\u2019s new formula for comparing the various kinds of music consumption credits \u201cMore Life\u201d with a total of 108,000 \u201cequivalent units.\u201d Also this week, Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201c\u00f7\u201d (Atlantic) fell to No. 3 \u2014 that \u201cEgg Sheeran\u201d Easter meme, while adorable, wasn\u2019t quite enough to lift sales \u2014 and \u201cPTX Vol. IV: Classics\u201d (RCA), the latest by the perma-perky a cappella group Pentatonix, opens at No. 4 with the equivalent of 54,000 sales. Two other new releases reached the Top 10 this week: the Brooklyn rapper Joey Badass bowed at No. 5 with \u201cAll-Amerikkkan Badass\u201d (Cinematic), and the sharp-tongued singer-songwriter Father John Misty reached No. 10 with \u201cPure Comedy\u201d (Sub Pop)."}
