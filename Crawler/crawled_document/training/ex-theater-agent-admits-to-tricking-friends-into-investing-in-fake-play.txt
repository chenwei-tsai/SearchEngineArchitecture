The former agent, Roland Scahill, 42, pleaded guilty to grand larceny and fraud charges in State Supreme Court in Manhattan under an arrangement that calls for him to be sentenced to six months in jail and five years\u2019 probation, according to court papers. As part of the deal, Mr. Scahill must repay $189,000 over the next six months to the investors he bilked. He must also receive psychiatric treatment. \u201cWe are pleased to have brought his larcenous scheme to a grand finale,\u201d the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement. As he entered his plea, Mr. Scahill admitted to Justice Charles Solomon that he had \u201cconcocted a scheme\u201d to trick investors into putting money into a phantom production. He said he had pretended to have obtained the rights to the life story of the opera singer Kathleen Battle and intended to produce a one-woman show starring Ms. Nyong\u2019o. He told the investors \u2014 most of them close friends \u2014 that the play would chronicle the day in 1994 when Ms. Battle was fired by the Metropolitan Opera. Mr. Scahill, who had formed a company called RMS2 Productions, also admitted to falsely telling investors that he had procured the Booth Theater to stage the production and had secured a contract with Netflix to stream a performance of the show. \u201cAll these representations were false,\u201d he said, according to the plea agreement. More than 10 sets of investors gave Mr. Scahill a total of around $200,000 between October 2014 and August 2015, wiring the money to two bank accounts he controlled, he said in the plea agreement. Some of the money was spent on personal expenses. He said he had used the rest to buy securities. Mr. Scahill, a 1997 graduate of Cornell University, worked for more than a decade at the William Morris Agency and its successor, William Morris Endeavor Entertainment. He also worked for about 18 months at the Gersh Agency before leaving and forming RMS2 Productions.", "title": "Ex-Theater Agent Admits to Tricking Friends Into Investing in Fake Play", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T19:00:36-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/ex-theater-agent-admits-to-tricking-friends-into-investing-in-fake-play.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00"}
