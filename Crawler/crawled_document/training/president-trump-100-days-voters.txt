Local party bosses and state senators, teachers and retirees, unionized and nonunion workers, talking about their hopes and dread as a brash untested leader strode into the world\u2019s most consequential job. Now, as President Trump approaches his 100th day in office, we wanted to circle back to some of the voters \u2014 most of them Trump supporters \u2014 we had spoken with around the start of his presidency about the issues that had driven their votes. Had Mr. Trump fulfilled his promises? Did his struggles and slack poll numbers disappoint them? Was he pleasing any of his detractors, or proving worse than they had feared? Many of his biggest backers said they had no regrets. No matter how few legislative accomplishments Mr. Trump can list, no matter the problems facing \u201cthe Wall,\u201d no matter if his Twitter posts make them wince, they praised his swagger, his executive orders and Supreme Court appointment. \u201cHitting it out of the ballpark,\u201d said Dianna Ploss, a former nurse in Massachusetts. Others who opposed him then said they oppose him even more now. \u201cWhen I get up in the morning, I think, \u2018Well, what did Trump do now?\u2019\u201d said Diane Kirt, 64, of Reedsburg, Wis. But his critics have newfound energy and inspiration from protests that have propelled millions into the streets and nudged some to make first-time runs for public office. And then there are those somewhere in between. Some who were reluctant in November say they are happy with a growing economy and his support for the military. Some who cast a hedged, qualified vote for Mr. Trump say they are frustrated with his temperament and repeated falsehoods and would consider supporting a primary challenger. Others say: Give it more time \u2014 100 more days, or 1,000. Al Exner, Republican Party chairman of Sauk County, Wis., made no secret of his delight over Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as he chatted in January in a diner in one of America\u2019s most closely divided places. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton was a mere 109 votes here, part of a shift that flipped Wisconsin from blue to red. Now, Mr. Exner said he was pleased, reflecting Mr. Trump\u2019s overwhelming and enduring support among Republicans even as opinion surveys give him historically low marks. Still, Mr. Exner was hard pressed to name more than a few accomplishments. He said the airstrike Mr. Trump ordered on Syria resounded as a declaration of American strength. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the back burner, defensively, since Obama took office,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first thing I said to my wife when I heard about Syria was, \u2018Syria isn\u2019t really the target. He\u2019s put the world on notice \u2014 we\u2019re back.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Julie Bosman Back in January, Maureen Sauer had to be coaxed into traveling to the Women\u2019s March on Washington from her home in O\u2019Fallon, Ill. She has a bad back and she did not think marching would make any difference. But her sisters prevailed, and the march proved an inspiration. Now, she is active in a church group called Dormant No More, trying to bring about change in her own town. She joined the school board and the local League of Women Voters, attended her first City Council meeting and worked to oust the mayor. The first 100 days of the Trump presidency have proved worse than Ms. Sauer, 55, feared, but she said the best part is that it had spurred activism. \u201cHe has brought us off our couches, paying attention,\u201d she said. She worries the most about how much Russia interfered with the election, and what the links may be to Mr. Trump or his campaign. \u2014 Susan Chira At the dawn of the Trump era, Brandon Moore, 39, sat down inside a Mexican restaurant in central Ohio and counted himself a hopeful skeptic. As a Bible-believing Christian and supporter of gun rights, he had voted for Mr. Trump but was watchful. And today? \u201cI do have mixed feelings,\u201d he said. He liked Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to order a missile attack on a Syrian airfield because it showed that \u201cAmerica means business again.\u201d He liked how Mr. Trump baited and sparred with the news media. But as the nation searches for its political bearings ahead of the next election cycle, Mr. Moore said that watching months of anti-Trump protests and outpourings of left-wing activism these past 100 days had convinced him of this much: \u201cThat\u2019s where I don\u2019t want our country to go: into their hands.\u201d \u2014 Jack Healy Matthew Heimbach, 26, is among the young men who identify with the alt-right, the amalgam of white supremacist and misogynist internet trolls and citizens who were energized by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. This month, Mr. Heimbach said he felt more invigorated than ever. \u201cHe did what we in the alt-right wanted him to do,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump had brought anti-immigrant sentiment into the mainstream, destabilized politics and polarized the electorate, Mr. Heimbach said. \u201cOur movement, it\u2019s gotten more unified,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten more clear on direction as to what we\u2019re working toward, which is an independent homeland.\u201d At white nationalist events these days, he said, he is often among the oldest in the room, a stark difference from pre-Trump years, in which the people who shared his views were often twice his age. Mr. Heimbach runs a group called the Traditionalist Worker Party, which advocates replacing the United States with nation-states based on races, ethnicities and religions. He said that vision seems closer than ever. \u201cGetting Trump elected was a great first step,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to deploy to Stage 2.\u201d \u2014 Julie Turkewitz Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt talk has always been a selling point for State Senator Mark R. Maynard, 44, a freshman lawmaker in West Virginia and a Republican who was a leader of Mr. Trump\u2019s state campaign. So it was unsurprising that close to 100 days in, Mr. Maynard had nothing bad to say about Mr. Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip talk and style, which has been such a departure from previous presidents. In fact, Mr. Maynard, who hails from tiny Genoa, W.Va., could not think of a single criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure thus far. He liked Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on President Barack Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. And he said his optimism is widely shared in his district, set in the struggling heart of Appalachia and coal country. \u201cYou know, everybody that I talk to has a positive rating, and they like what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard any complaints \u2014 and that\u2019s my feelings, too.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Maynard, a climate change skeptic, praised Mr. Trump for his executive order in March that will undo the Clean Power Plan in an effort to lift the coal industry. Even Mr. Trump\u2019s failures \u2014 the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the travel ban blocked by a federal judge \u2014 seemed reassuring to Mr. Maynard because they showed that Mr. Trump was trying to do what he had promised. \u201cI think attempting is better than doing nothing, whether you\u2019re successful or not,\u201d he said. \u2014 Richard Fausset At a rally in Ambridge, Pa., a once-thriving steel and energy town and a symbol of the losses and grievances that powered Mr. Trump to the White House, Ron Ritz waited in line for hours to see the candidate. Back then, in October, Mr. Ritz said of Mr. Trump, \u201cI think he\u2019s going to try to give the American people back the things they deserve that were taken from them.\u201d Mr. Ritz, a 69-year-old retired corrections officer and military veteran, believes that Mr. Trump has restored optimism about the American economy. Near his small hometown, Friedens, Pa., there was a shuttered coal mine, which he said started up again after Mr. Trump took office. \u201cGuys that were laid off are going back to work,\u201d he said. For him, the best moment of the presidency so far was when Mr. Trump visited coal miners in West Virginia. \u201cI know what those people feel like,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a time in my life I was almost swept under. To see them get another glimpse of light, that says there\u2019s some hope here.\u201d \u2014 Susan Chira In Iowa, Mary Whisenand compared Mr. Trump in September 2015 to a \u201csummer fling\u201d that Republicans would soon get over as they turned to other candidates. Throughout the primary race and general election, Ms. Whisenand, a longtime party activist, never worked to elect Mr. Trump. She said recently she did not declare her support for him until Nov. 8, Election Day, when she cast a ballot for him. But she ended up attending his inauguration in Washington, and today she defends many of his stumbles as the learning curve of a nonpolitician, one who is keeping his word to shake up government. Ms. Whisenand, 52, an insurance executive in Des Moines, cites his ability to ignore critics in the news media as a sign of success. \u201cHe is not making decisions based on polling of what the media is saying,\u201d she said. \u201cI like that about him.\u201d But, she added, \u201cI wish to God he had never tweeted about Obama wiretapping him.\u201d The attempts by Trump allies in the White House and Congress to try to prove Mr. Trump right \u201clooked like the Keystone Kops,\u201d she added. \u2014 Trip Gabriel Joe Vigue, 68, came to Mr. Trump reluctantly. As he watched election-night returns stream in at a hotel ballroom in Concord, N.H., a retired construction worker in bluejeans amid a sea of suits, Mr. Vigue ticked off a list of concerns about the military and Mr. Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about Senator John McCain. Now, Mr. Vigue, a Vietnam veteran, is pretty happy with what he sees, especially on the issue most important to him: beefing up the military. Mr. Trump has proposed slashing billions from various domestic programs and shifting $54 billion to the armed forces. And he applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs, reduce wait times for veterans seeking health care and protect their benefits. He still winces once in a while when Mr. Trump \u201copens his mouth,\u201d but he said the country was much better off than it had been during the previous eight years. To his relief, Mr. Vigue has found Mr. Trump to be \u201cnot quite as conservative as a lot of people thought.\u201d Back in November, he said he did not want Mr. Trump to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and as it happens, Mr. Trump failed to do so when he tried. \u201cSo far, I\u2019m glad I voted for him,\u201d Mr. Vigue said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t so sure for a while, but now I am.\u201d \u2014 Katharine Q.
