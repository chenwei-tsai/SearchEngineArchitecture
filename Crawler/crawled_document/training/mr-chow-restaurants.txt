{"text": "Michael Chow looked at ease in his favorite banquette at the Carlyle hotel, beneath a portrait of Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper in their \u201cEasy Rider\u201d prime, but something in his peripheral vision nagged at him. A nearby couple had gotten up to avail themselves of the breakfast buffet, leaving their table askew. Through his signature circular spectacles, Mr. Chow kept darting glances that way. \u201cThe table\u2019s not straight,\u201d he finally said, giving the impression that he was prepared to get up and tackle the symmetry issue on his own if need be. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the restaurant business too long.\u201d That longevity, he contends, has hinged on his paying attention to countless details, both great and small. Mr. Chow opened Mr. Chow \u2014 the original, in a glamorous neighborhood of London \u2014 on Valentine\u2019s Day in 1968. Almost half a century later, at the age of 77, he can remember how that felt. \u201cOn the first night, everybody came: the Stones, the Beatles,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody was rocking. The energy there was fantastic.\u201d It snowballed. A Beverly Hills, Calif., branch opened in 1974; in 1978, Mr. Chow came to East 57th Street, and 10 years ago, to TriBeCa. Everything that was surging in high art and pop culture seemed to converge and collide over noodles and dumplings at Mr. Chow. He ticked off the names of film directors, musicians, actors, painters and models like Federico Fellini, Daniel Barenboim, Jack Nicholson, David Hockney, Yoko Ono, Jerry Hall. But along with success came scrutiny, including a scathing zero-star review in The New York Times from Frank Bruni, who wrote in 2006 of a lamb shank at the TriBeCa restaurant: \u201cIf I learned that it had been plucked from a freezer after the better part of a decade and then nuked in a microwave for the better part of a day, I\u2019d be shocked. It didn\u2019t taste nearly that tender or flavorful.\u201d Adam Platt, the New York magazine critic, reported that \u201ca dish called Drunken Fish ($31 \u00e0 la carte) consisted of a couple of wet pieces of sole sunk in a curious gelatinous substance which had no color and very little taste and looked perilously like pond slime.\u201d Under normal circumstances, lines like those would be enough to sink a restaurant. Yet the Mr. Chows in Los Angeles and New York are still thriving, drawing celebrities and other customers who weren\u2019t born yet in 1968, or 1974, or 1978. Somehow, at a time when 10 years seems a full life span for big-city restaurants, Mr. Chow persists, and even grows. A Las Vegas outpost arrived at Caesars Palace late last year; a Mexico City version is around the corner, and Mr. Chow is building a 60,000-square-foot art and cuisine center in Los Angeles. In this sense, the Mr. Chow brand has evolved into a prime example of the bulletproof restaurant. Just as there are superhero movies and hit songs that continue to rally a wide audience despite the wincing disapproval of critics, the allure of Mr. Chow does not seem to dim no matter how many times customers are told that they\u2019re crazy to pay that much for stir-fry. If critics tend to say that nobody goes to Mr. Chow for the food, Mr. Chow and his wife, Eva, who plays a key role in the brand\u2019s expansion, beg to differ. Their fare is an authentic reflection of Beijing cuisine, they say, and they recruit chefs and cooks from Hong Kong and Beijing to prepare it. \u201cSticky-sweet,\u201d \u201cgooey-sweet\u201d and \u201ccrunchy-sweet\u201d can seem to be the dominant effects, but for diners who hew closely to the dependable territory of soup dumplings and salt-and-pepper prawns, a pleasant meal can be had. Should you point out that the prices seem punishingly high (Beijing duck, for instance, is $74 per person), Mr. Chow will smile and nod in affirmation. Steep prices are part of the strategy. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s so expensive,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI say, \u2018Fantastic!\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cExpensive is important. Very important.\u201d First off, charging exorbitant prices has allowed him to make a statement about the cuisine of his homeland. (His name at birth, in Shanghai, was Zhou Yinghua; his father, Zhou Xinfang, was a titanic star of the Peking Opera.) \u201cChinese food was supposed to be cheap,\u201d Mr. Chow said. \u201cI changed all that. But it took me almost half a century.\u201d He is happy to go further. (\u201cToo old to be too cautious,\u201d he said.) Are those pricey portions at Mr. Chow noticeably small? Yes, he said, on purpose. He always wanted portion sizes to stand in stark opposition to the heaping platters at chain restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory, where you might dig into \u201ca salad you keep eating for two hours.\u201d (At breakfast in the Carlyle, he consumed only a bowl of plain yogurt.) High prices have also allowed him to foster the see-and-be-seen cachet he wants to cultivate. To this day, a Champagne cart rolls up alongside your table when you sit down at Mr. Chow. \u201cChampagne is luxury,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere\u2019s no luxury without fantasy. And no fantasy without sex.\u201d Does it seem like kind of a show? It\u2019s supposed to. \u201cIt\u2019s all about theater,\u201d said Mr. Chow, also a painter whose artwork was recently shown in an exhibition at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that you cast it like a theater. It\u2019s all about, \u2018Don\u2019t bore the audience.\u2019\u201d Servers, whose ancestral homelands are apt to lie closer to the Mediterranean than to the Yellow Sea, hover like Broadway stagehands, making sure that props are in place. At his table at the Carlyle, Mr. Chow demonstrated how he always wants the tines of a fork to be pointed downward, toward the table. (He harbors an anxiety that when they are pointed upward, someone could accidentally smack them and send the fork flying into an eye.) It can take weeks, he said, to teach a server to place the utensils properly. \u201cIf you build an environment based on details like that, you will create a harmony,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single thing you do properly. It\u2019s all connected.\u201d Julian Schnabel, the artist and filmmaker who has been a Mr. Chow regular since around 1980, said that sense of harmony can be felt from the moment you pass through the front door. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re going somewhere auspicious when you go there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of ceremony about it. He\u2019s got a method to his madness, I guess.\u201d In his 1996 film, \u201cBasquiat,\u201d a portrait of his friend the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, Mr. Schnabel shot scenes in the Midtown Mr. Chow to recreate the ambience of a place where stalwarts of the Upper East Side establishment could trade glances with strivers from the worlds of avant-garde painting and hip-hop. \u201cI think there\u2019s a great understanding of spaces, in the places he has, so that people can see each other,\u201d he said. The actress Olivia Wilde, a frequent customer at Mr. Chow in TriBeCa and elsewhere, echoed that notion of ceremony. \u201cIt makes you feel like you are part of something that is larger than just a meal,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why people are drawn to it.\u201d If there is something cinematic about the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, that is probably no accident. Ms. Wilde said that she and Mr. Chow have a continuing conversation in which she will randomly mention the name of a movie from the past century. \u201cHe can tell you the opening shot of the film,\u201d she said. \u201cI challenge you to challenge him.\u201d His attention to detail applies to customers, too. When her son, Otis, was 9 days old, Ms. Wilde and her partner, the actor Jason Sudeikis, dropped into Mr. Chow for a meal. She soon realized that she needed to heat up some milk to feed the baby. Servers took note. \u201cThey brought me the most beautiful silver bowl of water to warm up the breast milk,\u201d she said with a laugh. If there is one central principle that keeps the Mr. Chow mission chugging along, it\u2019s the same that applies to Shake Shack or Starbucks: consistency. If you are familiar with the menu at the Southern California branch of Mr. Chow, and happen to drift into the Midtown Manhattan branch, don\u2019t worry: The menu is essentially the same. \u201cI do love how loyal to the original menu they stay,\u201d Ms. Wilde said. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to be able to walk in and not look at a menu: \u2018This is what I want. This is what I\u2019m craving.\u2019\u201d In Beverly Hills, \u201cwe have waiters that have been with us since 1974,\u201d Ms. Chow said. Many of today\u2019s loyal customers, she added, are the children of their fans from the 1970s and \u201980s. The couple live in Los Angeles but are buying a place in Brooklyn. Ms. Chow recently worked closely with a manufacturer in Ohio to help create mass-market versions of three signature Mr. Chow sauces. Mr. Chow has three children: China, Asia and Maximillian, who is the head of culinary operations for the restaurants. (He has been married three times, once to the fashion editor Grace Coddington.) Ultimately, the secret behind Mr. Chow may simply be Mr. Chow himself. There is a reason the man\u2019s portrait has been painted by the likes of Warhol, Basquiat and Keith Haring. In person, he is effortlessly charming and unflappable, tossing out quotes from philosophers and smiling in a way that suggests that critics who harp on the air-kissy, grand-operatic excess of his restaurants are missing the point. Running a restaurant is rumored to be impossible. Mr. Chow respectfully disagrees. \u201cVery easy, no?\u201d he said. \u201cBe true to yourself \u2014 you can\u2019t go wrong. Don\u2019t follow trends. Be yourself. Just be true.\u201d Moments later, having left the Carlyle, he sent a text that signed off with his own emoticon: ~O-O~.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/dining/mr-chow-restaurants.html", "published_date": "2016-08-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Food", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T10:00:08-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T10:00:08-04:00", "abstract": "The most bulletproof of restaurants is the work of a man who sweats the details but not the criticism.", "title": "Sky-High Prices?
