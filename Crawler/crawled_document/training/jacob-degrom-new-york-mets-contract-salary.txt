{"text": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. \u2014 Brown hair flowing from beneath his blue-and-orange cap, Jacob deGrom moved not a strand when asked about that little old contract deal. There was no shaking of the head, but, without question, it\u2019s still a sore subject. \u201cI already talked about it, me and my agent,\u201d deGrom said, sitting at his dressing stall Monday morning in the Mets\u2019 clubhouse, fiddling with his smartphone. \u201cThat was last week.\u201d \u201cSo last week,\u201d Sandy Alderson, the Mets\u2019 general manager, concurred a short while later. Last week was about what deGrom described as a \u201cbusiness decision,\u201d his not accepting the $607,000 salary the Mets assigned him this season \u2014 a formality since he had no negotiating leverage as a player, with not enough major league service to force salary arbitration. Friday\u2019s story jarred memories of the utterly awkward Matt Harvey innings watch of 2015, but it was clear on Monday that the Mets, deGrom included, preferred to move on to this week\u2019s narrative. That is, the unveiling of their formidable array of starting pitchers, with Bartolo Colon throwing three innings and allowing one run in a 7-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers, and Steven Matz also debuting with three innings and one run in a split-squad 9-4 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in Jupiter, Fla. On Tuesday, Harvey will make the drive to the Disney complex to pitch against Atlanta, deGrom will welcome the Yankees to Port St. Lucie on Wednesday, and Noah Syndergaard will follow against the Cardinals on Thursday. Time to work out winter\u2019s rust and remind the National League of how the Mets\u2019 powerful rotation is the envy of the industry. But the subject of baseball economics, or how to preserve and protect their most valuable assets, remains a delicate and potentially divisive one for the Mets. Kicking big-pitching-contract cans down the road while pursuing a return to the World Series may be their most conservative strategy. It still comes with the possibility of antagonizing fans sensing a yearslong recompense for all they have suffered and, worse, planting a seed of doubt or disgust into the mind of deGrom, in this most current case. On Friday, deGrom did say, \u201cwe\u2019re still open to discussing some long-term things\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t think this will have any effect on that.\u201d But a roughly $50,000 raise for an All-Star pitcher who won 14 games, was at times dominating into the postseason, and stretched his pitch counts in the process, was obviously taken as inflexible and stingy on the part of the Mets. Baseball\u2019s longstanding arbitration system for players with three years in the majors \u2014 long considered fair and equitable \u2014 should at least be re-examined in the aftermath of the Harvey case, which raised important issues on risk and potential reward for the young and precocious. Comparing other professional sports can be an apples-and-oranges undertaking, but for context of how long a slog it can be for a major leaguer to earn anything close to fair market value, let\u2019s consider an at-best marginal Knick \u2014 Cleanthony Early. A second-year player who has been idle for most of this season after being shot in a late-night misadventure, Early is making $845,059. Shane Larkin, a third-year point guard already on his third team, the Nets, is raking in $1.5 million this season. Browse the rosters of the Giants and the Jets, and you will find scores of players you wouldn\u2019t recognize if they tackled you on the street making double and triple what deGrom, a star, will make in 2016. The best young basketball stars can also be restricted free agents after four years, though Alderson rightly noted that basketball and football use the college system as a minor-league-breeding and player-branding ground. \u201cThe N.B.A. doesn\u2019t spend a dime \u2014 maybe a little more, recently, with their D-League \u2014 but we put a lot of time and money in our minor league system, and it can take three to six years for players to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not involved in the collective bargaining agreement, so maybe I\u2019m a little more myopic about it. But, O.K., it\u2019s the system we have. We want to use it to our advantage, governed by a sense of fairness, how we relate to the entire industry and how we relate to the players.\u201d He did add, \u201cThat\u2019s not always achieved.\u201d Alderson called deGrom \u201can interesting situation \u2014 signed at an older age, was injured early on in his career, has only a year and a half of major league service and is 27.\u201d He is also a player who won\u2019t be eligible for arbitration until 2018 and unfettered free agency until 2021. Barring injury, deGrom will earn millions \u2014 as Harvey is now \u2014 during his arbitration years, if the Mets do not sign him to a long-term extension. But given his unusual circumstances \u2014 an outlier on the developmental scale but an instant and charismatic star \u2014 would a few extra hundred-thousand dollars have bankrupted the Wilpon family? A token of the Mets\u2019 appreciation would also have sent a message to deGrom, Syndergaard and Matz that the organization wants them to be as sound of mind as they are strong of arm in the years ahead. For all the celebrating of the Yoenis Cespedes signing, he may yet be a one-season story. David Wright gave another update Monday on his playing status \u2014 \u201cI think we\u2019re close; everything is going exactly the way we discussed it; the back feels fine\u201d \u2014 but his long-range health forecast must be called cloudy. In other words, the pitchers are the backbone of the franchise. No news flash there, but these are young, insecure athletes, and their understanding \u2014 or misunderstanding \u2014 of what the Mets ultimately have in mind could affect them, and the team. Asked the best way to ensure there is no lingering acrimony with deGrom, Alderson said, \u201cFor us not to give the story or the issue any legs. Put it aside, and move on.\u201d For this week, no problem.
