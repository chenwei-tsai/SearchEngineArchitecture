Jami Attenberg recalls how a friendship deepened in Sicily (below). Sarah Hepola remembers a road trip \u2014 and an uncertain future \u2014 in Mexico. And Sloane Crosley looks back at a relationship that took three trips to kill.  We also have six writers recounting transformative moments that happened while traveling; a roundup of new hotels and resorts for all kinds of relationships, and a collection of readers\u2019 stories of loves found and lost on the road. We met in Toronto, Viola Di Grado and I. We were attending a literary festival, and I saw her across the room in a crowded hospitality suite at a harborfront hotel, amid all the writers eagerly suckling the free liquor. She was 15 years my junior, an Italian baby goth princess: pin thin, long blond hair, a childlike face, wearing dark eyeliner and a dramatic black Victorian gown. I immediately thought: Her, I must know. We talked briefly and had an instant ease around each other, a major triumph among writers. (Most of us are inherently awkward creatures.) The next day we became friends on Facebook. It is always good to have a new contact in a foreign country, I remember thinking at the time. What more could I expect from this stranger I met for only a few moments? But over the four years that passed since we met, Viola became more than that. Even though we communicated only via the internet, having long, funny, intimate chats, she became a confidante (and, more recently, with my latest book, my Italian translator). I\u2019ve read and loved her novels, which revolve around young, unconventional women who have complicated relationships with reality, and are often otherworldly. My favorite, \u201cHollow Heart,\u201d is written from the perspective of a ghost, a suicide victim who is haunting the living. Viola is, predictably, wise beyond her years; emotionally, I am permanently trapped in my early 30s, so together we make a good friend match. I knew someday we would meet again; it was just a question of when and where. Then, last fall, my Italian publisher arranged a tour for me for my most recent book, starting in Milan and ending at my favorite Italian bookstore, Modusvivendi Libreria, in Palermo in Sicily. Viola is from Catania, on the opposite side of the island, about two and half hours away by bus. She agreed to meet me for two days, with two nights of readings at the store \u2014 a long time to spend with someone you have met only for a few minutes. Still, I loved the idea of an emotional adventure, taking a risk. We would see if our brief meeting four years before was a fluke or if our May-December friendship was built to last. I\u2019d been to Palermo before, in 2014, to visit the same bookstore. My time there had been limited to one night and one day, and most of my exploring had involved hunting for street food along its back alleys. Palermo is a highly walkable city, with cobblestone streets that seem eternally damp, and, at least by daylight, safe. A day\u2019s amble there seemed like a fine waste of time at that moment, though I didn\u2019t leave Palermo knowing much more about it than when I had arrived. But now was my chance to get to know the city better. And we were off to a fine start as the bookstore had generously arranged for our lodgings in a literary-inspired Airbnb. Bed and Book is a sunny, bright, two-story building with bookshelves full of first editions, and an outdoor seating area where readings and book club discussions are held. Marco, the cool, young proprietor, has a Ph.D. in cultural studies and semiotics, and was writing a book about street and urban art. He even took us on a brief tour of Palermo street art. But Viola was to be my true guide. And Viola had opinions about Palermo, not to mention Italy in general. For me, the best way to get to know a city is the same as with a human being: learn both the flaws and the charms. I cannot fully love something until I know both. To my eye Palermo had seemed like a pretty, crumbling city, perhaps careless in its beauty. Viola saw something else. \u201cIt\u2019s a Jackson Pollock painting in city form,\u201d she said over coffee the next morning, before we set out on our adventure for the day. \u201cThere is an abstract quality in the structure of its everyday life, in the way cars and people and everything interact, and it\u2019s very violent and unpredictable. Like, you never know, a car could hit you while you\u2019re walking on the sidewalk.\u201d I found this thrilling \u2014 not the getting hit by a car part, but the unpredictability. Anything could happen. After 18 years in New York City, I long always for a surprise. Viola suggested we spend our morning visiting the Capuchin Catacombs. We left our lodgings, taking the pedestrian path of the city\u2019s oldest street, Via Vittorio Emanuele, home to many historic buildings as well as beautifully weathered, balconied apartments and tourist shops. We passed the broad and impressive Palermo Cathedral, its many towers softened by the occasional palm tree. And then we walked beneath the Porta Nuova, a triumphal arch that dates to the 1500s, and I felt as if I were leaving one part of the city for another. Until that point, everything had been tall and spacious, a testament, as I always feel in so many European cities, to masculinity. But as we veered up Via Cappuccini toward the catacombs, the streets grew more cluttered, the buildings more humble, the sidewalks more narrow and crowded with garbage and oddly parked vehicles, until we were dodging speeding scooters. Viola was annoyed by the tumult, but I think slightly pleased, too, that her point was proved. And then we arrived at the catacombs, their exterior a plain, graying building with a small plaza and parking lot. Nothing seemed suspect. Heretofore my main understanding of catacombs had been from \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d in a scene where the von Trapps seek shelter from the Nazis; it was a place where dead bodies were hidden away from innocent eyes. The Palermo catacombs, however, were not made for Technicolor. We entered, and walked down to the depths of the building. Look, I haven\u2019t seen it all, but I\u2019ve seen a lot. And I was definitely not expecting hundreds of mummified corpses hanging in airless, limestone corridors beneath the city streets. I let out a genuine noise of surprise, a mumbled, \u201cOh my God.\u201d The corpses \u2014 1,252 in total \u2014 were all dressed in centuries-old attire. Viola, of course, was delighted by my shock. A gift from one writer friend to another: a genuinely memorable experience, one that could be breathlessly recounted over cocktails for years to come. The catacombs, first founded in the 16th century as a place to house deceased friars, were the most haunted place I\u2019ve ever been. I sensed a specific energy in the particles in the air; there was a thickness to it, as if they were parting and allowing us in as we moved through the space, pushing us along. Practically every inch of wall space was decorated with a dead body. There was no downtime for the mind. We were fully present with death. Just when I had gotten over the shock and had grown accustomed to the atmosphere, we approached the cavallo di battaglia, a small child encased in a glass coffin. \u201cThis was what I wanted to see,\u201d Viola said excitedly. It was Rosalia Lombardo, the last person to be embalmed in the catacombs. She had died at the age of 2 in 1920. Viola explained that because the child had been embalmed much later than the friars and the rest of the townspeople, a different method had been used on her, which helped to preserve her better. I looked closely. She looked perfectly human, but her skin was purple. There was a small bow in her hair. \u201cThat is \u2026 no joke,\u201d I said, and held myself steady. A hundred stories blossomed in my head about a purple child sleeping in a glass case forever. There could be no more surprises left, I was certain, but oh, no, there was one more delight waiting for us. For around the corner was a nook of female forms hanging high on the wall, with words painted next to them. Viola translated: \u201cThey are virgins, they follow the lamb\u201d \u2014 they had kept themselves pure for God. We both smirked. \u201cWhy is it the women always have to be the virgins?\u201d I said. \u201cStuck sexless for eternity, that doesn\u2019t seem fair at all.\u201d Outside I bought a postcard of the virgins, so I could remember them forever. As if there was any chance of forgetting them. \u201cI will take you to eat something good now,\u201d said Viola, as we wormed our way through back streets, clotheslines overhead, passing a small pup watching the world go by in a sunny window, until we found the Pasticceria Cappello, a gleaming bakery overlooking Palermo. We sat outside and ate a slice of setteveli, a seven-layer chocolate hazelnut cake (veli means veils), reportedly invented at the pasticceria. As we ate, Viola told me the most salacious story about the Italian publishing industry \u2014 one final surprise \u2014 thus sealing our friendship forever. Surprise me and then feed me, that\u2019s all I desire. Cars zoomed by us, precariously close, and we stared at the crooked, gritty facades of buildings in the distance. Yes, there was the chaos of a Pollock painting, but those paintings are gorgeous in their disorder. And Palermo will always be perfect to me no matter what, because that is where I got to spend time with my friend.", "item_type": "Article"}
