In the Wayne Tarrance role, Connerty believes that he\u2019s found his Tom Cruise in Taylor, who\u2019s new to Axe Capital and whose profile as a gender-nonconforming, almond-latte-drinking iconoclast suggests an ideal candidate for flipping. After all, Taylor, similar to Mitch McDeere, hasn\u2019t been part of Axe\u2019s corporate culture for long and thus doesn\u2019t have the loyalties (or blackmail threats) that keep more veteran employees bound to the company. Connerty underestimates Taylor on two fronts: He assumes Taylor will act out of conscience and without leverage, and he assumes Taylor will be disillusioned to learn about what\u2019s going on at Axe Capital. But one of the fascinating things about Taylor \u2014 and about Asia Kate Dillon\u2019s close-to-the-vest performance all season long \u2014 is that few assumptions about the character have been borne out. In the meeting over what to do about the Sandicot disaster, it was Taylor who argued most forcefully for fiscal austerity, taking the pitiless position that the town shouldn\u2019t expect to be bailed out for its mismanagement. And in the latest episode, it\u2019s Taylor who signs the papers justifying Axe\u2019s dubious short position on Klaxon, even though the numbers don\u2019t bear it out. When the smoke clears on the second season, Taylor may turn out to be Axe\u2019s truest prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and disciple, far from the soul-sickened Mitch McDeere type, whose dream job turned into a sequel to \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d Credit the writers for making Taylor a genuinely complex character rather than a number-crunching automaton who doesn\u2019t fit in at the office. Taylor\u2019s decision to sign off on the Klaxon trade reveals some very human character flaws, a willingness to suppress higher values in pursuit of a comfier life. Mitch McDeere wouldn\u2019t allow himself to be so compromised. So welcome to the club, Taylor! It makes sense that Taylor signs on the dotted line in the episode in which Wendy and Lara return to their husbands, because dirty secrets and moral compromise are the bonding agents of \u201cBillions.\u201d The U2 single that inspires the episode\u2019s title, \u201cWithout or Without You\u201d \u2014 and leads us out of the episode \u2014 is a dreamy song about romantic ambivalence, that feeling of being stuck in a relationship that allures, repels and endures. Wendy and Lara both have plenty of reasons to abandon their husbands for good, yet both are drawn back into the life they considered leaving. And it\u2019s not as though anything has changed. They\u2019re not returning to better, more committed and upstanding men. They\u2019re just returning. Let\u2019s start with Lara. After finding out that Axe lied about his business arrangement with Wendy, she leaves a note on his pillow (\u201cYou lied to me\u201d), grabs four $10,000 \u201cbricks\u201d out of the vault, and peels away with their sons to destinations unknown. Axe\u2019s claim that he\u2019s never lied to Lara in 15 years doesn\u2019t scan as entirely true, but it\u2019s not as if Lara ever found his line of work distasteful or ever questioned whether their family deserved the stacks of $10,000 bricks lining its coffers. After all, it was her pitiless judgment that convinced Axe to treat Sandicot harshly, and she\u2019s used to giving her husband\u2019s raging id a lot of latitude. Her exit seemed to be more about blowing off steam than pondering a permanent break. Yet Axe can\u2019t keep his cool about it. One of the consistent pleasures of this second season is that Axe\u2019s bluster and power-plays have revealed weakness as much as cunning. He may know how to play all the angles and turn the screws on his adversaries, but his inability to modulate his behavior leaves him exposed when a more subtle approach is required. His peppering of Lara\u2019s voice mail with invective recalls the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d episode \u201cThe Phone Message,\u201d when George Costanza leaves a series of increasingly angry messages on a woman\u2019s answering machine and then makes an elaborate effort to switch out the cassette. Axe is lucky enough to be able delete his messages off Lara\u2019s iPhone before she ever hears them, but they would have made a bad situation worse \u2014 and perhaps unresolvable. He\u2019s much, much weaker than he appears to be. Wendy\u2019s return is the bigger development. Her absence was longer and the threat of divorce was real. Chuck wins her back through various shows of patience and respect, culminating in a romantic Italian dinner on a night when Wendy needed it most. Chuck informs her of his bid for the governorship, but he\u2019s no more forthcoming to her about his secrets than he is to the investigator Jack Foley hires to dig up the dirt before his opponents do. For her part, Wendy hasn\u2019t disclosed her one-night stand while the two were on a break. (Mary-Louise Parker is perfectly cast in the role, which requires a cocktail of shrewdness and sexuality similar to that needed for her character in \u201cWeeds.\u201d) Nothing fundamental has changed about their relationship during their time apart. The only thing that\u2019s changed is the U2 factor: They realize they can\u2019t live with or without each other. Bulls and Bears \u2022 Chuck\u2019s interrogator runs through a checklist of scandals that have shortened many a political career. (\u201cAborted pregnancies? Unwanted sexual advances in the workplace? Fiscal malfeasances? Hiring of undocumented workers? Cheating? Same-sex exploration? Membership in racially exclusive clubs?\u201d) But the act of taking off her shoes seems to unnerve him more than any question. She knows his weakness long before he reveals it to her. \u2022 Axe\u2019s reference to \u201cMark Felt in the parking garage\u201d brings us one step closer to Deep Throat\u2019s true identity becoming a household name. \u2022 Paul Giamatti uttering the words \u201cIn-a-Gadda-Da-Greena\u201d and \u201cHello Yello\u201d suggests a second career as the world\u2019s most miserable, contemptuous juice vendor. \u2022 Short your Ice Juice futures. If you need some analysis to justify the short, I\u2019d be happy to cook something up.", "abstract": "Contrary to some assumptions, Taylor may turn out to be Axe\u2019s truest prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and disciple."}
