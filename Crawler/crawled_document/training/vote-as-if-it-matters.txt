Sure, as long as you believe two things. First, you have to believe that it makes no difference at all whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump moves into the White House \u2014 because one of them will. Second, you have to believe that America will be better off in the long run if we eliminate environmental regulation, abolish the income tax, do away with public schools, and dismantle Social Security and Medicare \u2014 which is what the Libertarian platform calls for. But do 29 percent of Americans between 18 and 34 believe these things? I doubt it. Yet that, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll, is the share of millennial voters who say that they would vote for Mr. Johnson if the election took place now. And the preponderance of young Americans who say they\u2019ll back Mr. Johnson or Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, appear to be citizens who would support Mrs. Clinton in a two-way race; including the minor party candidates cuts her margin among young voters from 21 points to just 5. So I\u2019d like to make a plea to young Americans: your vote matters, so please take it seriously. Why are minor candidates seemingly drawing so much support this year? Very little of it, I suspect, reflects support for their policy positions. How many people have actually read the Libertarian platform? But if you\u2019re thinking of voting Johnson, you really should. It\u2019s a remarkable document. As I said, it calls for abolition of the income tax and the privatization of almost everything the government does, including education. \u201cWe would restore authority to parents to determine the education of their children, without interference from government.\u201d And if parents don\u2019t want their children educated, or want them indoctrinated in a cult, or put them to work in a sweatshop instead of learning to read? Not our problem. What really struck me, however, was what the platform says about the environment. It opposes any kind of regulation; instead, it argues that we can rely on the courts. Is a giant corporation poisoning the air you breathe or the water you drink? Just sue: \u201cWhere damages can be proven and quantified in a court of law, restitution to the injured parties must be required.\u201d Ordinary citizens against teams of high-priced corporate lawyers \u2014 what could go wrong? It\u2019s really hard to believe that young voters who supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary think any of this is a good idea. But Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein have received essentially no media scrutiny, so that voters have no idea what they stand for. And their parties\u2019 names sound nice: who among us is against liberty? The truth, that the Libertarian Party essentially stands for a return to all the worst abuses of the Gilded Age, is not out there. Meanwhile, of course, it does make a huge difference which of the two realistic prospects for the presidency wins, and not just because of the difference in their temperaments and the degree to which they respect or have contempt for democratic norms. Their policy positions are drastically different, too. True, much of what Mr. Trump says is incoherent: in his policy proposals, trillion dollar tax breaks are here today, gone tomorrow, back the day after. But anyone who calls him a \u201cpopulist\u201d isn\u2019t looking at the general thrust of his ideas, or at whom he has chosen as economic advisers. Mr. Trump\u2019s brain trust, such as it is, is composed of hard-line, right-wing supply-siders \u2014 whom even Republican economists have called \u201ccharlatans and cranks\u201d \u2014 for whom low taxes on the rich are the overwhelming priority. Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton has staked out the most progressive policy positions ever advocated by a presidential candidate. There\u2019s no reason to believe that these positions are insincere, that she would revert to 1990s policies in office: What some are now calling the \u201cnew liberal economics\u201d has sunk deep roots in the Democratic Party, and dominates the ranks of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers. Now, maybe you don\u2019t care. Maybe you consider center-left policies just as bad as hard-right policies. And maybe you have somehow managed to reconcile that disdain with tolerance for libertarian free-market mania. If so, by all means vote for Mr. Johnson. But don\u2019t vote for a minor-party candidate to make a statement. Nobody cares. Remember, George W. Bush lost the popular vote in 2000, but somehow ended up in the White House anyway in part thanks to the Nader vote \u2014 and nonetheless proceeded to govern as if he had won a landslide. Can you really imagine a triumphant Mr. Trump showing restraint out of respect for all those libertarian votes? Your vote matters, and you should act accordingly \u2014 which means thinking seriously about what you want to see happen to America.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T06:00:08-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/opinion/vote-as-if-it-matters.html", "item_type": "Article"}
