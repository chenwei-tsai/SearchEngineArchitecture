{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Two American service members were killed in action Wednesday night in an operation in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the service members were killed in an action targeting the Islamic State in Nangarhar Province. That is the same province where the Pentagon deployed the United States military\u2019s most powerful conventional bomb two weeks ago. That weapon, nicknamed the \u201cmother of all bombs,\u201d targeted Islamic State fighters who were hiding in caves and a tunnel complex. The Defense Department deemed the operation successful, but since then, fighting in the area has continued and the Afghanistan military, supported by the Defense Department, has yet to clear the area of remaining Islamic State fighters. The names of the two service members were not immediately released.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/two-us-service-members-killed-in-afghanistan-pentagon-says.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T10:52:53-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T10:45:43-04:00", "abstract": "They were killed in action targeting the Islamic State in the same region that the United States dropped a powerful bomb this month, a spokesman said.", "title": "2 U.S. Service Members Killed in Afghanistan, Pentagon Says"}
