Al Jackson has experienced it many times. Mr. Jackson, 38, a stand-up comedian who has been touring for more than a decade, has stayed in Red Roof Inns and Wyndham hotels across this land. Inserting his key card can be like a gateway to existential dread. \u201cWhen you open the door, there\u2019s that rush of air, always that same kind of stale smell,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the door shuts behind you. You\u2019re in this semidark room. You drag your bag to where everyone sets their bag and it\u2019s, \u2018How did I get here again?\u2019\u201d The hospitality industry tries its best to counteract this adult version of homesickness. Everything about the guest experience, from the smooth jazz playing in the lobby to the earth-tone d\u00e9cor, is designed to create a veneer of contentment and belonging. But hotel gloom has recently slipped into the cultural conversation nonetheless. First there was \u201cHotels of North America,\u201d a novel published last fall by Rick Moody told in the form of online lodging reviews. Then came \u201cAnomalisa,\u201d the Oscar-nominated animated film written and co-directed by Charlie Kaufman, which centers on a businessman\u2019s stay in an upscale Cincinnati hotel that Tad Friend, writing about the movie in The New Yorker, described as \u201coppressively functional.\u201d (Picture the best Hampton Inn you\u2019ve ever stayed in.) Curiously, both the novel and the movie center on drifting middle-aged motivational speakers. They use the hotel stay as a metaphor for emotional estrangement and societal disconnectedness. It\u2019s a dark night of the soul rendered through free continental breakfasts and nightly turndown service. \u201cI used to stay in this Radisson in New London, Conn.,\u201d Mr. Moody said. \u201cI still have nightmares about the Edward Hopper-esque loneliness.\u201d He spoke of the \u201cdread of the key being demagnetized\u201d and the \u201cmounting anxiety\u201d that \u201cwhatever little shred of home or idea of home that you can carry into that room\u201d will be lost. In this way, Mr. Moody, 54, resembles his novel\u2019s narrator, who, while staying at a La Quinta Inn in Tuscaloosa, Ala., undergoes a \u201cprofound personality change\u201d brought on by the hotel\u2019s \u201cnauseating pastels\u201d and \u201cfaux-Mexican d\u00e9cor.\u201d Perhaps the artistic temperament is not suited to hotel life. The cartoonist Charles M. Schulz told his biographer: \u201cJust the mention of a hotel makes me turn cold. When I\u2019m in a hotel room alone, I worry about getting so depressed I might jump out of a window.\u201d Carol Margolis, 56, has spent 30 years fighting off hotel gloom. She traveled frequently as a consultant for large corporations, once spending so much time on the road that she had a permanent room at a Marriott Residence Inn in Cleveland. Now she advises companies about business travel. For her, Rule No. 1: Never let the gloom gain a foothold. \u201cI was afraid that if it happened once, it would keep happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like one drink and you fall off the wagon.\u201d For Ms. Margolis, who is married and lives in Florida, the problem is not the travel itself. She loves to walk down the jet bridge and board a plane, and the feeling of touching down on a runway a thousand miles from home promises new experiences, new adventures. The challenge comes later in the journey. \u201cWhen you get to the hotel, the movement stops,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m picturing myself standing in the middle of the room, walking in circles asking, \u2018What do I do now?\u2019\u201d In recent years, the better chains have upgraded their designs, adding amenities like spas and fitness centers and making an effort to create a consistent experience across their properties. Yet, paradoxically, the quasi luxury may add to the sense of emptiness. Mr. Jackson sees the midprice chain hotel as a social leveler. Although he is grateful that he doesn\u2019t have to go back to the ratty motels he experienced early in his career, he said he wonders how far he has really come when he finds himself in yet another taupe-carpeted room. \u201cYou fly first class, you\u2019re blue chip at the rental car counter, you go through the platinum rewards member line at the hotel, but you\u2019re still in that same lonely hotel room,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cNo matter how ordered you try to make it, you have chosen a seminomadic lifestyle.\u201d How do seasoned business travelers fight it off? Bill McGowan, 55, the founder and chief executive of Clarity Media Group, a New York-based firm that specializes in media training, said he minimizes the amount of time spent in the room, cutting it down to unpacking, showering and sleeping. Room service is out; instead, he uses the Open Table app to find a restaurant with a lively bar where he can sit and have dinner, and eats there again on successive business trips. Routine can breed comfort, he added. He is on the road eight to 10 days a month and books the same hotels in the same cities. In Silicon Valley, it\u2019s the Westin in Palo Alto, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s so familiar, it\u2019s almost like a home away from home,\u201d Mr. McGowan said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have that horrible realization when I open the door.\u201d Ms. Margolis is also a believer in cutting down on the time spent in the room. Soon after check-in, she seeks a spot where she can work or relax. \u201cI recently stayed at a Marriott Courtyard,\u201d she said, \u201cand they have these bistro lobbies with a fireplace and chairs. Oh, my gosh, I was right there.\u201d Sarah Cloninger, 35, a corporate trainer who writes a travel blog called Road Warriorette, said that fighting the gloom starts with the trip planning. She arranges to be away from her husband and three small children the least amount of time possible. And she tries to book a hotel downtown, within walking distance of shops and restaurants. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to feel bummed when you\u2019re in a Hampton Inn in the middle of nowhere,\u201d she said. Like many business travelers, Ms. Cloninger tends to stay in midprice chain hotels because they are company approved, and because she gets reward points. (She prefers Hilton chains.) But on the rare occasion when she is booked at a five-star hotel, like the time her company held a meeting at the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay in Northern California, the gloom magically disappears. \u201cThe bathroom had marble floors and gorgeous amenities and a separate bathtub,\u201d she said. \u201cI was not sad when I walked into that hotel room.\u201d Mr. Jackson, the comedian, sees an upside in the near silence of those midprice hotels with carpeted hallways and tinted windows that don\u2019t open. \u201cI want my hotel to be kind of sad,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get some work done.\u201d And given his vivid memories of the rundown places he once stayed in, he will take bourgeois melancholy any day. \u201cIt was a motel in Vero Beach, Fla.,\u201d he said. \u201cI walked into the room, and there was a gunshot through the window and ants all over the floor. I called the front desk and told them about the ants. The guy goes, \u2018You can come down here and pick up some spray.\u2019\u201d There is gloom, and then there is gloom.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/fashion/how-to-stay-sane-on-a-business-trip.html", "published_date": "2016-02-29T19:00:00-05:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T17:34:29-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "How to Stay Sane on a Business Trip", "item_type": "Article"}
