After something of a lull \u2014 there were not many new revelations about Uber and no giant breakthrough in artificial intelligence last week \u2014 there is a lot of activity on the horizon. That includes quarterly earnings reports from tech companies such as IBM, Qualcomm and Yahoo this week. Facebook is also holding its annual developer conference starting on Tuesday, an event that typically provides a peek into the future with new technologies. And Samsung is making its new Galaxy S8 smartphone available for sale to the public this week. And that\u2019s just the stuff we know about. Until then, here are a few of our favorite tech stories from New York Times reporters over the weekend: \u2022 How Uber\u2019s drive to dominate the world has run headlong into analog life in India, by Farhad Manjoo. \u2022 New Zealand is using its isolation as a lure to attract coders and engineers, especially at a time of upheaval elsewhere, Jacqueline Williams and David Streitfeld write. \u2022 Slack, the online collaboration start-up, is facing more competition as it grows up, Katie Benner writes. \u2022 And the hotel industry has hatched and is pursuing a plan to thwart Airbnb, Katie Benner writes."}
