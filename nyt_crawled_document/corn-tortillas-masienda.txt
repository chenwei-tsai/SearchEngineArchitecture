These tortillas, made from stone-ground nixtamalized corn, are sold frozen. They may look drab, but the tortillas more than compensate with an earthy, naturally nutty corn flavor that blooms when they are heated. The website also sells dried corn and beans: Masienda Heirloom Corn Tortillas, $3 per package of 12, in lots of six or 12 packages and shipped on Mondays and Wednesdays, Masienda Bodega, masienda.com."}
