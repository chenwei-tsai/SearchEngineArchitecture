The heavy edits came hours before tens of thousands of climate-change activists marched to the White House during a Saturday protest. The agency eliminated EPA.gov pages relating to climate science, projections of the future impacts of human-caused climate change, and descriptions of the Obama administration\u2019s signature climate program, the Clean Power Plan. \u201cOur website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,\u201d said spokesman J.P. Freire. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general, led 14 lawsuits against the agency in his former post. Pruitt made waves in March when he said he is not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change. \u2018\u201cI think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do,\u201d he said on CNBC.\u201dSo no, I would not agree that it\u2019s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.\u201d Screenshots of the Obama administration\u2019s EPA web pages are being archived and can still be found online, the agency noted in a press release.
