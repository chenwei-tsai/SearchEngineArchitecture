Mr. Karl will be wearing a knee brace, and may limp a bit, but should be otherwise fine, according to a spokesman for the show, Adrian Bryan-Brown. Mr. Karl\u2019s performance on Monday night comes at a crucial time for the production, which needs to open before April 27 to maintain its eligibility for Tony awards. And, although most of those in the media reviewing the show have already seen Mr. Karl in the role, the show now needs Tony nominators and, should Mr. Karl be nominated for an award, Tony voters, to be able to see his performance so they can assess it. The actor was injured Friday night during one of the last scheduled previews, before a crowd that included multiple journalists invited to attend as they prepared to write reviews. The production has declined to offer specific details about what happened, but Mr. Karl said on Instagram that he had \u201ctweaked\u201d his knee during what he described as \u201ca poorly landed leap frog.\u201d The production canceled the Saturday matinee and deployed an understudy, Andrew Call, on Saturday night. On Sunday, there were no performances scheduled, so no adjustment was needed. The musical, with a score by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin, is adapted from the 1993 film starring Bill Murray, about a weatherman who relives the same day over and over again. The musical was  presented last year at the Old Vic Theater in London, also with Mr. Karl in the lead role, and last week it won Olivier awards for best new musical and for Mr. Karl\u2019s performance. The show, directed by Matthew Warchus and produced by Whistle Pig, Columbia Live Stage and the Dodgers, is one of the most expensive of the current theater season. It was capitalized for up to $17.5 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission."}
