LACMA, Los Angeles Through May 7, 2017 Both bigger-than-life personalities and arguably the most prominent artists of their respective countries in the early to mid 20th century, Spain's Pablo Picasso and Mexico's Diego Rivera each tapped into ancient traditions to help create modernism. This exhibition of 150 paintings, etchings and watercolors shows both the thread running between the two artists as well as the connections each had with objects from the deep past. The Art Institute Of Chicago Through May 7, 2017 Influential 20th century Brazilian artist H\u00e9lio Oiticica, a leader of the so-called Neo-Concrete Movement, gets his first major American retrospective with To Organize Delirium, a show that debuted at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Art last year, and will move on next to New York's Whitney Museum (July 14-October 1, 2017).

Dallas Museum of Art Through July 16, 2017 In its only American stop, this major international show is a sweeping survey of nearly 200 works that showcase Mexico's cultural and artistic renaissance in the first half of the 20th century, with pieces by the titans of Mexican Modernism and lesser-known pioneers, as well as several rarely-seen works by female artists. Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago Apr 15-Aug 20, 2017 This just-opened show highlights the work of Mexico City-based artist Tania P\u00e9rez C\u00f3rdova, whose pieces turn everyday items like SIM chips and credit cards \u2014 \"contemporary relics,\" as she calls them \u2014 into sculptures.
