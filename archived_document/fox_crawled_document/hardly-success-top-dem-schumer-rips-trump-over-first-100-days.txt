An initial effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare collapsed in the House of Representatives last month. Last week, the administration backed off a demand to provide for a wall along the southern border in a planned $1 trillion-plus spending bill. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Democrats were \"without a leader\" \u2014 an apparent shot at Schumer, the highest-ranking Democrat in Washington \u2014 and had become \"the party of obstruction.\" The president also took aim at Schumer during a rally in Harrisburg, Pa. Saturday night, telling the raucous crowd that the New Yorker was \"weak on crime and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. \"He is a poor leader \u2014 known him a long time \u2014 and he\u2019s leading the Democrats to doom,\" Trump added. Schumer declined to directly answer Trump's words except to say, \"Name-calling doesn't work. Let's look at values. Let's look at issues.\" He also blamed Trump for refusing to work with congressional Democrats. \"On the issue so far \u2014 taxes and health care \u2014 he doesn\u2019t consult us at all,\" Schumer said. \"He puts together a plan that is very hard-right, special interest [and] wealth-oriented and says the way to be bipartisan is to just support his plan. That\u2019s not the way America works.\" The Senate Democratic leader also refused to countenance the idea of repealing ObamaCare, the signature domestic achievment of Trump's predecessor. \"[Republicans] ought to back off repealing Obamacare,\" Schumer said. \"We\u2019ve said over and over again, if [Trump] backs off repeal, we\u2019ll sit down and work with him to improve Obamacare.\"", "time": "2017-04-30T18:45:00.000-04:00"}
