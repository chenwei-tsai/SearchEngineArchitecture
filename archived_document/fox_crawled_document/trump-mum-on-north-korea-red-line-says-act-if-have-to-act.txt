The president said Monday that \u201cnobody\u2019s safe\u201d in the face of Kim Jong Un\u2019s repeated tests of a nuclear weapon and missiles that might someday be able to carry a warhead beyond its borders with South Korea, where U.S. troops are stationed. \u201cWe have 28,000 troops on the line and they're right there,\u201d the president said. \u201cIf he gets the long-range missiles, we're not safe either.\u201d Still, Trump continued to stay mum about what he might do to stop Pyongyang\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapon or what action on North Korea\u2019s part might trigger a military response. \u201cI'm not like President Obama where you draw a red line as you said a red line in the sand and then lots of bad things happen and he never goes over the red line,\u201d Trump said. He called Kim\u2019s recent statements \u201cvery inflammatory\u201d and \u201chorrible,\u201d but suggested he did not want to telegraph possible military action. \u201cI've been pretty well known for saying like nothing when it comes to the military,\u201d Trump said. \u201c\u2026 So when people say well, I was asked the question yesterday, \u2018well I mean exactly when would you go in, at what time would you go in?\u2019 I mean it's ridiculous. I don't want to talk about it.\u00a0I can say this, he\u2019s very threatening, he\u2019s a big threat to the world.\u201d To be sure, Trump acted with little warning last month to order strikes on an airfield held by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, after he used chemical weapons on residents in a country\u2019s years-long civil war. \u201cI actually covered [Obama\u2019s] red line for him in Syria,\u201d Trump said Monday. He also suggested that the Obama administration publicly announcing plans to defeat the Islamic State terror group in the Iraqi city of Mosul turned a projected brief battle into an extended one. \u201cIt's still going on because the enemy knew they were coming,\u201d Trump said. Trump, meanwhile, acknowledged that North Korea is becoming his No. 1 foreign policy concern \u2013 \u201cI think probably, yes,\u201d he said \u2013 while claiming the U.S. is making \u201ctremendous strides\u201d in the separate fight against the Islamic State. \u201cThere's an evil there and we have to solve that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first saw the heads being chopped off I said to myself, \u2018I've never seen that\u2019 \u2026 since medieval times. \u2026 So we have to solve the problem.\u201d Trump, in the Fox News interview, also sounded off on the media. Asked about his oft-repeated charge that some outlets are peddling \u201cfake news,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI'm not talking, not all of the media. I'll tell you just, that is unfair the way they cover me because they say I'm against the media. I'm not against the media; I'm against the fake media.\u201d He continued to claim he can take media criticism when merited. \u201cSo I love the media. I think the media is great. If I do something bad, treat me badly. But they don't tell it like it is,\u201d he said. While the North Korea situation stands as perhaps Trump\u2019s most pressing international concern, he is looking to notch legislative achievements in Washington on health care and tax reform -- two goals that eluded him during his first 100 days. Asked whether he could get health care passed, after an initial bill failed in March, Trump told Bolling, \u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d He said the latest plan, which could come for a vote as early as this week, is an improvement. \u201cThe one mistake I made with the health care. You know, we have one plan that\u2019s going through. It\u2019s been getting better and better and better and someone said \u2018the people voting for Trump aren\u2019t getting good \u2026 they\u2019re gonna get the greatest!\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese are the greatest people. We\u2019re either gonna have a great plan or I\u2019m not signing it. And I\u2019ve said from day one, the best thing I could do is let ObamaCare die and then come in with a plan.\u201d", "time": "2017-05-01T17:00:00.000-04:00"}
