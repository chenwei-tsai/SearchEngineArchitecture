How that gets executed or whether that goes anywhere is a different story,\u201d Priebus said, adding that the media needs to be \u201cmore responsible with how they report news.\u201d Priebus\u2019 comments came after President Trump railed against the media Sunday at his Pennsylvania rally to celebrate his first 100 days in office. Trump said the media deserved a \u201cfailing grade.\u201d Trump also jabbed the New York Times, claiming that the paper\u2019s poor finances forced to shrink its print edition. \u201cThe paper's getting smaller and smaller. Did you ever notice? It's starting to look like a comic book.\u201d Trump said. Trump had previously warned about changing libel laws during a February 2016 campaign rally in Texas. Then, he warned The New York Times and The Washington Post that they could possibly be sued. \"When they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\" Trump said at that rally. He later told Fox News that he \u201cloves\u201d the free press, but \u201cwe ought to open up the libel laws, and I'm going to do that.\"", "time": "2017-05-01T01:21:00.000-04:00"}
