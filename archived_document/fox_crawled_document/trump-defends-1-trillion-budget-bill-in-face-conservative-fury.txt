He added a warning shot: \"Our country needs a good 'shutdown' in September to fix mess!\" Republican and Democratic lawmakers made the budget deal, announced Monday, in order to fund the government through September and avoid a shutdown later this week. But despite Republicans controlling the House, Senate and White House, the deal is widely perceived as benefiting Democratic interests and priorities, while sidelining some of the items on Trump's wishlist. Heritage Action, an outside conservative group, on Tuesday urged a \"no\" vote on the package, with Heritage Foundation analysts claiming it \"woefully fails the test of fiscal responsibility and does not advance important conservative policies.\" The plan has no funding for Trump\u2019s much vaunted border wall, though it includes $1.5 billion for border security. While the deal does include an increase in military spending as requested by Trump, it does not reduce funding for so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2013 jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal immigration law \u2013 and continues to fund abortion provider Planned Parenthood. Non-defense spending also sees an increase, and Democrats managed to kill 160 Republican riders on issues such as environmental regulations. The deal also includes a $2 billion increase in spending for the National Institutes of Health. At a White House ceremony to award a trophy to the Air Force football team, Trump again hailed parts of the deal, saying it secured the \"single largest increase in border security funding in 10 years\" and noted that it broke the Obama-era \"parity rule\" -- that every increase in military spending must be matched by an increase in domestic spending. \"That's not happening any more, I can tell you...you're going to have the money we need and the equipment we need,\"\u00a0he said. \"Our military is going to be taken care of, that I promise you.\" But Democrats reacted with glee to a supposed victory pulled out of the embers of a brutal November election defeat. \u201cI think we had a strategy and it worked,\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans in the House and Senate were closer to one another than Republicans were to Donald Trump.\u201d Conservatives took to media outlets and TV to express their anger, aimed particularly at congressional Republicans and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \u201cDEMS CELEBRATE 'REPUBLICAN' BUDGET!\u201d declared the top headline on the Drudge Report Tuesday morning, accompanied by a grinning picture of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Another headline read: \u201cMORE PAGES THAN OBAMA STIMULUS\u201d \u201cWe do not have a Republican Party on Capitol Hill that can get its act together,\u201d Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham said on \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you would carry water for this,\" conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said Monday. \"Not that I want to; don\u2019t misunderstand. I\u2019m just coming up with new ways to explain what a sellout, disaster, betrayal \u2014 whatever you want to call this \u2014 it is.\" At a House GOP leadership press conference Tuesday morning, however, Speaker Ryan and other top Republicans defended the package. Ryan touted the \u201cdown payment on border security\u201d and dismissed what he called Democrats\u2019 \u201cPR machine\u201d playing up their end of the bargain. \u201cDon\u2019t look at the press releases, look at the bill,\u201d Ryan said, adding there are \u201ca lot of conservative wins here.\u201d Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., touted pay raises for military service members and cuts to \u201careas where we\u2019ve seen government run out of control\u201d like the EPA. Members of the House Freedom Caucus predicted conservative opposition in Congress. \"Money goes to Planned Parenthood, as you said. Money continues to go to sanctuary cities, but no money for the border wall,\" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in an interview with CNN. \"I think you're going to see a lot of conservatives against this plan this week.\" Even before Trump\u2019s tweets, some Republicans looked to defend the bill. They noted that Trump got the defense spending priorities he asked for, while pointing to other victories such as no new money for Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid program, a 50 percent increase for abstinence education, increased funding in the fight against opioid addiction, and another cut for the EPA\u2019s budget. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer noted that the deal includes $1.5 billion secured for enhanced border security and detention capabilities, and called it a \u201cdown payment\u201d on the border wall, which he reiterated is going to get built during Trump\u2019s time in office. \"Make no mistake, the wall is going to be built,\" he said. \"We have five months left in this fiscal year, we're getting $1.52 billion for border security, there's a lot that can be done with that.\" But some conservatives say passing a bill funding Democratic priorities will hurt Republicans down the road in the 2018 midterms. \u201cI find this to be so demoralizing, disappointing and I think they\u2019re going to have hell to pay for this budget,\u201d Ingraham said. The bill is expected to go to the House floor Wednesday, and to the Senate Thursday, ahead of the shutdown deadline on Friday.
