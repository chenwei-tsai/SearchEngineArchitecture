The president made the comments in an interview with The Washington Examiner\u2019s Salena Zito. He dived into Civil War history after citing comparisons between his and Jackson\u2019s campaign for the presidency, describing that race as \u201cnasty\u201d and calling Jackson a \u201cswashbuckler.\u201d Appearing to cast Jackson as a dealmaker like himself, he propounded a thought exercise: \"I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was \u2026 a very tough person, but he had a big heart,\" Trump said. \"And he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this.'\" He added, \"People don't realize, you know, the Civil War \u2026 if you think about it, why? People don't ask that question, but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?\" During his presidency, Jackson confronted South Carolina secession threats and in doing so helped preserve the union, temporarily. But Jackson died in 1845, 16 years before the start of the Civil War \u2013 which was driven largely by the clash over slavery and other issues. Set to air on SiriusXM, Trump's comments questioning the reasons for the war touched off a social media frenzy on Monday, with Chelsea Clinton among others seeking to answer the president\u2019s question. \u201c1 word answer: Slavery. Longer: When Andrew Jackson died in 1845 (16 yrs before the Civil War began), he owned 150 men, women and children,\u201d Clinton wrote.", "time": "2017-05-01T10:58:00.000-04:00"}
