The Trump campaign lashed out after it said CNN refused to run an advertisement highlighting Trump\u2019s accomplishments during his first 100 days in the White House. \u201cIt is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country,\u201d Trump campaign Executive Director Michael Glassner said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that CNN is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesn\u2019t fit their narrative.\u201d CNN, however, said its decision not to air the Trump ad came down to simple editorial discretion. \u201cCNN requested that the advertiser remove the false graphic that says the mainstream media is \u2018fake news,\u2019\u201d the network said in a statement issued from its public relations Twitter account. \u201cThe mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false. Per out policy, it will be accepted only if that graphic is deleted. Those are the facts.\u201d At issue is a one-second portion of the 30-second video which shows the words \u201cFake News\u201d in red letters over a five-way split-screen of various media personalities: CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell and Rachel Maddow, ABC\u2019s George Stephanopolous and CBS\u2019 Scott Pelley. The rest of the ad shows clips, such as Trump signing executive orders and Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch being sworn in, as overlays tout gains in jobs, reductions in regulations and other legislative victories. Trump has had an, at best, uneasy relationship with CNN, a network he\u2019s frequently referred to as \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 and once even downgraded to \u201cvery fake news\u201d during a presidential news conference. Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer have also engaged in numerous contentious back-and-forths with CNN correspondents.", "time": "2017-05-02T12:03:00.000-04:00"}
