No one wants the government to shut down. But there\u2019s no deal yet. House Republicans are determined to take another stab at repealing and replacing ObamaCare. A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and a senior White House aide wouldn\u2019t rule out a vote this week, though that\u2019s unlikely. But there\u2019s no deal yet. The reality is: health care can wait a bit. The government is only flush with cash through 11:59:59 p.m. ET Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that we are 72 hours before shutting down the government and we haven\u2019t reached an agreement,\u201d complained House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md. Just over the weekend, Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the Trump administration was \u201casking for our priorities.\u201d But Mulvaney conceded that \u201cwe don\u2019t know yet\u201d if the president will insist that Congress include funding for a border wall in the spending bill. Then came signals from the White House that President Trump wasn\u2019t backing down on the wall \u2013 but said the wall wasn\u2019t essential for this spending round. \u201cHe is showing reasonableness on the wall,\u201d declared White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus about his boss. \u201cHe has put [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi, D-Calif., and Hoyer back on their heels. His willingness to compromise on wall funding is a surprise to Democrats.\u201d Democrats may be surprised. But the president needs Democrats more than they need him. There\u2019s more to be settled to fund the government. Democrats may cede some $15 billion in money for the military in an effort to protect subsidies for low-income ObamaCare beneficiaries which the president threatened to nix. Remaining on the table is a solution to covering the health benefits of miners and even shoring up a Medicare shortfall in Puerto Rico. But it\u2019s now Wednesday. There\u2019s still no bill text of the interim spending bill. Negotiators are starting to run out of racetrack. In 1995, President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., stumbled into the first of three government shutdowns, partly because they ran out of time. The way to avert a shutdown Friday night is to pass a stopgap spending bill known as a continuing resolution or CR. Such an approach could fund the government for a few days or a week. \u201cI don\u2019t want to start talking about a short-term CR on Tuesday,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to reach an agreement to keep the government funded until September.\u201d And what about the wall campaign promise? \u201cWhat Mr. Trump says is a wall will be a wall,\u201d said one member of the House GOP leadership. But what about the bricks and mortar and trowels for that wall? One senior Senate source said the wall would be brick in some places and a fence in others. An \u201celectronic frontier\u201d would surveil a few spots. Drones would maintain the others, and even blimps. You thought Mexico was going to pay for it. Try Goodyear. If Congress and Trump can avoid a government shutdown this week, House Republicans hope to move their version of health care reform next week. But it\u2019s not clear that\u2019s ready to go. \u201cThat narrative that [Trump] needs to pass some piece of legislation in the first 100 days is an unrealistic standard,\u201d said Priebus. The 100-day temporal marker for the Trump presidency hits Saturday. Tuesday night, Republicans bandied updated health care language. Several conservatives signaled their support this week. The question is whether the revamped plan fixes one problem and breaks another. In other words, did the GOP successfully court conservatives but lose moderates? The updated language gives states which expanded Medicare the chance to opt out of ObamaCare when it comes to providing \u201cessential\u201d health services under insurance plans. Deeming more medical procedures as \u201cessential\u201d drives up premiums. One GOP source said moderate Republicans who represent Medicare expansion states should support the changes because their governors will never back certifying fewer benefits as \u201cessential.\u201d But a skeptic pointed out that those governors would not always be governor. So, anything could happen in the future. A conservative House member with strong reservations about the bill conceded to Fox that the retrenched plan \u201cmay be the best we can get.\u201d The Republican lawmaker admitted the new blueprint truly didn\u2019t \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare \u2013 the GOP\u2019s campaign mantra since 2010. Ironically, the thought is some Republicans may be willing to vote yes for the reworked bill so long as it isn\u2019t portrayed as repealing and replacing ObamaCare. In other words, the GOP said it would repeal and replace ObamaCare. It failed to do so. But this could be only thing lawmakers could conceivably approve. So, the bill\u2019s supporters simply wouldn\u2019t portray it as such. And you thought the marijuana smoke-in on the Capitol steps was on Monday \u2026 Late Tuesday, Ryan swore-in the newest House member, Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan. Estes won a special election two weeks ago to succeed Mike Pompeo in Congress. Pompeo resigned earlier this year to become CIA director. Estes\u2019s family huddled in Ryan\u2019s ceremonial office off the House floor for a photo-op engineered to look like the swearing-in before heading to the House floor. That\u2019s where Ryan actually swore-in Estes as a member of Congress. \u201cWe do the fake one first and then the real one,\u201d Ryan instructed Estes. That two-step is a lot like how things have been on Capitol Hill lately. The fake one first and then the real one later. First a demand to fund the wall. Then no demand. On health care, Republicans tried one version of the bill before yanking it off the floor last month. Leaders promise to try again soon. But will the next one be the real one? We don\u2019t know.
