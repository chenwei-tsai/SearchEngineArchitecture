Clinton specifically cited the letter from Comey late in the campaign saying agents were looking into possible new information related to Clinton\u2019s secret, homebrewed computer server. She was ultimately never charged with a crime, and Comey cleared Clinton on the Sunday before the election. She also mentioned WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy website which some analysts believe to be connected to Russia and which posted the hacked emails of Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta. \u201cI was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey\u2019s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but were scared off,\u201d Clinton said at the Women for Women International Conference. She added: \"If the election were on October 27, I'd be your president.\" But those presidential aspirations seem to be a thing of the past for Clinton, who said, however, that she wasn't getting out of politics entirely. \"I\u2019m now back to being an activist citizen, and part of the resistance,\" she said. Clinton said she was writing a book about her experience as the 2016 Democratic nominee. \u201cIt is a painful process reliving the campaign,\u201d she said. Clinton, the first female presidential candidate of a major party, said her election \u201cwould have been a really big deal.\u201d \u201cThere were important messages that could have sent,\u201d Clinton said. Taking a hit at Trump, Clinton said the president should worry less about the election \"and my winning the popular vote.\" Moderator Christiane\u00a0Amanpour at one point asked Clinton if she was a victim of misogyny, to which she replied, \u201cYes I do think it played a role. And I think as we learn more and more about unprecedented foreign interference from a foreign leader who is not in my fan club.\u201d", "time": "2017-05-02T14:37:00.000-04:00"}
