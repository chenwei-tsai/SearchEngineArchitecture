There were no hors d\u2019oeuvres or cocktails at Trump\u2019s rally in Harrisburg, Pa., where the president rallied his supporters and mocked the media \u2013 even as they patted themselves on the back and made lame jokes about him. He held a big rally in Pennsylvania where he actually mocked the event and slammed some of these biased journalists who attended the fancy event 120 miles south, patting themselves on the back. \u201cA large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cThey are gathered together for the White House Correspondents' Dinner without the president. And I cannot possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from Washington's swamp spending my evening with all of you and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people.\u201d Then, this zinger on the heels of the media\u2019s critical evaluations of his first 100 days in office: \u201cIf the media's job is to be honest and tell the truth, then I think we would all agree the media deserves a very, very big fat failing grade!\u201d he said. President Trump skipped the Correspondents' Dinner for good reason. They don't like him, and they showed it once again by lashing out at the commander-in-chief. \u201cWe cannot ignore the rhetoric that has been employed by the president about who we are and what we do., said Jeff Mason, a Reuters White House correspondent and president of the organization. \u201cWe are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.\u201d Alleged comedian Hasan Minhaj gave a cringe-worthy performance that could only draw laughs from a press that hates Trump. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to address the elephant that's not in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cThe leader of our country is not here, and that's because he lives in Moscow. It is a very long flight. \u201cThere also was another elephant in the room, but Donald Trump, Jr. shot it and cut off his tail.\u201d Given the smears and so-called jokes, why exactly was Trump supposed to be at this dinner? The elitist, alt-left media was insulted that our president didn\u2019t come to endure their abuse. \u201cDonald Trump couldn't take the heat, so he got out of the kitchen,\u201d said one commentator. \u201cHe avoided getting roasted at the White House Correspondents' Dinner last night.\u201d Trump instead met with the American people who elected him, and CNN\u2019s Paul Begala thinks he knows why. \u201cHe needs this affirmation from his base because he's a moral midget and he is a deeply insecure person,\u201d Begala said. The mainstream media utterly despises President Trump. It's dripping from every word they say. They can't stand him or anybody else, like me, who dares agree with him and supports him. But President Trump is not going to sit back and let these attacks go unchallenged. He's going to call out the media's extreme bias, including right to their faces. That\u2019s just what he did to CBC News\u2019 John Dickerson Sunday. \u201cYou know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out -- you know, which we call the mainstream media, which sometimes, I must say, is you,\u201d Trump said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cBut when the -- \u201cYou mean me, personally or \u2013\u201c Dickerson protested. \u201cWell, your show,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI love your show. I call it \u2018Deface the Nation.\u2019\" Now that\u2019s the kind of humor the rest of America can laugh at.
