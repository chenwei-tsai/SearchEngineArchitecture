WILL GOP WAGER HOUSE CONTROL ON TRUMPCARE Falstaff says that \u201cthe better part of valor is discretion.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then the spending plan that Congress coughed up just before 10 p.m. ET Sunday night is valorous indeed. It was so discreet, it\u2019s almost like they didn\u2019t want anybody to know that they were passing it\u2026 Republicans realized that even a brief partial government shutdown would have been a calamity for a party with total control of Washington. Being eager to move on to more enjoyable things than stopgap spending, President Trump and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill threw in the towel. And that may prove to be either a strategic retreat to mount a more impressive advance. Or, it could be the beginning of a rout. That will substantially depend on what happens with the third incarnation of TrumpCare now being touted as riding a rocket ship toward passage in the House. In a Sunday morning interview with CBS News, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus predicted that TrumpCare 3.0 \u201cwill be one of the fastest pieces of signature legislation to go through for a president since [Franklin Roosevelt].\u201d But that promise for new deal-style speed seems to be in conflict with what Priebus\u2019 boss who told Fox News\u2019 Eric Bolling in an interview that will air today at 5 p.m. ET that he might walk away from a plan that isn\u2019t good for Trump\u2019s blue-collar political base. \u201cWe\u2019re either gonna have a great plan, or I\u2019m not signing it,\u201d the president said. This would seem to suggest that there are some, um, disagreements present. The legislation that is due up for a vote as soon as Wednesday would be even less generous with subsidies and guarantees for working-class Americans. The same goes for the hanging question about insurance for individuals with preexisting conditions. Trump on Sunday told CBS News that the plan would \u201cbeautifully\u201d deal with individuals who prior to ObamaCare could not get coverage in the normal insurance market. Trump said that the legislation is \u201cchanging\u201d and will have \u201cguarantees\u201d for coverage of those with preexisting conditions. \u201cI mandate it,\u201d Trump said. The change to the law would have to be pretty significant since the last version circulated would allow states to opt out of the preexisting condition requirement. And many states would be tempted to do so since the requirement proves hugely expensive for insurers and has been a massive driver of rate increases since 2010. Your takeaway here, though, is that as we hear promises of momentum on TrumpCare once again, we hear the same confusion we did the first two times around. It\u2019s hard to imagine why the dozens of vulnerable House Democrats from more-moderate suburban districts would want to take such a substantial political risk on legislation that started as unpopular and only gotten worse, especially when their president suggests he might kill the whole thing in the end, anyway. It was said that the reason that the White House rolled out the first draft of the new GOP tax plan was that Team Trump had learned a lesson from the botched health insurance law. It would seem not. House leaders still have no incentive to call a vote for a bill that can\u2019t pass. The relationship between members and leaders has as a core principle the idea that the leaders don\u2019t ask the members to walk the plank on doomed legislation. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi never learned that lesson and made Democratic defeat in 2010 even worse than necessary by forcing House Democrats to cast votes on global warming legislation even though it was already declared dead in the Senate. This is starting to look increasingly like that debacle, and rank-and-file House members know it. Sunday\u2019s short-term spending package cleared the table so Republicans can focus on more pressing concerns. Faced with a looming deadline and a politically disastrous outcome, they opted not to fight. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that that\u2019s where Republicans are going to eventually end up on ObamaCare: bailing out insurance companies and extending subsidies this fall and making no substantive changes to the law. And if they use their legislative reboot bought at the price of a porky, aimless spending package to just stumble on TrumpCare again, that\u2019s exactly where they will end up. THE RULEBOOK: ONCE UPON A TIME\u2026  \u201cIt should not be forgotten that a disposition in the State governments to encroach upon the rights of the Union is quite as probable as a disposition in the Union to encroach upon the rights of the State governments.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 31  TIME OUT: IT\u2019S GONNA BE MAY Smithsonian: \u201cMay Day under King Henry VIII was a time of celebration and revelry. For 16th-century Londoners, it marked both the start of summer and the Feast of St. Joseph the Laborer. They\u2019d drink and carouse all night before, then decorate the city with green boughs and spend the day watching plays about Robin Hood, outlaw and hero of the everyman. But in 1517, the usually festive day turned fearful. Over 1,000 angry citizens rampaged the city; within days, hundreds were arrested and more than a dozen were executed, their bodies displayed on gibbets. A cherished festival day had become violent\u2014and all because London workers claimed foreigners were stealing their jobs. In the months leading up to what would come to be called the Evil May Day riots, a palpable sense of tension grew in the city. There was an ongoing economic downturn.\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions. TRUMP \u2018HONORED\u2019 TO MEET KIM UNDER \u2018RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES\u2019 Bloomberg: \u201cPresident Donald Trump said he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un amid heightened tensions\u2026 \u2018If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,\u2019 Trump said Monday in an interview with Bloomberg News. \u2026 North Korea has become the most urgent national security threat and foreign policy issue facing Trump as his first 100 days in office passed. Kim\u2019s regime has continued development of its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile program in defiance of international condemnation and sanctions. Kim has never met with a foreign leader since taking charge after his father\u2019s death in 2011 and hasn\u2019t left his isolated country. \u2018Most political people would never say that,\u2019 Trump said of his willingness to meet with the reclusive Kim, \u2018but I\u2019m telling you under the right circumstances I would meet with him. We have breaking news.\u2019\u201d Trump invites Filipino strongman Duterte to White House -\u00a0NYT: \u201cPresident Trump on Saturday invited the president of the\u00a0Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to the White House, embracing an authoritarian leader who is accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug suspects\u2026\u201d Buuuuuttt... Duterte may snub -\u00a0AFP: \u201cPhilippine President\u00a0Rodrigo Duterte said Monday he may turn down an invitation by Donald Trump to visit the United States, as he welcomed three Chinese warships to his home town.\u00a0Duterte, who has loosened the Philippines' long alliance with the United States while strengthening ties with China and Russia, said he could not commit to the American president because of a busy schedule that included a trip to Moscow.\u201d TRUMP OPEN TO GAS TAX HIKE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE CASH Bloomberg: \u201cPresident Donald Trump said he\u2019s willing to raise the U.S. gas tax to fund infrastructure development and called the tax-overhaul plan he released last week the beginning of negotiations. \u2018It\u2019s something that I would certainly consider,\u2019 Trump said Monday in an interview with Bloomberg News in the Oval Office, describing the idea as supported by truckers \u2018if we earmarked money toward the highways.\u2019 Trump released a tax\u00a0plan\u00a0on April 26 that would cut the maximum corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent. The same reduced rate would apply to partnerships and other \u2018pass-through\u2019 businesses. He said he is willing to lose provisions of his tax plan in negotiations with Congress but refused to specify which parts. He also repeated his call for a \u201creciprocal tax,\u201d which would be aimed at imposing levies on imports to match the rates that each country charges on U.S. exports.\u201d SCOREBOARD Trump net job-approval rating:\u00a0-8.2 points Change from one week ago:\u00a0+4 points PLAY-BY-PLAY Trump airs first campaign ad for 2020 re-election bid - WaPo N.Y. state lawmakers introduce a bill to release Trump\u2019s tax returns - AP Trump says he will choose from same list of names for second SCOTUS pick -\u00a0WashTimes Trump on Obama wiretapping claim: \u2018I don't stand by anything\u2019 -\u00a0Politico Controversial Trump advisor on Islamism Sebastian Gorka said to be leaving White House -\u00a0WashEx After firing up N.H.

And it is life-threatening trouble for lots of people, potentially.\u201d \u2013 Trump said in an interview with WashEx when reflecting on decisions that the president must make that involve life and death. FROM THE BLEACHERS \u201cYour erudition is delightful. I, also, am a major fan of Bonhoeffer\u2019s writings and personal courage of his convictions, and I am also a one who thinks that the major mistake of the capital \u2018C\u2019 Church was, indeed, its alignment with the Roman Empire, no matter which direction that moved. The Church grew when it was not a part of the earthly power system, and has struggled ever since. As much as I admire Dostoevsky\u2019s Christianity, unless \u2018The Grand Inquisitor\u2019 is tongue in cheek, he, was wrong.\u201d \u2013 Rev. John Johnson, Tucson, Ariz.  [Ed. note: However delightful you find my erudition, Rev. Johnson, it\u2019s a hodgepodge at best, especially when it comes to ecclesiastical history. But I do know enough to say that the periods of growth and devotion we have seen through time have not much coincided with the application of governmental force on its behalf. Augustine, it seems, knew this well, and so, obviously, did Bonhoeffer.] \u201cYour characterization of the direction of President Trump's decisions in his first 100 days as \u2018normality\u2019 stunned me -- not because you're in any way inaccurate, but because you eschewed the ugly neologism \u2018normalcy\u2019 in favor of its literate, though seldom used, alternative. It's nice to know that there's at least one other linguistic fussbudget in America.\u201d \u2013 Bob Foys, Chicago [Ed. note: We would have to blame Warren Harding for that one, I guess\u2026 I don\u2019t always succeed in choosing the right words, but I certainly know the ones that hit me wrong. \u2018Normalcy\u2019 seems to have sprung up sometime in the middle of the 19th century, and like many unnecessary American words has a pseudo-scientific or at least more businesslike sound about it. But I suppose compared to similarly annoying expressions of the current day \u2013 \u2018impact\u2019 as a verb, \u2018bandwidth\u2019 and, God help us, \u2018synergize\u2019 \u2013 \u2018normalcy\u2019 wasn\u2019t so bad.] \u201cAfter reading your report on ignorance, and your expressed concern for developing citizenship in our youth, I wanted to reassure you. I am just returned from two days of leader development at our D-Bar-A Scout Ranch in Michigan. The Boy Scouts of America are alive and well, and developing citizenship steadily. \u2026 At this training, I was heartened to see seven Scout leaders I had the pleasure to build up over the last ten years serving diligently as training staff. They are giving forward what was given to them. \u2026The Republic will prosper and grow.\u00a0 These youth leaders are prepared. Stop by any of our Scout camps. Friday evening bonfire at summer camp should not be missed.\u201d \u2013 Don McGaffey, Redford, Mich. [Ed. note: Here, here, Mr. McGaffey! It is very easy to despair about the future given the current level of discourse in America. But it never fails that when I see what commitment, vigor and passion so many young people in organizations like yours are doing, I\u2019m always encouraged. And that even goes for millennials, who I think have gotten a bad rap on the whole. Thank you and your colleagues for raising up a new generation that not only understands the American creed but can be a good custodian of it.] Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0 HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown. SANDWICHES, IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN\u2019T DO? KCRA: \u201cTypically on Sundays, [Ellen Meharey] attends church then walks her two dogs, Joey and Bella. \u2018I wanted to get something to eat before I took the dogs out,\u2019 said Ellen Meharey. \u2026 While making that sandwich, Meharey says she heard a screech and then a bang. She looked outside and saw a truck lying on its side in her front yard. It scrunched the hood of her car, struck her wheelchair ramp and knocked off her railing. \u2026 Then, she took a moment to think. She could have been standing in that exact spot with her dogs if it was not for that sandwich. \u2018I either would have been out in the street, or I would have been just coming down the ramp,\u2019 said Meharey. \u2018And I would have probably gotten killed.\u2019 She remains thankful she switched up her Sunday routine and grateful she lives where she lives.\u201d Chris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Brianna McClelland\u00a0contributed to this report.
