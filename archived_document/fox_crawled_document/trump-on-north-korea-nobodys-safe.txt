As Trump weighs his options for trying to blunt Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear advancements, Bolling asked how safe U.S. troops along the demilitarized zone and South Korea allies are at this time. \u201cNobody's safe. I mean, who's safe? The guy's got nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI'd like to say they're very safe. These are great brave solders, these are great brave troops and they know the situation. We have 28,000 troops on the line and they're right there. And so nobody's safe. We're probably not safe over here.\u201d Trump added, \u201cIf he gets the long-range missiles, we're not safe either.\u201d WATCH THE PREMIERE OF \u2018THE FOX NEWS SPECIALISTS\u2019 MONDAY AT 5 P.M. ET. The Trump administration, Congress and the international community continue to consider multiple options for cooling the tensions with North Korea, not the least of which is Trump\u2019s bid to court China to exert pressure on Pyongyang. On Capitol Hill, the House plans to debate and vote on a new North Korea sanctions bill early this week. Trump and his advisers have indicated that military action is not off the table, though. While the North Korea situation stands as perhaps Trump\u2019s most pressing international concern, he is looking to notch legislative achievements in Washington on health care and tax reform -- two goals that eluded him during his first 100 days. Asked whether he could get health care passed, after an initial bill failed in March, Trump told Bolling, \u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d He said the latest plan, which could come for a vote as early as this week, is an improvement. \u201cThe one mistake I made with the health care. You know, we have one plan that\u2019s going through. It\u2019s been getting better and better and better and someone said \u2018the people voting for Trump aren\u2019t getting good \u2026 they\u2019re gonna get the greatest!\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese are the greatest people. We\u2019re either gonna have a great plan or I\u2019m not signing it. And I\u2019ve said from day one, the best thing I could do is let ObamaCare die and then come in with a plan.\u201d", "time": "2017-05-01T12:11:00.000-04:00"}
