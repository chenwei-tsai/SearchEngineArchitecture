Jones, 67, has taught most of his more than 5,000 students over the last decade in churches across Oklahoma. What\u2019s more, he weaves biblical passages into his talks about how to handle a gun, and the legal fallout that can follow discharging a weapon in self-defense. Church values and self-defense, Jones says, are not contradictory. Jones says that being a church-goer and a person of strong spiritual values does not mean refusing to strike back when one\u2019s life is threatened. He notes that Psalm 144 says: \u201cBlessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle.\u201d \u201cWe will turn the other cheek,\u201d Jones told Fox News. \u201cI\u2019m the least likely guy to pull out a gun in a fight. But we will not turn the other cheek if you\u2019re going to assault my family or cut off my head in the process.\u201d Jones\u2019 certification course takes eight hours and includes lectures that cover handling a weapon, Oklahoma laws regarding gun ownership and shooting in self-defense, practice at the instructor\u2019s private range and a 15-question exam. Jones says that while people should not go looking for trouble, they should be ready when it looks for them. He cites the case of a woman in his state who was killed by two pit bulls last month, and another woman who was fatally stabbed at a food distribution center in 2014 by a coworker who had been fired. If they had been armed, Jones says, they would likely be alive today. \u201cIf they\u2019d had a legal gun and been trained to use it,\u201d Jones said, referring to the woman who was stabbed, \u201ccan you imagine what went through her mind the last few minutes of her life?\u201d His former students, who have included lawmakers, lawyers and spouses of police officers, have praised his course. One student, Wendy Johnson, took Jones\u2019 course after a friend was mugged. \u201cOne day, my co-worker did not show up for work,\u201d Johnson told WQAD. \u201cSomeone had attacked her in a parking lot and had literally beaten her face. I don\u2019t want to see anyone else in the ER with a swollen face because someone hit them in the head for their purse.\u201d Jones stresses that he is not a pastor, a misperception some have when they learn of his style of sprinkling biblical teachings in his lectures. But some students have actually grown interested in religion after listening to the verses, he said. One of the most important things he tries to teach his students is how to avoid being jailed after firing in self-defense. He tells his students not to consent to a police officer\u2019s request to search their property. \u201cYou show the officer respect,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you never consent. You have to articulate that you were the victim, but you say, \u2018With all due respect, you will have my full cooperation after I seek my legal counsel.\u201d Jones has his critics, to be sure. He has been accused of using the Bible to make money. \u201cPeople say, \u2018You\u2019re getting rich by using God\u2019s name,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just one little guy. Do I make a little money? Yes. But I\u2019m not doing this to get rich.\u201d", "time": "2017-05-01T12:54:00.000-04:00"}
