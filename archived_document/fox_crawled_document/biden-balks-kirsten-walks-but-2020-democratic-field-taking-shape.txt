Among them, former Vice President Joe Biden has denied plans to run after giving mixed signals. \u201cGuys, I am not running,\u201d Biden said last weekend at a sold-out New Hampshire Democratic fundraiser. The 74-year-old Biden -- who has a colorful history keeping his political story alive -- made the announcement after gleefully telling reporters days after Donald Trump\u2019s stunning November 2016 win over Democrats: \"I am going to run in 2020. \u2026 What the hell man.\" Even the shortlist of Democratic senators potentially eyeing the job is long, with Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota being mentioned. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran for president last year as a Democrat, continues to stay on the national stage. But he would be 79 in 2020. Warren and Franken, in particular, took advantage of the recently televised Senate confirmation hearings on Trump appointees to increase their national profile with tough-talking soundbites. \u201cIt's going to be open season,\u201d Douglas Smith, a managing partner at Kent Strategies who worked on campaigns for Al Gore and both Clintons, told Fox News on Tuesday. \u201cElizabeth Warren started running six weeks before Hillary Clinton lost.\u201d Another potential prospect, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, on Monday appeared to take herself out of the mix, telling cable Spectrum News: \u201cI'm focused entirely on running for Senate, so yes, I'm ruling it out.\" With real estate magnate and former reality TV host Trump winning as a first-time candidate, a few names from the entertainment and entrepreneurial worlds also have voiced interest. Among them are Kanye West, the rapper-producer who first announced his 2020 interests in a 2015 MTV awards show and more recently in an August 2016 BBC interview. \u201cWhen I've talked about the idea of being president, I'm not saying I have any political views,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cI don't have views on politics. I just have a view on humanity, on people, on the truth.\u201d Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and \u201cShark Tank\u201d host, has become the face under the familiar headline, \u201cWon\u2019t rule out a presidential run.\u201d The 58-year-old Cuban has for years toyed with the idea, last month telling Five Thirty Eight\u2019s Nate Silver, \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on that,\u201d then telling The Washington Post he had no interest \u201cbut at the same time, sometimes you got to do what you got to do.\u201d Cuban has hinted about running as either a Democrat or Republican, but campaigned with Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, and has criticized former friend Trump and his policies. \u201cI know Mark Cuban well,\u201d Trump responded once on Twitter. \u201cHe backed me big-time, but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls. He's not smart enough to run for president!\u201d Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea, has also been briefly mentioned as a long-shot candidate. David Payne, a Republican strategist and president of Codavate, told Fox News on Tuesday that voters in presidential elections historically vote to one extreme, then the other, with Trump in 2016 being the \u201cyear of the wildcard\u201d or at least of the anti-establishment candidate. \u201cIn politics, the pendulum never stops in the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cPolls show those who voted for President Trump are largely happy with their pick, which might lead us to believe there are some more openings at least in 2018 in the House and Senate. But it\u2019s too early to know about 2020.\u201d The potential field also includes a list of high-profile governors including Colorado\u2019s John Hickenlooper, New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo and Virginia\u2019s Terry McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee leader and prolific fundraiser whose trade mission this week to Mexico has renewed talk about a potential run. \u201cHe has a record [of governing] and can raise lots of money,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut he\u2019ll also have to run past being too tied to Clinton Inc.\u201d", "time": "2017-05-02T14:47:00.000-04:00"}
