The $1.5 million ad buy, featuring a TV ad and a series of targeted digital ads, comes as the Trump administration seeks to counter criticism that the president's first days in office have not been as productive or as successful as had been hoped. \u201cAmerica has rarely seen such success,\u201d a voiceover says, but later adds, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know it from watching the news.\u201d The ad highlights the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, greater energy independence, de-regulation and Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes as examples of Trump\u2019s 100 day success. \u201cAmerica is winning again and President Trump is making America great again,\u201d the narrator says.", "time": "2017-05-01T08:47:00.000-04:00"}
