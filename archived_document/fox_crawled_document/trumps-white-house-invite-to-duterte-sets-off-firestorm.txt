Not only were U.S. lawmakers left scratching their heads at the Duterte invite, but The New York Times reported that officials at the State Department and the National Security Council were caught off guard and that it\u2019s likely to spur internal objections. Duterte\u2019s leadership in the Philippines and his controversial war on drugs has led to a sharp spike in extrajudicial killings. He\u2019s been accused of masterminding mass killings and is facing a complaint for alleged mass murder before the International Criminal Court. He\u2019s also threatened to kill Filipino journalists, bragged about personally executing people and has spoken about his willingness to commit rape. He\u2019s also compared himself to Adolf Hitler. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Monday the president is \u201cfully briefed on leaders\u201d and that when Trump speaks with leaders \u201che gets briefed on what they\u2019re doing, done.\u201d Democratic lawmakers quickly slammed Trump for first praising and then inviting Duterte to the White House. \u201cPresident Trump weakens American values when he fails to stand up for human rights,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said in a written statement Monday. \u201cPresident Duterte has overseen the illegal killing of thousands of his own people in the Philippines. By welcoming Duterte to meet with him in the White House, Trump risks giving Duterte\u2019s actions \u2013 and his brutal human rights violations \u2013 an American stamp of approval.\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted, \u201cWe are watching in real time as the American human rights bully pulpit disintegrates into ash.\u201d U.S. and Philippine officials said Trump\u2019s calls and invitations to several Asian allies including Duterte were aimed at discussing the escalating nuclear crisis in North Korea. A White House statement described the Saturday call between Trump and Duterte as \u201cvery friendly\u201d and said the alliance between the two nations is \u201cnow heading in a very positive direction.\u201d Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, defended the call on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday when he said the U.S. needs to deal with Duterte, despite his human rights records, in order to help calm escalating tensions in North Korea. Late Monday afternoon, the State Department said it has discussed Duterte\u2019s policies \u201con multiple occasions with the Philippine government.\u201d \u201cWe have encouraged the Philippines to investigate credible reports of extrajudicial killings and note that authorities have taken some steps in this direction,\u201d the State Department said, adding that a \u201cconstructive relationship with the government of the Philippines is critical to supporting the frank and open communication that characterizes our longtime alliance.\u201d Manila is about 1,800 miles from North Korea and its navy doesn\u2019t have a strong defense force, leaving some to question how it would fit into a regional strategy for the U.S. Pyongyang regularly threatens to aim its weapons at South Korea and Japan but hasn\u2019t gone after the Philippines. Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., in a statement, said Trump's invitation was \"unnecessary\" for addressing the North Korea threat. \u201cPresident Trump's decision to welcome the Philippines\u2019 leader to Washington at a time when thousands of Filipinos are being slaughtered in the streets\u2014at President Duterte\u2019s direction\u2014calls into question long held American policy of promoting human rights and the rule of law,\u201d he said in a statement. John Sifton, the Asia advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, took it a step further and said Trump is \u201cmorally complicit in future killings.\u201d \u201cAlthough the traits of his personality likely make it impossible, Trump should be ashamed of himself,\u201d he added. Duterte once told former President Barack Obama to \u201cgo to hell\u201d for criticizing his bloody policies. During Obama\u2019s last few months in office, the Philippine leader actively built closer economic ties with Russia and China while repeatedly threatening to cut military ties that had been in place for years with the United States. Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens told Fox News the pushback by Democrats seemed a little hypocritical. \u201cWhere was the criticism from all of these Democrats when the Obama administration sent John Kerry to the Philippines to meet with Duterte nine months ago?\u201d he asked. But foreign policy experts warn that having a working relationship with a country like the Philippines is far different than showering praise on it and could have serious repercussions down the line. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had relationships with governments that are problematic, but we hold them accountable on it and we don\u2019t lavish them with praise this way,\u201d said Ilan Goldenberg, a former State Department official under John Kerry, told Politico. Despite the invite uproar, Duterte reportedly could not commit to any meeting. \u201cI cannot make any definite promise. I am supposed to go to Russia; I am supposed to go to Israel,\u201d he said, according to\u00a0Yahoo News.
