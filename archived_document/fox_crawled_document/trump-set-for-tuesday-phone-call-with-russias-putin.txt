The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the expected topics of the conversation. But the bloody civil war in Syria and Putin\u2019s continued backing of Syrian President Bashar Assad loom large. Trump and Putin have spoken several times since Trump\u2019s election, including last month following an attack in St. Petersburg, which Trump condemned. Trump said last month that U.S.-Russian relations \u201cmay be at an all-time low.\u201d It was a reversal from the rhetoric during his campaign, when Trump said he hoped he and Putin could work together in the fight against terrorism. FBI and congressional investigations continue into the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia and Russia\u2019s meddling in the election.\u00a0Former Trump adviser Carter Page told Fox News Monday that he is cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s probe into the Trump campaign and contacts with Russia.", "time": "2017-05-02T00:15:00.000-04:00"}
