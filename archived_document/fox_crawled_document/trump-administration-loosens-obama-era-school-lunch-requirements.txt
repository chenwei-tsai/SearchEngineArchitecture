Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said schools will no longer have to try so hard to cut the salt in students\u2019 meals or work in whole grains and non-fat milk. \u201cIf kids aren\u2019t eating the food, and it\u2019s ending up in the trash, they aren\u2019t getting any nutrition \u2014 thus undermining the intent of the program,\u201d Perdue said while visiting a school in Leesburg, Virginia. DOCTOR'S BOTCHED DELIVERY COSTS TAXPAYERS $33M The announcement is the first major move from Perdue, and complies with pleas from school nutrition directors who decried many of the standards under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act signed into law by President Obama in 2010. In particular, they argued for changes to the act\u2019s whole grain and sodium requirements, saying it was hard to find foods that kids would eat under those standards. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing from a lot of parents, students and food service professionals about how we can do better in this role,\u201d said Perdue, according to U.S. News & World Report.\u00a0 \u201cThese changes are not undertaken lightly.\u201d The act, which was part of the former first lady\u2019s broader Let\u2019s Move Campaign, targeted federally subsidized school meals, and had increased requirements for serving sizes and nutrition standards. Schools were required to offer only fat-free or low-fat milk, limit calories based on students\u2019 ages, and cut down on saturated fat, trans fats and sodium among other things. A 'TONGUE PATCH' HELPED ONE WOMAN LOSE 50 POUNDS The Trump administration had signaled that changes were coming in January, when a document released by the office of Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., called for repealing aspects of the act. The details were part of a broader plan released by Meadows tilted, \u201cFirst 100 Days: Rules, Regulations, and Executive Orders to Examine, Revoke and Issue,\u201d which called for the administration to reverse nearly 200 rules and regulations. \u201cThe regulations have proven to be burdensome and unworkable for schools to implement,\u201d a related report from the House Freedom Caucus read. \u201cSchools are throwing food away that students are not eating.\u201d Not all were opposed to Obama\u2019s initiative, as a Christian Science Monitor report published in January 2017 in JAMA Pediatrics found an increase in six nutrients among students who had been served the federally regulated lunches. \u201cIt\u2019s discouraging that just days into his tenure, one of the first things that Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue will do is to roll back progress on the quality of the meals served to America\u2019s children,\u201d Margo Woota, of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said in a statement, according to U.S. News & World Report. FASTING DIET FOR WEIGHT LOSS ISN'T ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE \u201cNinety percent of American kids eat too much sodium every day,\u201d Woota said. \u201cSchools have been moving in the right direction, so it makes no sense to freeze that progress in its tracks \u2014 and allow dangerous high levels of salt in school lunch.\u201d However, a report published in August 2015 by researchers at the University of Vermont found that even though students added more fruits and vegetables to their plates, \u201cchildren consumed fewer [fruits and vegetables], and wasted more during the school year immediately following implementation of the USDA rule.\u201d The report noted that average waste increased from a quarter cup to more than one-third of a cup per tray. In addition to Perdue\u2019s announcement, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it would postpone its rule for calorie labels on restaurant menus and grocery store displays that were set to go into effect this week. The law was part of the 2010 health care overhaul, and required restaurants and other establishments that sell prepared foods and have 20 or more locations to post the calorie content of food. Supermarkets and other businesses opposed to the rules said they are burdensome. The FDA said the delay will allow for \u201cfurther consideration\u201d of ways to reduce costs or make the rules more flexible.
