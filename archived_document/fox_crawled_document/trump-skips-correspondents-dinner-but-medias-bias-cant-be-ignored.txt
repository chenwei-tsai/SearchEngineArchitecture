The moment of journalism\u2019s greatest embarrassment kept its standing as a night the media love, but the nation finds creepy. This year, it needed help from foul-mouthed anti-Trumper Samantha Bee and the press itself to do it. Journalists who campaigned against President Trump both before and after the election questioned the need for the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner this year. Trump helped burn the script by refusing to attend and TBS\u2019 theoretical comedian held a counter event the elite flocked to. NBC said Bee\u2019s \u201cNot The White House Correspondents Dinner\u201d \u201cupstaged\u201d the traditional event. That was easy. \u201cNerd prom,\u201d as it is called inside the Beltway, became a minor event on its own night. It headlined two ancient news icons who helped take down a president more than 40 years ago. The comic host devoted most of his stand-up to attacking the president, who was elsewhere and making a series of Nazi, Holocaust and N-word jokes that were more hate than humor. Journalists and Hollywood listened to the buzz and chose to see Bee\u2019s harder-edged attack on the president and his supporters. Guardian columnist Lucia Graves\u200f correctly characterized the Samantha Bee event as \u201ca fancy protest, but it's still very much a protest.\u201d Trump took a different tactic, holding a campaign-style event in Pennsylvania that let the media have it with both barrels. The president\u2019s special assistant Cliff Sims\u200f emphasized the contrast. \u201cWhile the DC elite don their black ties and ballgowns, @POTUS will be with the People in Penn.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence started it off to a roaring crowd telling them, \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d Trump slapped the media hard, as always: \u201cA large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation\u2019s capital right now,\u201d said Trump, with huge crowd support. He noted that the D.C. event was \u201cwithout the president\u201d to large cheers. When he mentioned the media covering his rally, the crowd booed them. Trump continued to slam the media. \u201cMedia outlets like MSNBC and CNN are fake news.\u201d He gave journalists a harsh assessment. \u201cLet\u2019s rate the media\u2019s 100 days because, as you know, they are in disgrace.\u201d He added, \u201cThe media deserves a very big, fat failing grade.\u201d The Correspondents\u2019 Dinner had become an embarrassment -- an event the media obsessed about. Top journalists rubbed elbows with actors and actresses, major donors and prominent politicians -- the very people they are supposed to report on the rest of the year. ABC News said it was, \u201ctypically one of Washington\u2019s hottest events,\u201d like that\u2019s a good thing. It even involved a red carpet photo spot just like Hollywood award shows. This year, CBS\u2019 \u201cresident cartoonist\u201d Liza Donnelly\u200f was \u201clive-drawing\u201d the event and Politico ran a \u201cWhite House Correspondents Dinner party guide.\u201d The Hill cautioned about the 2017 dinner and its \u201cweirdness\u201d factor. Where was that comment every other year? The war between the press and Trump meant several press figures wanted to either skip the dinner or cancel it entirely. Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan was one who wanted it over, saying it was time to \u201cstick a silver-plated fork in it.\u201d Bear in mind, Trump had even been booed by the press at the event way back in 2011. Now that he won, it was time to cancel the event in the eyes of the \u201cneutral\u201d press. Trump\u2019s absence took the air out of the annual event that had always included jokes at both the presidents\u2019 and media\u2019s expense. Bee seized on it to hold a publicly anti-Trump event that was, allegedly, pro-free press -- \u201cdirty words and all.\u201d It drew a star-studded crowd, including \u201cAlysia Reiner of \u2018Orange Is the New Black,\u2019 Retta of \u2018Parks and Recreation\u2019 and Matt Walsh of \u2018Veep\u2019\u201d according to NBC. They were joined by numerous CNN staffers such as Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, \u201cDana Bash, Jim Acosta and Brianna Keilar.\u201d Add to it, political types like Valerie Jarrett, and Black Lives Matter spokesman Deray McKesson. The after party featured Elvis Costello. It was exactly the kind of event ordinary Americans despise. Bee\u2019s \u201cparty for the press\u201d featured comedian Will Ferrell, who appeared as George W. Bush, mocking Trump, of course. \u201cFor the longest time I was considered the worst president of all time \u2014 that has changed,\u201d Ferrell told an applauding audience, according to Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI needed eight years, a catastrophic flood, a war built on a lie and an economic disaster. The new guy only needed a hundred days.\u201d Bee showed how Democrats and journalists (occasionally those aren\u2019t the same) can\u2019t get over Hillary Clinton losing. Vulture.com wrote up her concluding segment: \u201cSamantha Bee closed out her \u201cNot the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\u201d with a bang at the DAR Constitution Hall on Saturday. Taking a page out of \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u2019s\u201d playbook, Bee ended her special by imagining a world where Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, was elected president of the United States.\u201d As part of tying the left and the press closer, the event\u2019s swag bag included \u201cfree press\u201d T-shirts. All this came at a very bad time for journalists -- after years of layoffs and declining status. Now, journalism is unpopular as a profession and with the public. \u201cBroadcaster is the second worst job of the year, and newspaper reporter takes the top spot,\u201d according to Career Cast. A recent poll doesn\u2019t make it look any brighter in the eyes of the audience. \u201cIn the new poll, roughly half (51 percent) of Americans said the national political media \u2018is out of touch with everyday Americans,\u2019 compared with 28 percent who said it \u2018understand the issues everyday Americans are facing,\u2019\u201d according to the Morning Consult. D.C.\u2019s elite journalists, outfitted in the night\u2019s fancy dresses and black-tie outfits, seemed a throwback to yesteryear when they controlled the levers of American society.  A Dinner Conservatives Had A Hard Time Swallowing Journalists long loved the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. It gave them a chance to celebrate Democratic presidents and openly attack Republican ones. That was before 2017. The Trump-era news media don\u2019t hide their contempt for conservatives. The previous comedy lineup was usually openly hostile to the right -- Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Larry Wilmore, for example. This year was worse. The Hollywood Reporter even had a comedy writer create a phony speech for Trump had he attended the event. Danny Zuker, a writer-producer on ABC's comedy \u201cModern Family,\u201d uncovered \u201cthe remarks that might have been if POTUS hadn't decided to sit this one out.\u201d He joked about \u201cThe failing New York Times,\u201d \u201ca record for attendance,\u201d launching missiles into Iraq or Syria and making fun of Trump\u2019s marriage. \u201cYou're monsters. You're worse than ISIS. Sean Spicer says you're worse than Hitler. Kill yourselves,\u201d he concluded as Trump. This year\u2019s dinner was in the identical vein. It featured the pair of journalists who took down a previous Republican president -- Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein -- an unsubtle statement by the supposedly neutral press. It included a video clip from actor Alec Baldwin impersonating Trump, telling them to \u201cKeep up the good work.\u201d And \u201cThe Daily Show\u2019s\u201d Hasan Minhaj was the comic relief -- yet another wild, left-wing voice. Minhaj opened up joking about the \u201cseries finale of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner.\u201d \u201cWe gotta address the elephant who\u2019s not in this room,\u201d \u201che is in Pennsylvania because he can't take a joke.\u201d He then proceeded to work his way through the administration (House Slytherin) underlining why Republicans should consider whether to ever attend in the future. He went after Trump (Russia jokes, tan jokes, the \u201cOrange Man behind the Muslim ban\u201d), Betsy DeVos (rich joke), Steve Bannon (Nazi joke), Rick Perry (IQ joke), Mike Pence (afraid of women joke), Jeff Sessions (Confederate joke, N-word joke), Sean Spicer (Holocaust joke) and Fox News (Bill O\u2019Reilly jokes that got applause, Jesse Watters jokes, Muslim jokes). He made some other press jokes with USA Today, MSNBC and CNN all targets to more softball mockery. Then he went on a riff comparing journalists to minorities. He was periodically serious, \u201cDo I come up here and try to fit in? Not ruffle any feathers? Or do I say how I really feel?\u201d He did, endlessly bashing the administration while claiming he was asked not to do so. Minhaj made his mark during the Radio Television Correspondents Association Dinner with an incredible comment: \u201cWhat we saw in Orlando was one of the ugliest cocktails of the problems that we still see here in America, a cocktail of homophobia, xenophobia, lack of access to mental health care, and sheer lack of political will....Is this what you [Congress] want your legacy to be?...That you were complicit in the deaths of thousands of Americans?\u201d He followed the equally liberal Larry Wilmore who hosted in 2016. Yet journalists pretended they were surprised Trump didn\u2019t attend. Nevertheless, White House Correspondents\u2019 Association President Jeff Mason shouted into the wilderness at this year\u2019s event: \u201cWe are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.\u201d The 35 percent of Americans who are conservative have their doubts.  An Anti-Trump Event The Media Love Samantha Bee has become one of the popular faces of what liberals call \u201cThe Resistance\u201d to Trump. Her show is a weekly tirade against all things Trump. And that has become the foundation for her celebrity. Hollywood lined up to promote her event or to attend. Fellow TBS comedian Conan O'Brien\u200f pumped it up as a Bee vs. Trump gathering. \u201cTomorrow on TBS, @realDonaldTrump faces his greatest nightmare: a funny female immigrant with a brain.\u201d He oversold Bee a bit. Her \u201chumor\u201d is often filled with jokes about the female anatomy. Bee, whose schtick is a trashy anti-Trumpism, advertised the event with this: \u201cTonight\u2019s episode is a repeat so we can care for our vaginas, but don\u2019t forget to tune in to #NotTheWHCD on Saturday!\u201d Naturally, Hollywood and DC media love her.", "time": "2017-04-30T07:36:00.000-04:00"}
