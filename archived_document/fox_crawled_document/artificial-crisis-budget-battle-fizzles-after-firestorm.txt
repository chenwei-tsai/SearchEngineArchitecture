Tom Cole, R-Okla., pulled no punches when the House Rules Committee met Thursday night to prepare a seven-day spending extension to avoid a government shutdown. \u201cWe did the incoming administration no favors when we did not do this,\u201d protested Cole, a respected, senior member of the Rules and Appropriations committees. \u201cI think we put President Trump in a difficult spot. I\u2019m not sure his team realized how difficult a spot. But frankly, leadership of this body should have known.\u201d What Cole referred to was a failure by the GOP-led Congress to address funding the government weeks or months ago -- rather than just hours before the government was slated to run out of money late Friday night. \u201cThis was an artificial crisis that never should have been created,\u201d pronounced Cole. Back in December, congressional Democrats only wanted to fund the government through March. But Republicans insisted on an April 28 deadline. They argued the House and Senate would spend the first few months of the Trump administration repealing and replacing ObamaCare. Confirming the President\u2019s Cabinet would consume months. Then there would be the confirmation process for Trump\u2019s Supreme Court selection. This would all chew up weeks. So congressional leaders elected to punt on government spending until late April. After all, many of the annual spending bills for fiscal 2017 \u2013 which runs through Sept. 30 \u2013 were close to completion late last year. How hard could it be? Well, it was. Senate Democrats slowed confirmations for many of the president\u2019s cabinet members to a crawl. Democrats dragged out debates and votes in the middle of the night and at the crack of dawn. House Republicans stumbled badly to approve a bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare, exhausting countless cubic centimeters of political oxygen on that process over the past several weeks. So, not a lot of time to work on the spending plan to keep the federal lights on. Or was it just a lack of focus? \u201cYou all set this arbitrary deadline. It's absurd you all need another week,\u201d griped Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., to his GOP colleagues at last week\u2019s Rules Committee session. \u201cIf we keep doing it this way, we probably won\u2019t be doing it much longer,\u201d suggested Cole of House Republicans. \u201cI hope in a week we'll be done,\u201d said Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas. \u201cI promise you, we\u2019ll pass this one-week resolution and we will be back here May 5 or May 4 talking some more,\u201d predicted Hastings. You can appreciate the skepticism of Hastings. The GOP hasn\u2019t accomplished a lot since January. The failure to advance health care still stings. One can place a healthy wager that the White House and House Republican leadership will flail about with another fire drill in a last-ditch effort to salvage the struggling bill. Maybe Republicans finally get it. Perhaps they don\u2019t. But one thing is clear: expending too much effort on the health care bill again this week is dangerous \u2013 while staring at the potential of a government shutdown for the second week in a row Friday night at 11:59:59 pm ET. \u201cThere are a lot of members who will vote for a week-long CR (Continuing Resolution) who won\u2019t vote for a longer CR,\u201d suggested Cole. A CR is the seven-day, interim spending bill the House and Senate approved Friday to avoid disaster last week. By definition, a CR simply renews all old funding at the current level. Congress could do a CR again. But Cole intimates that this time around, the House and Senate need to approve what\u2019s called an omnibus spending bill where they marry all 12 of the appropriations bills together in a giant, catch-all package. The omnibus would fund the government through the end of September. In other words, another stopgap CR won\u2019t fly. On Friday, the House approved the first CR 382-30. 207 Republicans voted yea. That figure is important. With 412 members casting ballots, the GOP scored precisely the number of votes they needed to score to advance the CR on their own. But Cole\u2019s point is spot on. Republicans and Democrats are less willing to back another makeshift spending accord. \u201cIt\u2019s our anticipation we won\u2019t need to do another CR,\u201d suggested House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on the floor Friday. On Sunday night, word came that lawmakers forged a pact on the omnibus. The blueprint included specific language barring construction of a wall. But lawmakers agreed to $1.5 billion in other border security provisions. There was no cut in money for Planned Parenthood. Much of the EPA\u2019s budget survived. President Trump scored a $21 billion increase in military spending and the possibility of $2.5 billion for a plan to combat ISIL. It\u2019s doubtful Republicans in both bodies can approve the measure by themselves. Some members will balk at not okaying the individual, 12 appropriations bills by themselves instead of mixing them together. Other Republicans will demand more spending in some areas. Conservatives would prefer less. That\u2019s why Republicans made sure to tuck some major Democratic provisions into the plan. One of the final sticking points was a $296 million rescue plan for Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid program. Democrats pushed hard for those provisions. Democrats contend they bargained away some 160 \u201cpoison pill\u201d riders. Those are special add-ins important to Republicans, but deal-breakers for Democrats. \u201cThis agreement is a good agreement for the American people and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. So getting this plan off the table early in the week is important for Republicans. That could enhance the likelihood for Republicans to take another crack at repealing and replacing ObamaCare this week. The chances of that? \u201cWe\u2019ve made great progress,\u201d said Kevin McCarthy on the floor Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything scheduled for next week.\u201d Capitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.
