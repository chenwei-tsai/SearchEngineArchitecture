The people working on the series agree.\u00a0 Samira Wiley, one of the leads, says that since the election \u201csuddenly [the show] was dangerously close to the climate that we were starting to live in.\u201d Actually, this \u201crelevance\u201d business is old news. \u00a0No matter who\u2019s in office, there\u2019s always some right-wing monster to be beat back using Margaret Atwood as a battering ram Indeed, when she published the book in 1985, it was based on what was going at the time.\u00a0 Atwood, a Canadian, apparently felt Americans weren\u2019t fully aware of the potential religious fanaticism roiling under their country\u2019s surface. Not that those on the left didn\u2019t already agree with her.\u00a0 Many back then were explicitly alarmed by the rise of Ronald Reagan and the religious right, believing our country was fast becoming a totalitarian state. And certainly reviewers of the day saw the connection between Atwood\u2019s fiction and reality. The Dallas Morning News: \u201cThe brilliance of Atwood\u2019s novel [...] rests in her creation of a future that is a too logical extension of many dimensions of the present.\u201d The Seattle Times: \u201c[Atwood] has written a portentous, satirical but ultimately depressing book about what life might be like under a president from the Religious Ultra-Right.\u201d Los Angeles Times: \u201cAtwood has created [...] an array of active and passive supporting characters, each of whom represents a type familiar in America today. [....T]he power of the book comes not from Atwood\u2019s inspired flights of fancy [...] but from her deliberate subjugation of imagination to demonstrable fact.\u00a0 Only the form of \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 is fiction, as the form of \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019 was autobiography.\u201d So here it is, 30 years later.\u00a0 The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is a perennial bestseller, and, due to its continued \u201crelevance,\u201d has been adapted into a movie, an opera, a ballet, a play, a radio show and now a TV mini-series. Of course, the usual claim is it\u2019s become more relevant.\u00a0 For instance, in a 2015 Cincinnati Enquirer review of the theatrical version, we get \u201cas the world has unfolded since Atwood\u2019s novel was published in 1985, it is not completely far-fetched.\u201d And that was when Barack Obama was President.\u00a0 With Trump now in office, it\u2019s that much easier for The Nation (among other periodicals) to state Atwood\u2019s \u201cdystopian novel is seeming more prescient by the year.\u201d Just one question, then. This dystopia has been rounding the corner in America for over thirty years.\u00a0 When is it finally going to arrive? After all, since Reagan we\u2019ve had a number of Republican Presidents, and Republican Congresses.\u00a0 And all during that time a Supreme Court with a majority chosen by Republicans. Yet, with an issue such as, say, abortion, where is the debate at?\u00a0 Whether or not taxpayers should be forced to subsidize the procedure. (Right now, the answer is yes.) Or look at gay rights.\u00a0 In The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, homosexuals are severely punished for being \u201cgender traitors,\u201d while in America, \u00a0same-sex marriage--so controversial eight year ago that President Obama opposed it\u2014is now a right. This is prescience? Yes, it\u2019s true, there are totalitarian theocratic societies out there. Just not America\u2014now or any time soon. The people who see America in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale are lacking a sense of proportion.\u00a0 So they don\u2019t win every debate in this country, or every election, but no one does\u2014it\u2019s not a harbinger of tyranny. In fact, it\u2019s a hallmark of democracy.", "time": "2017-05-02T12:30:00.000-04:00"}
