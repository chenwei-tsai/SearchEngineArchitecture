Andrew M. Cuomo. For a combative but contained 17 minutes, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday offered terse answers to an abundance of questions from reporters, mostly dealing with the fallout from overlapping federal and state investigations into his administration, in a performance that in recent weeks has become a kind of house style for his embattled mayoralty. Seated at a blue table, the mayor restated the mantra that his administration would eventually be found to have done everything appropriately. He laid out dots but no names \u2014 referring to \u201ca particular reporter\u201d at one point, a state official with \u201ca particular employment history\u201d at another \u2014 and asked reporters to connect them, arguing by insinuation that they would lead back to Mr. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat. \u201cA lot of good questions to follow up on there,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, suggesting as he has for weeks that an investigatory report from the State Board of Elections highly critical of his fund-raising on behalf of Democrats in the State Senate had been leaked by those close to the governor to damage him. The back and forth, at the tail end of an hourlong news conference on crime statistics at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan, came on the second day of an increasingly open war of words between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, whose deepening feud has shown little sign of being repaired. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo told reporters that \u201cthe mayor was wrong\u201d about the origin of the leak, which the state inspector general found to have come from a Republican spokesman for the bipartisan election board. (The governor had previously said the leak might have come from Republicans on the board.) \u201cHe, in my opinion, falsely and recklessly accused public servants who are just doing their job of being unprofessional,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cI think he should apologize.\u201d So, the mayor was asked the next day, would he apologize? \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, shaking his head. Later, he reiterated, \u201cNot going to happen.\u201d Mr. de Blasio instead appeared to stick with the story of a state investigatory apparatus aimed unfairly at him, complaining of a \u201cdouble standard\u201d as he had in previous news conferences, and observing that party affiliation may not preclude the hand of the governor in the leak. \u201cThe lines between Democrats and Republicans often blur in Albany,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. Over the past two days, both men also took their swipes when asked about supporting the other for re-election. \u201cI\u2019m not a city resident,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m focused on 2016,\u201d Mr. de Blasio replied on Thursday when asked about endorsing the governor. Flanked by top police officials, Mr. de Blasio spoke as much through facial expressions that, at times, revealed his frustration: a pinched smile, a smirk, the movement of his eyes upward to the ceiling as he batted back questions. As Mr. de Blasio spoke, two top aides to the governor posted their own thoughts on Twitter, seemingly emboldened by the inspector general\u2019s report and Mr. Cuomo\u2019s words a day before to attack the mayor more directly. \u201cI\u2019m sure saying \u2018I was wrong\u2019 is one of the hardest things to do in politics, but continuing this charade at this point is just silly,\u201d wrote Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor. \u201cDeflect is a lesser known river in Egypt as well,\u201d he said in another post. Melissa DeRosa, the governor\u2019s chief of staff, mocked \u201cwhatever planet that presser was held on\u201d and observed that \u201cthe last time Mayor demand facts be brought to light, they were, he was wrong, and his lawyer went so far as to threaten a personal lawsuit.\u201d But for all the political tumult, Mr. de Blasio appeared more at ease on Thursday than in recent news conferences, emphasizing at several points how he and his team were \u201cvery comfortable\u201d that the inquiries would reveal no wrongdoing. \u201cThe truth is a very comforting thing,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re comfortable with the truth.\u201d As if to underscore that point, Mr. de Blasio remained seated at the blue tables \u2014 with paper nameplates in front of each official \u2014 that in recent weeks have become a hallmark of his news conferences. The blue tables have appeared at police events and at those related to housing; uptown in Washington Heights and downtown at City Hall. \u201cThese are long, long proceedings,\u201d he said when asked about the tables. \u201cIt just makes more sense to sit down.\u201d Another New York politician also, at times, favors the sit-behind-a-table approach: Mr. Cuomo.", "item_type": "Article"}
