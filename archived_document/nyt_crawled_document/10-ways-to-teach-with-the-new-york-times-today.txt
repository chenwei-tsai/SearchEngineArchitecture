{"text": "On April 26 we hosted our first Learning Network webinar, and even if you didn\u2019t join us live, you can still watch it here. Inspired by the many schools who have just received subscriptions to NYTimes.com through our new Sponsorship program, we decided to showcase 10 ways most teachers can weave any day\u2019s paper into their curriculum without a lot of advance planning. Below, we reproduce as faithful a version of what we said live as we could capture in a single post. If you have any questions, though, please feel free to ask them in the comments and we\u2019ll answer you there. And please join us for our next webinar, on May 10, about encouraging summer and independent reading with The Times. Or, let us know what webinar topics you\u2019d like us to offer next school year. Thank you for teaching and learning with The Times! _________ Maybe you\u2019ve just gotten a class subscription to NYTimes.com, or maybe, at a time when everyone\u2019s talking about \u201cfake news,\u201d you would like your students to understand what makes a trusted, 165-year-old news source different from invented information created by jobless young people in need of cash. We have a quick game that can help \u2014 a scavenger hunt that should take just one class period for most students. The 26 questions are designed to get students clicking around NYTimes.com, learning how to navigate the site, locating news that\u2019s important to them \u2014 from the local weather to sports scores \u2014 and understanding things like how to use Times search, what a byline is, and how the Opinion section is different from the news section. It also invites them to think about the role of a newspaper in a democracy, by posing one simple challenge: For instance, try that with the headlines from the April 1, 2017, front page: The hunt ends by asking them to choose one article that especially interested them and read it closely \u2014 something we consider perhaps the most important first step you can take in getting your students to build a news-reading habit. Allowing students free choice and letting them \u201cwander\u201d through the paper shows them how much there is beyond big front-page headline news \u2014 and, with almost 20 years of hearing from students on this site, we promise you that you\u2019ll be surprised by the interesting breadth of choices they make. You can take the learning even further with this related lesson plan. (And if you\u2019re using the paper in print, we have a couple of games for that too \u2014 both a separate scavenger hunt and Front Page Bingo.) _________ One of the top reasons teachers and students visit The Learning Network is to use our daily writing prompts. Like all our student features, they and the Times articles they link to are completely free. Every school day since 2009 we have asked a Student Opinion question. That\u2019s more than a thousand questions so far. To find them, use the writing prompt icon on the Learning Network home page. There you will see we offer two types of daily prompts. Our Student Opinion questions include an excerpt from a Times article, as well as sub-questions to promote deeper thinking. Our Picture Prompts include just a few lines of text and invite student writing inspired by an image \u2014 although they, too, link to a related Times article. Teachers tell us Picture Prompts work particularly well for E.L.L. students and middle school students, though, of course, they can be used with many kinds of learners. Over the years we\u2019ve collected our most popular Student Opinion questions into two different lists: one that features  401 argumentative writing prompts and another that contains 650 narrative and personal writing prompts. Both of these lists are organized by categories, such as \u201csocial media\u201d or \u201cvideo games,\u201d and all of the questions link back to the original post. In addition to our prompts, we also offer rich lesson plans on many writing topics like these two illustrated here, using New York Times features like \u201cModern Love\u201d and \u201cLives\u201d to teach personal writing and how to teach more effective counterarguments. _________ We know how important it is to give students an authentic audience beyond the classroom for their writing and opinions. One feature of The Learning Network we\u2019re very proud of is the way it allows students from around the world a public voice. All our writing prompts are open to student comment, and tens of thousands of teenagers have posted their thoughts over the years. Students can also read what others have to say and reply to them. And, unlike most other online public forums, our comments are all human-moderated. While we\u2019re quite forgiving of spelling, grammar or vocabulary errors \u2014 after all, for many in our audience, English is not a first language \u2014 we do not approve rude or disrespectful remarks. Our goal is to promote civil dialogue, no matter what the issue. In addition to our daily writing prompts, we also offer student contests throughout the entire year. This school year\u2019s contests include our editorial cartoon contest, our Year in Rap contest, our 15-second vocabulary video contest and more. We\u2019ll announce our 2017-18 contest calendar at the end of the summer. Each student entry is read or judged by an editor of the Learning Network, a New York Times staff member, a teacher-partner of ours, or an expert in the field. We publish the winning submissions of each contest on The New York Times Learning Network, and we also celebrate the work of runners-up and honorable mentions too. Until May 9 we\u2019re running our Annual Found Poem Contest, which challenges students to use language from The Times to make poetry. On April 27 we announced our Eighth Annual Summer Reading Contest, which will run from June 16-Aug. 25. Our second live webinar, on May 10, will focus on this contest and what you can do with it in the classroom. _________ Our site helps you do this every day, and many teachers know that if important breaking news happens, we\u2019ll always create a student writing prompt, lesson plan or other feature to give you a quick way to weave it into your curriculum. But if you want some quick suggestions that can work with any day\u2019s paper, here is our 50 Ways to Teach With Current Events that contains both our own ideas and ideas from teachers all over. The Times itself has also made keeping abreast of the news easier than ever: \u2022 Every weekday morning and evening, and once each weekend, you can find a \u201cbriefing\u201d on the home page that summarizes the top stories in just a couple of sentences. You and your students can also get that briefing by email if you like. \u2022 The Times is now on Snapchat Discover, with new visual narratives every 24 hours. \u2022 You can also listen to a new 15-minute daily podcast that explores the top news and puts it into context. For our part, once a week on The Learning Network we write a 10-question news quiz just for students. Each question provides a bit of context and links to the original story, as well as scores how many got each question right. We always save our 10th question for news literacy: Students have to choose which of four articles is not from The Times, but, instead, from the satirical site The Onion: We also choose an Article of the Day every weekday, on important stories students need to understand \u2014 and on topics we think will interest them. For each, we pose comprehension questions to help them read the article, as well as a Warm-Up and Going Further that they can do on their own, or that teachers can turn into a lesson plan. A typical week might look like the one in early April in which we chose stories on Syria, the Supreme Court, Space X, video gaming and an arts program in a U.S. prison. _________ Back in 2011, professors at James Madison University were so inspired by a Times series on DNA that they made it the required reading for the incoming freshman class \u2014 then got those students to create the dance you see above, a \u201cphysical representation\u201d of what they learned. One of those professors wrote it up for us. We love to hear about how people are teaching and learning with The Times. Our Reader Ideas column features scores of ideas, sent in by teachers, librarians, coaches, parents and peer-educating teenagers, all showing you how easy it can be to connect what you\u2019re already teaching to current events or other Times features. Whether you have a relatively simple idea like using restaurant reviews with E.L.L. students or an elaborate project done by the entire incoming class at your university, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Here\u2019s how Joni-Jean Crivello, a middle school social studies teacher in New Jersey, uses the paper: If you teach with The Times, just tell us about it here. _________ How is the history or literature you\u2019re teaching still relevant today? What recent research reporting in the Science Times might update your biology textbook? How are questions you pose in your civics class playing out on the front page? Via The Times, your students can see the concepts, questions and theories they wrestle with in class in action in the \u201creal world.\u201d We offer weekly lesson plans that attempt to simplify things for you by collecting articles, essays, videos, photographs and infographics on often-taught subjects. English teachers: We have a big, and growing collection that matches literature to the nonfiction found in The Times. In some of these lesson plans, we choose just one piece that works well, as in this \u201ctext to text\u201d lesson plan that pairs an article about delayed adulthood with \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye.\u201d Other lesson plans provide several ideas for teaching an author or work, each with many links to Times features that can help, as in Seven Ways to Teach Shakespeare, which includes everything from videos from the Theater section to an article about a Baghdad production of \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d featuring Shiites and Sunnis. Here is our complete collection as of now, but it\u2019s always growing: Maya Angelou, \u201cThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,\u201d \u201cAntigone,\u201d \u201cThe Book Thief,\u201d \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye,\u201d \u201cThe Crucible,\u201d \u201cDeath of a Salesman,\u201d Roald Dahl, Charles Dickens, \u201cEnrique\u2019s Journey,\u201d \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d \u201cThe Giver,\u201d \u201cThe Glass Castle,\u201d \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u201d \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d \u201cThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,\u201d \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d \u201cThe Kite Runner,\u201d \u201cLord of the Flies,\u201d \u201cOf Mice and Men,\u201d John Milton, \u201cThe Necklace,\u201d \u201dOrwell and \u201c1984\u201d, \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d \u201cA Raisin in the Sun,\u201d Shakespeare, Mark Twain and \u201cHuckleberry Finn,\u201d \u201cThe Scarlet Letter,\u201d \u201cSpeak,\u201d and \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d Social studies teachers: When there\u2019s important news we know teachers want to bring it into the classroom right away \u2014 such as the president\u2019s immigration ban or the rising concern over fake news \u2014 we publish a lesson plan to help you. But we\u2019re also mindful of topics that we know are already embedded in your curriculum, and we want to help you connect those to current events easily. For instance, in one lesson this year we paired Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest with a speech by Frederick Douglass. In another, we tied the Syrian refugee crisis with Jewish refugees in the 1930s. STEM teachers: Our STEM lessons take the latest research that appears in the Science Times, such as genetically engineered organisms and Crispr technology, or statistics and the Electoral College, and provide ways to help students go deeper and make connections. We also have a whole column of STEM-focused Articles of the Day. But if you\u2019re just looking for inspiration, the Science section front is the place to start. For instance, if you don\u2019t know about the very short (one to three minute) \u201cScience Take\u201d videos, we hope you\u2019ll find them uniquely easy to weave in. And if you\u2019re looking for a lesson plan or teaching resource on any topic \u2014 whether climate change, infectious diseases, or checks and balances in government \u2014 just scroll down on the Learning Network home page or our Lesson Plan page to find our search bar. Type in what you\u2019re looking for, and see what comes up. You can also do a search from the NYTimes.com home page for anything you\u2019re teaching, which will surface articles with those keywords published in The New York Times since 1851. Sometimes, as in the cases of topics like the Civil War or the theory of evolution, the topic is so big and so much has been written about it that there will be a whole Times Topics page that collects all the most relevant Times articles published on the subject. _________ If you picked up a copy of an 1851 New-York Daily Times, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find any visual images, but that\u2019s not at all true today. NYTimes.com is full of photographs, videos, illustrations, charts, graphs, infographics and maps that present an opportunity for students to look closely, practice their visual thinking and analysis skills, and engage with the news and the world. One way to find intriguing Times images and videos is by clicking on our Multimedia icon. There you\u2019ll find perhaps our most popular weekly feature, What\u2019s Going On in This Picture? Every Monday we ask students to look closely at an image stripped of its caption and closely observe what they see. Typically we have several hundred students participating in a live-moderated discussion each week. We hear from English teachers, E.L.L. teachers, elementary school teachers and even science teachers about how much they love this feature \u2014 and how easily it can be used to encourage students to support claims with evidence. We also have a Friday Film Club, where we feature a short Times film, usually under 10 minutes long, on a range of interesting subjects, such as low-rider fans and their tricked-out cars in Odessa, Texas. In addition, we offer a bank of lesson plans and teaching resources on how to use Times visuals, such as our collection of 25 mini-films on race, bias and identity; and our lesson plan on teaching with ScienceTake videos; our lesson plan \u201cBaseball, Happiness and Immigration,\u201d which highlights various U.S. maps such as the \u201cMap of Baseball Nation\u201d; and our math lesson on using infographics, including a graph illustrating from where N.B.A. players are most likely to hit their shots. And if you\u2019re not familiar with The Upshot, check it out \u2014 it\u2019s a Times section dedicated to telling important stories with analysis and graphics. _________ Newspapers like the Times have been called the \u201crough draft of history,\u201d and if you flip through the tool we call TimesMachine, you can see why. TimesMachine allows you to page through every single edition of The New York Times from 1851-2002, exactly as it was originally published. So you can see how \u201cMen Walk on Moon\u201d was originally reported, but you can also see the moon-themed advertisements that accompanied the reporting that day, as well as what was happening back on earth, from the movies that were playing to what the fashions looked like to who was winning in baseball. We also have many lesson plans and collections that link to archival reporting we\u2019ve found for you, such as our recent Vietnam War lesson, or these about the transcontinental railroad, Black history, World War I, the civil rights movement and many more. In most of these collections, we link not only to archival articles, but also to collections of photographs, relevant videos, essays, first-person accounts, infographics and more. But keep in mind that The Times now and The Times then is not only front-page news about wars and disasters. You can also find cats mailing themselves to Santa and the history of the prom and the first mention of pizza. We hope both you and your students will have fun looking around. _________ The photo above is a screenshot of the home page one day this month, and, as you can see, at least nine of what we used to call \u201cSAT words\u201d are waiting there for your students. But we guarantee that if you go to the home page at any time, including right now, there will be at least that many, if not more \u2014 all offering a way to understand words in context. On our site, we have a couple of features that can help deepen vocabulary-learning. Our Word of the Day feature tells you how often a word was in the Times in the last year, includes an interesting paragraph for context, and ends with a little quiz that tests student understanding. We also have an annual contest that invites students to make 15-second videos to show their understanding of the word of their choice ... like this recent winner who defined \u201cnocturnal.\u201d You can find many more ideas in our 12 Ways to Learn Vocabulary With The New York Times. And we have heard from both teachers and parents that the Daily Mini crossword \u2014 which can take just seconds or minutes to complete depending on the day \u2014 is very popular with teenagers, and a fun way to learn vocabulary. We also have lesson plans on a number of other literacy skills that you can use across the curriculum, and we reinforce those skills regularly in all of our features. Here are just a few: Making inferences Close-reading Summarizing Annotating Determining the reliability of sources Sorting fact from opinion Listening and note-taking Revising writing _________ The best way to get teenagers to start reading The Times or any other newspaper regularly? Just give them time to browse the articles, features, photos, videos, podcasts, games and graphics and find what they like. We know from nearly 20 years of hearing from students on this site that you\u2019ll be surprised and delighted by the range of stories they choose \u2014 and what they say about why they chose them. This home-schooled girl wrote to our Reader Ideas column last year and explained how she \u201cwanders\u201d through The Times daily, and finds everything from recipes she wants to make to physics articles from the Science Times to talk about with her brother. Since 2010, our Summer Reading Contest has tried to encourage this \u201cwandering\u201d by posing two simple questions each Friday: \u201cWhat interested you most in The Times this week? Why?\u201d This year the contest runs from June 16-Aug. 25, and we\u2019d love to have your students join us. Everything you need to know to participate is here, but we\u2019ll also have a webinar that goes beyond the contest to talk about making The Times an integral part of an independent-reading program in your classroom. _________ Finally, if you watched our webinar, you know we had help from the Times political and investigative reporter Nicholas Confessore. He spoke about how a Times story is reported, written, fact-checked and published, and he focused that explanation on this Feb. 18, 2017, article, \u201cTrump\u2019s \u2018Winter White House\u2019: A Peek at the Exclusive Members\u2019 List at Mar-a-Lago.\u201d You might ask your students to read the piece carefully and think about what a journalist might need to do to obtain and verify information like The Times reported \u2014 then invite them to watch the last part of the webinar (beginning at 39:11) to hear about how he and the rest of his team did it. You might also like to ask them to respond to the question a webinar participant asked (beginning at 53:40), \u201cWhat do you see as the biggest problem for a new generation of citizens, our students, now that there is less clarity between real and fake news?\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/learning/lesson-plans/10-ways-to-teach-with-the-new-york-times-today.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "The Learning Network", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T11:34:04-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T11:34:04-04:00", "abstract": "Ideas for weaving any day\u2019s Times into classes across the curriculum without a lot of advance planning.", "title": "10 Ways to Teach With The New York Times Today"}
