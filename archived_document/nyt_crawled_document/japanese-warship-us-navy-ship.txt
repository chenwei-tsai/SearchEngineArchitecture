{"text": "TOKYO \u2014 A Japanese warship accompanied a United States Navy supply ship on Monday on its way to join an American aircraft carrier and three other warships in a strike force that entered the Sea of Japan over the weekend. The group is meant to send a powerful deterrent signal to North Korea at a time of mounting tensions on the Korean Peninsula over the North\u2019s advancing nuclear program. Japan\u2019s action is a sign of its expanding military presence in the region. It is particularly significant because it represents the first time a warship is being used to aid an allied force since the country\u2019s Parliament passed legislation authorizing overseas combat missions. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe fought a hard political battle to push through those security laws two years ago, and they remain contentious in a country that has considered its postwar pacifism a deeply embedded part of its identity. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force dispatched the Izumo, a helicopter carrier, on Monday morning from Yokosuka base, southwest of Tokyo. The base is also home to the American aircraft carrier Reagan. \u201cIt is extremely significant to show that the deterrent force and readiness of the Japan-U.S. security alliance are powerful,\u201d said Fumio Kishida, Japan\u2019s foreign minister, in remarks to reporters in Turkmenistan, where he was attending talks with his counterparts from several Central Asian countries. Under Japan\u2019s new security laws, Japan may engage in \u201ccollective self-defense,\u201d meaning its military forces may guard the ships or weapons of United States forces when Americans are involved in the defense of Japan. The laws were largely seen as a first step by Mr. Abe to expand the country\u2019s military power and, eventually, overturn the clause in the country\u2019s postwar Constitution that calls for the complete renunciation of war. The Japanese public is deeply divided over whether to modernize its Constitution to allow for more military activity. A poll published on Monday by Kyodo News showed that respondents were nearly equally split on the question of whether that pacifist clause should be revised.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/world/asia/japanese-warship-us-navy-ship.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T09:53:48-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T09:53:48-04:00", "abstract": "Japan\u2019s action is the first time a warship is being used to aid an allied force since Parliament passed legislation authorizing overseas combat missions.", "title": "Japanese Warship Escorts U.S. Supply Ship on Its Way to Join Strike Force"}
