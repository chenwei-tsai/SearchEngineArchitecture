The set-up-heavy season three premiere was an exception, as episodes toward the beginnings and ends of seasons tend to be. But this week\u2019s episode, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Ridiculous,\u201d is classic \u201cLeftovers,\u201d focusing almost entirely on Nora Durst as she gets an unexpected phone call that for a few days turns her life upside-down. I say \u201calmost entirely\u201d because the hour ends with an epilogue so bizarre and confounding that it\u2019s tempting to focus only on what it might mean. As with the brief glimpse last week of an Australian woman named Sarah \u2014 who looks like an older version of Nora \u2014 this week brings a grizzled Aussie sheriff named Kevin, who aside from his uniform looks nothing like Kevin Garvey (although that doesn\u2019t stop some local women from kidnapping and drowning him, presumably to see if he\u2019ll resurrect). There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, from the possible symbolism of this new Kevin\u2019s running over a kangaroo in his police cruiser, to the last-second appearance of Garvey senior, who unlike his \u201cson\u201d doesn\u2019t look appreciably older. For now, though, it\u2019s best to wait for more information \u2014 which is apparently coming soon, since Nora\u2019s about to take a trip Down Under with her boyfriend. Until then, why dwell on the last few minutes when the first few are so sublime? \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d rarely gets as much credit it deserves for being funny, but that may change after the whammy of this episode\u2019s opening credits: Remaining are the haunting images from last season\u2019s opener, but Iris DeMent\u2019s plaintive \u201cLet the Mystery Be\u201d has been replaced with the theme song to the \u201980s sitcom \u201cPerfect Strangers.\u201d Weirdly, the swap works, because the lyrics are fully \u201cLeftovers\u201d-appropriate: The juxtaposition of jaunty music with pictures illustrating the Sudden Departure is hilariously jarring; but it also forces viewers to see the credits in a whole new way. Without DeMent\u2019s song, something is \u2026 well, missing. The new theme song serves as foreshadowing, because a surprisingly large chunk of this episode is about the actual sitcom \u201cPerfect Strangers.\u201d Fans of \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d will recall the running gag through the first two seasons \u2014 mostly seen on TV news reports in the background \u2014 about three of the sitcom\u2019s stars \u201cdeparting,\u201d while the fourth, Mark Linn-Baker (who played Cousin Larry), faked his own disappearance. Since then, Mark\u2019s been working with a company studying the Low-Amplitude Denzinger Radiation found at the sites of departures. They claim to have figured out a way to blast people with enough waves of radioactivity to send them to wherever their lost loved ones have gone. \u201cSwedish physicists have confirmed it,\u201d the actor insists. It\u2019s Mark who changes Nora\u2019s plans in an instant when he calls her from a luxury hotel in St. Louis, promising he can help her see her children again. She arrives in Missouri a skeptic, and seems to leave the same, calmly telling her host that she thinks he\u2019s suicidal, and that this L.A.D.R. device is just an incinerator. But his earnestness clearly gets into her head. The long scene between them is a beautiful piece of acting from Carrie Coon and Linn-Baker, and well directed by Keith Gordon (a former actor). There\u2019s something at once amusingly pathetic and heartbreakingly human in the way Mark points to his two Yale degrees as proof he\u2019s not a sucker, but then gripes: \u201cFour series regulars. Three go, I stay. What are the odds?\u201d Before the phone rings, Nora is busy with the case of \u201cthe Pillar Man,\u201d that shaggy prophet of downtown Jarden, Tex., who has a heart attack and falls off his perch, then seems to disappear \u2014 allowing his wife, Sandy (played by Brett Butler), to claim that she saw him just \u201cdim out\u201d and then depart. Nora quickly ascertains that her brother Matt conspired with Sandy to bury the man, and she files a report with her bosses setting the record straight. After hashing it out, however, she and Kevin agree to let the disciples in the square keep believing that something supernatural happened, to maintain the peace until the Oct. 14 anniversary passes. But then unusual things begin to happen, some of which can be chalked up to run-of-the-mill human impulse, and some of which are harder to explain. For one thing, Nora is suddenly having a hard time getting technology to recognize her. Touch screens go dead. GPS devices won\u2019t let her select her preferred destination. Parking kiosks won\u2019t accept her prepaid ticket. It\u2019s as if she no longer exists \u2014 or as if the universe is subtly guiding her to take a little detour after her trip to St. Louis. For \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d faithful who may have wondered last week what had happened to Nora\u2019s neighbor Erika and to the baby Lily, this latest episode answers both questions. Erika moved away after the Guilty Remnant compound exploded, unable to deal with John\u2019s insistence that Evie might still be alive. As for Lily, her mother came back, claimed legal custody, changed her name and took her away. We learn both of these details because of a side journey by Nora, in which she watches the now-older Lily on a playground (and briefly intervenes on her behalf in a dispute with another kid), and then spends an evening hanging out and commiserating with Erika. That hangout is another well-acted heartbreaker, anchored by a story Nora tells about tattooing her departed family\u2019s name on her arm, then feeling self-conscious about it and tattooing over it with the logo of a rap act she calls \u201cthe Wu Tang Band.\u201d After that, she slammed her arm in a car door so the resulting cast would cover up the second tattoo. The end result of this train of thought is that Nora gets back to Jarden and exposes the Pillar Man\u2019s wife as a fraud \u2014 because the world is weird enough without muddying it up with lies. Sometimes kids vanish because of a possibly divine global event. And sometimes the courts take them away, or the government blows them up with rockets. Nora would prefer not to romanticize any of these outcomes. All she wants is the truth. And nothing\u2019s going to stop her now. (Don\u2019t) Let the Mystery Be: \u2022 Last week established that true believers are pouring into Jarden to get ready for what they\u2019re sure will be a major event on the seventh anniversary of Oct. 14. This week\u2019s episode doesn\u2019t get into the influx of pilgrims much, but it does keep the subplot present in a subtle way by making sure that every scene in town is filled with extras in the background, roaming idly through the streets like tourists at a theme park. \u2022 Another subtle but smart bit of verisimilitude: Down in Australia, they celebrate the anniversary of the Sudden Departure on Oct. 15, because, y\u2019know, time zones. \u2022 After Nora asks to go to St. Louis to investigate the possible \u201ccarrot-stick\u201d fraud that Mark Linn-Baker could be running, her boss, George, hangs up the phone and says to another employee, \u201cShe\u2019s goin\u2019.\u201d The conversation isn\u2019t on speaker phone, so the other man should have no idea what \u201cShe\u2019s goin\u2019\u201d means unless \u201cthe trip to St. Louis was part of some larger, secret scheme. Given the casual way Joel Murray delivers the line, it\u2019s probably just an unfortunate continuity error. But \u2026 what if it\u2019s not? \u2022 When Nora arrives at the St. Louis hotel, Mark immediately tosses her phone in the toilet as a security precaution. \u201cIt\u2019s just hardware,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything that matters is out there in the cloud, right?\u201d Well, that\u2019s this show\u2019s big question, isn\u2019t it?", "abstract": "For all its melancholy, \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d rarely gets enough credit for its humor."}
