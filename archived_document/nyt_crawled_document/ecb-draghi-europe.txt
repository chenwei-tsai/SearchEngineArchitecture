{"text": "FRANKFURT \u2014 With crucial elections in France approaching, analysts do not expect the European Central Bank to upset the eurozone \u2014 the 19 nations using the euro \u2014 by making drastic changes to monetary policy at its meeting on Thursday. But that will not stop analysts and investors from parsing every word spoken by Mario Draghi, president of the bank. They will be listening for any subtle changes in language or tone that would signal a shift in the central bank\u2019s thinking. Here is a guide to some of the important phrases to listen for when Mr. Draghi speaks after the meeting on Thursday afternoon: The European Central Bank has promised to keep buying government and corporate bonds \u2014 a form of economic stimulus \u2014 until the end of the year, \u201cor beyond, if necessary.\u201d Observers of the central bank are obsessing about when in 2018 the bank might begin to wind down, or taper, those bond purchases. Mr. Draghi will probably bend over backward to avoid saying anything on Thursday that would raise expectations that tapering is anywhere on the horizon. After every meeting, the central bank\u2019s governing council issues a statement giving its view on the current state of the economy in the eurozone. The last statement, in March, was slightly more bullish than in previous months: \u201cThe risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become less pronounced,\u201d the statement said, while adding that the risks \u201cremain tilted to the downside.\u201d Any signal that the central bank is becoming more optimistic about growth among countries using the euro would cause analysts to recalibrate their forecasts of when tapering may begin. A rise in the rate of inflation would put pressure on the central bank to ease its stimulus efforts. At its last meeting, the bank dismissed an increase in the official eurozone inflation rate, to 2 percent, as a result of higher oil prices rather than an indicator that the economy was heating up. There are \u201cno signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation,\u201d the bank said in March. If the central bank starts to betray concern about accelerating inflation, that would be another reason to expect tapering to begin sooner rather than later. The bank has been saying for some time that it would not touch official interest rates until after it has stopped buying government and corporate bonds. Still, there has been speculation it could raise the so-called deposit rate \u2014 the interest that banks receive on money they keep at the bank \u2014 sooner. Since June 2014, the rate has been negative, meaning banks have had to pay the central bank to keep their euros safe. Any hint that the bank has been contemplating an increase in the deposit rate would be big news. Without fail, the central bank\u2019s monthly statements beseech leaders in the eurozone to take politically unpopular steps to overhaul their economies by reducing red tape and making it easier for companies to dismiss unwanted workers. Just as reliably, politicians in the eurozone pay no attention whatsoever. But the emergence of Emmanuel Macron as the front-runner to become president of France means that a reformer could soon take charge of the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany. Mr. Draghi will probably resist the temptation to endorse Mr. Macron, but it is a safe bet that he is pleased.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/business/economy/ecb-draghi-europe.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T01:00:25-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T01:00:25-04:00", "abstract": "Analysts and investors will examine every word spoken by the president of the European Central Bank after the bank\u2019s governing council meets on Thursday.", "title": "Words to Watch: How to Detect Shifts by Europe\u2019s Central Bank"}
