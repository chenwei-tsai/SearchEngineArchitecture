Thursday\u2019s 16-inning win in Miami had tired the bullpen, and it showed as the weekend progressed. First, Josh Edgin lost Friday\u2019s game by surrendering a run-scoring double with two outs in the ninth. Then the steady but much-used Fernando Salas blew a two-run lead in the eighth inning of Saturday\u2019s game (although he insisted afterward that he was not tired). And then Addison Reed, arguably the Mets\u2019 best reliever last season, lost Sunday\u2019s game, again with two outs in the ninth. At this point, the bullpen could use a boost, and one is coming: Jeurys Familia, the team\u2019s closer, is eligible to return on Thursday from a 15-game suspension in connection with his domestic-violence case. To stay in pitching shape, Familia spent part of the first week of the regular season throwing at the Mets\u2019 academy in the Dominican Republic. He then threw eight pitches in a spotless inning for the Mets\u2019 Class A affiliate, the St. Lucie Mets, on Saturday. Familia continued his tuneup with Class AA Binghamton on Monday, throwing nine pitches with one strikeout in one hitless inning. By the end of the week, he could be back on the mound at Citi Field, where the Mets will meet the Washington Nationals, their division rivals, for the first time this season in a series that starts Friday night. It was not until Saturday\u2019s loss that Mets Manager Terry Collins conceded that \u201cmaybe\u201d Familia\u2019s absence was beginning to be felt. \u201cYou go with who you\u2019ve got,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played very well, and we\u2019ve gotten the job done with the guys we have down there.\u201d To this point, the workload for the Mets\u2019 pitching staff has been significant, with 125 \u2153 innings pitched \u2014 the most in baseball \u2014 going into Monday\u2019s games. Part of that is because the Mets have already played two long extra-inning games, the 16-inning one and one that lasted 12 innings. In addition, the Mets had played 13 games; more than half the other clubs had played either 12 or 11. The Mets\u2019 rotation, which includes three pitchers returning from injuries and two from operations, has averaged 5.8 innings per start, which was tied for the fifth-highest mark in baseball going into Monday\u2019s games. The bullpen was third in baseball with 49 \u2154 innings. And the Mets had three of baseball\u2019s five most frequently used relievers: Hansel Robles, Jerry Blevins and Salas, all with eight outings, although Blevins had pitched fewer innings because he is used for spot matchups against left-handed hitters. So Familia\u2019s return should help. During Familia\u2019s suspension, Reed and Salas slid up to the closer and setup man roles. Now they can move back. It was Salas who entered Saturday\u2019s game in the eighth inning, after Collins had pulled Jacob deGrom, who pitched seven sterling innings and had 13 strikeouts. At that point, deGrom had thrown 97 pitches, and Collins said it was too early in the season to push him further, particularly because deGrom had had elbow surgery in September. \u201cWe could\u2019ve ran Jake back out there, but if something happens during the summertime and he runs out of gas or something, we can\u2019t look back on a game on April 15 when he threw 115 pitches,\u201d Collins said later. So Collins called on Salas, who had not been scored on all season but was making his eighth appearance in the Mets\u2019 12th game. He surrendered a game-tying, two-run homer with two outs and then a go-ahead home run to the next batter, saying later that it was not fatigue but his command that failed him. After Sunday\u2019s loss, Reed also maintained that he was not tired when he let the game get away. \u201cThroughout the year, you\u2019re going to get overworked,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us can\u2019t handle it.\u201d Perhaps if the starters pitch deeper into games as the season progresses, that will lessen the bullpen\u2019s load. And then there is the return of Familia, giving Collins another reliable option. \u201cThis is a good baseball team,\u201d Collins said after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cWe have issues like everybody else, but we\u2019re trying to mesh a pitching staff that we\u2019ve got to be careful of and a bullpen that we\u2019ve got to be careful of. We\u2019re going to be O.K.\u201d", "abstract": "After three losses to the Marlins in which Mets relievers collapsed in the late innings, there was some good news: Jeurys Familia was set to return after serving a suspension.", "section": "Sports", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/sports/baseball/mets-bullpen-problems-jeurys-familia.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Mets\u2019 Bullpen Has Floundered, but Help Is on the Way", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T20:04:30-04:00"}
