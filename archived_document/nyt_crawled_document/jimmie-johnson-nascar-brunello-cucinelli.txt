{"text": "Although the career of Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time Monster Energy Nascar Cup Series champion, is based on speed, he is not one for fast fashion. Rather, the El Cajon, Calif., native has gravitated to the old basics, he said, calling from Aspen, Colo., where he has a home. (He also has places in New York City and Charlotte, N.C.) As racing season heats up, Mr. Johnson, 41, is looking to stay cool, yet polished, with the help of a few trusty pieces. Suit My preferred suit is actually fire-retardant. But that\u2019s a jumpsuit. Otherwise, Zegna suits are a great starting point. I seem to have a great collection, from tuxedos to casual. I found out they fit great right off the rack; it was just through trial and error. Jeans Especially on the track, I\u2019m in jeans all the time. I\u2019ve worn other brands, but I\u2019ve always gone back to Levi\u2019s. I found a cut that fits me well: the Matchstick slim straight. It\u2019s on the skinnier side, but, at the same time, it\u2019s comfortable. During the hot summer months on the racetracks, finding the right-fitting jean that\u2019s not ultra-baggy is important. Shirt I have a solid lineup of oxfords by Dries Van Noten. My wife is definitely in the know. I think many men are like me, in that we have very little patience for shopping. She\u2019s been very strategic in curating my closet without me putting in a ton of work. Gitman Brothers is another brand that makes great button-downs. They kind of go with anything. For me, solids are safe; stripes are safe. I stick in that realm. And I generally wear black, blue, white, and I mix in some spring colors when appropriate. Jacket I always have these with me: nonwrinkle sport coats by Brunello Cucinelli. They\u2019re in a summer weight, which is key. Racing in the South, it\u2019s humid. There are definitely certain fabrics that show sweat and perspiration immediately. It\u2019s about finding the right breathable materials. These sport coats also truly don\u2019t wrinkle, and they go with everything. I have them in blue, navy and a gray. Shoes I grew up in Southern California, so it\u2019s tough to keep me out of sneakers. Vans are what I wear most often, and I\u2019m in them right now. I\u2019m also a fan of Common Projects. They have a nice clean line, and they even go with a blazer. They have great range.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/fashion/mens-style/jimmie-johnson-nascar-brunello-cucinelli.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T14:43:00-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T14:43:00-04:00", "abstract": "He also likes Common Projects, Levi\u2019s and Dries Van Noten when he\u2019s not on the track.", "title": "Jimmie Johnson, of Nascar Fame, Wears Brunello Cucinelli"}
