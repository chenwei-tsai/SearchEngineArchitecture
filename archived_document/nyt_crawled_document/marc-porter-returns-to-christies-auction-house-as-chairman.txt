{"updated_date": "2017-04-19T11:36:59-04:00", "text": "There\u2019s no place like home. Just three months after Marc Porter started at Sotheby\u2019s, having moved there from Christie\u2019s, he is returning as Chairman of Christie\u2019s Americas, the auction house announced Wednesday. Though Mr. Porter will have the same title he held previously, the role has been expanded to include membership on the executive committee, direct responsibility for special projects and a direct line of reporting to the chief executive, Guillaume Cerutti, who in January replaced Patricia Barbizet. Mr. Porter only recently completed a noncompete year before starting at Sotheby\u2019s as chairman of the Fine Art Division, in January. He has no noncompete arrangement with Sotheby\u2019s and plans to start at Christie\u2019s shortly. \u201cIn my new job, I can mentor all of these people that I want to mentor, I can stay close to the art which I\u2019ve really cared about, I can be involved with the private sale program and I\u2019m on the executive committee,\u201d Mr. Porter said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just right for me.\u201d It was considered a major coup when Sotheby\u2019s won Mr. Porter away from Christie\u2019s in December 2015. But during his yearlong wait to start, the auction landscape has changed considerably, and the air grew thinner at the top of Sotheby\u2019s masthead. Sotheby\u2019s acquired Art Agency, Partners \u2014 bringing an advisory business into its core operations at a cost of up to $85 million \u2014 and made it clear that Mr. Porter was now going to share chairman status with Amy Cappellazzo and Allan Schwartzman. Sotheby\u2019s also hired Christy MacLear, the chief executive of the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, to expand its advisory services for living artists and for artists\u2019 estates and foundations. (Other top stars of the auction world played musical chairs, as well. At Christie\u2019s, Brett Gorvy, the longtime chairman and international head of postwar and contemporary art, left to become a dealer. And Alex Rotter, Sotheby\u2019s former co-chairman of contemporary art, joined Christie\u2019s as chairman of postwar and contemporary art at Christie\u2019s Americas.) Private sales continue to be a growing segment of the auction business, in part because the inventory of top consignments has diminished. This is an area Mr. Porter championed at Christie\u2019s and his new role there will include a focus on private sales, the auction house said. At Christie\u2019s, Mr. Porter will lead the region\u2019s growing client and business development activities and serve as a member of the company\u2019s executive management group, which guides the firm\u2019s global strategy, with the board. The appointment \u201cmarks a further step in the refinement of our structure as we plan for growth opportunities ahead,\u201d Mr. Cerutti said in a statement. During a career that stretched 25 years at Christie\u2019s, Mr. Porter served as chairman and president of the Americas; international head of private sales; and president of Christie\u2019s, Japan, among other positions. He also oversaw many of Christie\u2019s most successful and high-profile collection sales, including those of Elizabeth Taylor and Mrs. Sidney F.
