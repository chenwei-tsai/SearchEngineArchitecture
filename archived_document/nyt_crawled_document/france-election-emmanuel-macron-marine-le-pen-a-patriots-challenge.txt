The centrist, pro-European Union political upstart, Emmanuel Macron, who founded his En Marche! party just last year, looks set to face off against the far-right populist National Front candidate, Marine Le Pen, in the final vote for the French presidency on May 7. Polls have predicted that Mr. Macron will beat Ms. Le Pen handily, though, with its traditional parties left in shambles by this election, France remains deeply divided and its politics unsteady. Certainly, if Mr. Macron prevails on May 7, that will be good news for Europe: The embattled European Union would most likely not survive if France left the bloc. But the strong showing by Ms. Le Pen \u2014 who promises a referendum on France remaining in the union \u2014 is a further warning of the rising danger posed by populist right-wing leaders, in Europe and around the world. Her anti-immigrant National Front party will surely remain strong as long as French unemployment lingers in the double digits, and the many French who believe they have been abandoned by global elites see no better hope elsewhere. Ms. Le Pen called her performance in the polls on Sunday \u201can act of French pride.\u201d Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen\u2019s strong showings have upended French politics, as voters spurned the mainstream center-left Socialist Party and center-right Les R\u00e9publicains party that have dominated the landscape for decades. The Socialist Party of the deeply unpopular president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, lies shattered, with its candidate, Beno\u00eet Hamon, trailing in a distant fifth place. Mr. Hamon conceded defeat on Sunday, throwing his support behind Mr. Macron. A fourth candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon of Les R\u00e9publicains, also failed to win enough votes to put him on the May 7 ballot after being dogged by charges that he used public funds to pay his wife and children for work they may not have done. Mr. Fillon also conceded on Sunday night and said he would vote for Mr. Macron on May 7. He warned of Ms. Le Pen that \u201cextremism can only bring about the misfortune and division of France.\u201d A far-left candidate, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who reaped a late surge of support, was trailing Mr. Fillon, but said he would wait until the final, official count was announced before conceding. France may be entering a new, fractured political era, but on Sunday its voters showed that they remained receptive to Mr. Macron\u2019s hopeful message, including his openness to immigrants and diversity, despite a recent spate of terrorist attacks and Ms. Le Pen\u2019s dark campaign. Mr. Macron said on Sunday that he wanted to be the \u201cpresident of patriots, to face the threat of nationalists,\u201d holding himself out as France\u2019s true agent of change after decades of government failure. France will now face a stark choice on May 7, and hopes for Europe will ride not just on a win by Mr. Macron, but on his subsequent success in delivering on his commitment.", "abstract": "A centrist novice is likely to defeat the right-wing candidate. Yet France will remain divided."}
