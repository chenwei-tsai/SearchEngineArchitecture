{"text": "The opinion columns of The New York Times are supposed to be a place for lively debate. Sometimes, the liveliest debate is over the columns. Especially when the opinions are conservative. There has been an uproar over the hiring of Bret Stephens as an Opinion columnist, as there was an uproar over the hiring in 2008 of William Kristol. \u201cOf the nearly 700 messages I have received since Kristol\u2019s selection was announced \u2014 more than half of them before he ever wrote a word for The Times \u2014 exactly one praised the choice,\u201d wrote Clark Hoyt, who was then The Times\u2019s public editor. But today\u2019s reaction looks muted compared with the hornet\u2019s nest that was stirred in 1973 when the publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, brought William Safire aboard \u2014 directly from the Nixon White House \u2014 without even first informing his cousin, John B. Oakes, the truly liberal editor of the editorial page. Mr. Safire, a speechwriter and special assistant to President Richard M. Nixon, did not disappoint those waiting to pounce. On April 17, 1973, Mr. Nixon declared that \u201creal progress\u201d was being made in getting to the bottom of the Watergate scandal. \u201cI condemn any attempt to cover up in this case, no matter who is involved,\u201d said Mr. Nixon, who was very much involved, as it would later turn out. As far as Mr. Safire could see, the president had triumphed. And on that note, he began writing his \u201cEssay\u201d column on the Op-Ed page: \u201cFor Richard Nixon, this is comeback time \u2014 and when it comes to comebacks, the world\u2019s leading expert has just made his appearance on the right side of the Watergate investigation.\u201d David Halberstam, a highly respected journalist and former Times correspondent, told the publisher \u2014 known as Punch \u2014 that he had made a mistake hiring Mr. Safire. \u201cHe is a paid manipulator,\u201d Mr. Halberstam said, just warming up. \u201cA few years ago when you had just taken over the paper you were handed a tough decision on the West Coast edition,\u201d Mr. Halberstam told Mr. Sulzberger. \u201cYou said \u2014 \u2018It\u2019s a lousy paper. Close it.\u2019 So Punch, this time the play is to you. It\u2019s a lousy column and it\u2019s a dishonest one. So close it. Or you end up just as shabby as Safire.\u201d Mr. Sulzberger demurred. \u201cI appreciate that you feel I am prepared to make a \u2018tough decision,\u2019\u201d the publisher responded, \u201cbut right now, as far as I\u2019m concerned, one is not necessary in this case. While I have not always agreed with Bill, I think he is developing a style of his own and that he is reflecting a philosophy. I remain confident that over the years he will be an important contributor.\u201d But there was no inconspicuous retreat from the initial stumble. \u201cThat is what is called \u2018being really wrong,\u2019\u201d Mr. Safire wrote eight months later. \u201cNot mistaken, not slightly off base, not relatively inaccurate \u2014 but grandly, gloriously, egregiously wrong.\u201d It was hardly the end of the line. Mr. Safire was to win a Pulitzer Prize in 1978 for his columns about Bert Lance, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s budget director, who resigned amid charges that he had personally traded on his ties with the president. The \u201cEssay\u201d column ran until 2005. Mr. Safire\u2019s other column, \u201cOn Language,\u201d ran until 2009. And something besides his briefly-lived contrition explained why a few hearts softened in the Washington bureau, where Mr. Safire worked. On the Fourth of July 1974, members of the bureau and their families gathered at the home of the editor Doug Robinson in Maryland. Bill Kovach was among them. \u201cSafire was the only one who saw Jim Naughton\u2019s young son fall into the pool and thrash around,\u201d Mr. Kovach recalled. \u201cHe swept past me and others and leaped fully clothed into the pool and pulled the boy out.\u201d In the book \u201cSafire\u2019s Washington,\u201d the columnist admitted that his wife, Helene, had pushed him in to save the boy. But the result was the same. \u201cIt was hard to hate me after that,\u201d he wrote.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/insider/william-safire-opinion.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Times Insider", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T21:10:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T21:10:24-04:00", "abstract": "The uproar over the hiring of Bret Stephens as a Times columnist recalls the furor that greeted William Safire\u2019s arrival from the Nixon White House.", "title": "\u2018Paid Manipulator\u2019 in 1973, Pulitzer Prize Winner in 1978"}
