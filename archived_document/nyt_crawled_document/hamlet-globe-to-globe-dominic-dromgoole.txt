It began, we are told, as a whim lubricated by strong drink. In 2012 the management of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe \u2014 the splendid replica of the Elizabethan open-air playhouse, built on the bankside of the Thames in London \u2014 was considering possible eye-catching new initiatives. In the midst of the merry collective buzz, the theater\u2019s artistic director, Dominic Dromgoole, impulsively said, \u201cLet\u2019s take \u2018Hamlet\u2019 to every country in the world.\u201d No doubt even crazier cultural ideas have been proposed, but this one is crazy enough to rank near the top of anyone\u2019s list. Yet it came to pass. An intrepid company of 12 actors and four stage managers, backed up by a London-based staff that undertook the formidable task of organizing the venues, obtaining the visas and booking the frenetic travel, set out in April 2014, the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s birth. They did not quite succeed in bringing the tragedy to every country \u2014 North Korea, Syria and a small handful of others eluded them \u2014 but they came pretty close. One hundred ninety countries and a series of refugee camps later, the tour reached its end in April 2016, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death. While helping to run the busy theater in London, Dromgoole managed to venture off and see for himself some 20 iterations of the production he had co-directed and launched. \u201cHamlet Globe to Globe\u201d is a compulsively readable, intensely personal chronicle of performances in places as various as Djibouti and Gdansk, Taipei and Bogot\u00e1. The book is in large part a tribute to the perils and pleasures of touring. The Globe troupe had to possess incredible stamina. Keeping up an exhausting pace for months on end \u2014 Lesotho on the 1st of April, Swaziland on the 3rd, Mozambique on the 5th, Malawi on the 8th, Zimbabwe on the 10th, Zambia on the 12th, and on and on \u2014 they would fly in, hastily assemble their set, unpack their props and costumes, shake hands with officials, give interviews to the local press, and mount the stage for two and a half hours of ghostly haunting, brooding soliloquies, madcap humor, impulsive stabbing, feigned and real madness, graveside grappling, swordplay and the final orgy of murder. Then after a quick job of disassembling and packing, they were off to the next country. When one or two of the company became ill, as occasionally happened, the group had rapidly to reassign the roles; when almost all of them succumbed at the same moment, as befell them after an imprudent dinner in Mexico City, they had to make do with improvised narration and zanily curtailed scenes. Dromgoole explains that he set the troupe up in the full expectation that not everyone would last the full two years. Hence his insistence that all the actors learn multiple parts so that they could switch around at a moment\u2019s notice. As it happened, the same 16 people miraculously made it through the whole tour. Perhaps changing roles from time to time helped them build the collective sense of trust that sustained them. Perhaps too, as Dromgoole suggests, they drew upon \u201cthe gentle support of each line of verse,\u201d so that even in the most trying of circumstances Shakespeare\u2019s iambic pentameters \u201ckept them upright and somehow kept them moving forward, into the story and towards the audience.\u201d Touring is particularly resonant for \u201cHamlet,\u201d since Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy features a traveling company of players who arrive in Elsinore and are greeted warmly by the prince. Hamlet makes clear that he has a lively interest in the theater, but that interest is not purely aesthetic. He asks the players to stage a court performance of an old play, \u201cThe Murder of Gonzago,\u201d to which he says he has added a few lines. His secret intention is to see if the play triggers in his uncle an involuntary display of guilt, thereby confirming the charge of murder made by his father\u2019s ghost. In the event, the uncle does arise in a rage and brings the performance to a halt, but like almost everything else in the tragedy, the signs are ambiguous. The poor players, in any case, could have no way to grasp why their show provoked such a response. A wonderful production I saw years ago showed them hastily packing up their bags in fear and rushing away. The Globe company, of course, was always packing up and rushing away to the next venue. They did not deliberately set out to provoke moral crises and confessions of murder, even in the most benighted of the countries they visited, but they certainly hoped that the tragedy\u2019s celebrated interrogation of social and psychological ills \u2014 \u201cTh\u2019oppressor\u2019s wrong, the proud man\u2019s contumely, / The pangs of despised love, the law\u2019s delay, / The insolence of office\u201d \u2014 would have some beneficial influence. Tragedy, Shakespeare\u2019s contemporary Sir Philip Sidney wrote, \u201copeneth the greatest wounds, and showeth forth the ulcers that are covered with tissue\u201d; it \u201cmaketh kings fear to be tyrants.\u201d \u201cHamlet\u201d seems particularly suited to this task because of what Dromgoole calls its \u201cprotean nature.\u201d It seems to work equally effectively in the urban heart of the most advanced industrial country and on the shores of the remotest Pacific island. Dromgoole heightened this adaptability by refusing to give the production any strong interpretive twist. \u201cThe best way to avoid a misconception,\u201d he observes, \u201cis to have no conception at all.\u201d As a reviewer in S\u00e3o Paulo wrote admiringly, \u201cThe text was acted in plain mode \u2014 no verbal excesses or unnecessary shouting, just a harmonious recitation of words combined with essential corporal movement.\u201d If there was a special emphasis at all, it was on the prince\u2019s lightness and wit. Hamlet was less the melancholy Dane than the jester in a corrupt world bent on outlawing laughter. \u201cOur show didn\u2019t dazzle or explode,\u201d Dromgoole concedes, \u201cbut it worked.\u201d Looking back on the initial motivations for his wildly ambitious project, Dromgoole ruefully notes two delusions: first, that \u201cHamlet\u201d charted a journey toward peace, leading the troubled prince to a serene recognition that \u201creadiness is all\u201d; second, that it would have a comparably beneficial effect upon its audiences, leading them in some small way toward a resolution of their social and political problems. In reality, over the course of the two years, global problems only seemed to get worse, and the story of the prince, as the company performed it, seemed to tell not of spiritual enlightenment but rather of a bright young light that flamed for a moment only to fade and die. Never mind. The surprise is not that Hamlet failed to heal the world\u2019s woes but rather that he belonged everywhere: \u201cHamlet the icon of restlessness for a world that never seems able to settle. Hamlet who is restless for truth, unable to bear the lie his present moment is built on; who is restless for civility, trying to forge a new care in human engagement; who is restless for honesty and integrity and cannot bear people faking or borrowing their feelings; who is restless for calm when the moment seems a little too noisy, and restless for noise when it seems too calm.\u201d A young person who refuses to make his peace with the sly criminal who has \u201cpopped in between the election and my hopes.\u201d What better hero for our times?", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T08:00:27-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/hamlet-globe-to-globe-dominic-dromgoole.html", "item_type": "Article"}
