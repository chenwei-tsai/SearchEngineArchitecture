{"text": "Credited with directing three d\u00e9class\u00e9 horror movies, dead from an overdose of barbiturates at 25, the British filmmaker Michael Reeves (1943-1969) is a quintessential cult figure. Reeves, like Steven Spielberg and the avant-gardist brothers George and Mike Kuchar, made eight-millimeter films in his movie-obsessed youth and, on a trip to America, paid an unannounced visit to his Hollywood idol, the genre director Don Siegel \u2014 an act of chutzpah that actually resulted in a job. After working in commercials and as an assistant director, Reeves made and even partly financed his first feature, \u201cRevenge of the Blood Beast\u201d (1966), newly out on Blu-ray from Raro Video. Also known as \u201cThe She Beast,\u201d this low-budget Italian production, set in contemporary Transylvania, gave top billing to Barbara Steele, beloved by buffs for her roles in Mario Bava\u2019s \u201cBlack Sunday\u201d (1960) and Roger Corman\u2019s \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum\u201d (1961). That Ms. Steele was only available to shoot for a few days demanded pragmatism from Reeves. She appears as a haughty British honeymooner who, once possessed by the malignant spirit of a medieval witch, mutates into a hideous, murderous crone played, under thick, pustulant makeup, by a male actor. This amalgam of the awful and the audacious is a demented gross-out comedy that often evokes the early work of John Waters. It clearly amused Reeves to depict modern Transylvania as a shabby police state ruled by inept policemen. Much of the action takes place in the run-down Hotel Moskva; one gruesome attack winks at Communist iconography when the weapon \u2014 a sickle \u2014 is tossed away to land neatly on a hammer. There is also some effective filmmaking. A flashback in which an accused witch is put to death by hysterical townspeople previews similar lynch-mob sequences in Reeves\u2019s last and strongest film, \u201cWitchfinder General\u201d (1968). Before \u201cWitchfinder General,\u201d however, Reeves directed, and partly wrote, \u201cThe Sorcerers\u201d (1967), a seedy evocation of swinging London complete with Soho clubs and third-rate beat bands; Boris Karloff stars as the inventor of a device for inducing hypnotic trances. Karloff\u2019s gizmo evokes motion-picture technology while the notion of movies as a form of mind control is further elaborated upon when the inventor and his deranged wife (the distinguished actress Catherine Lacey) program a feckless young mod (Ian Ogilvy, Ms. Steele\u2019s husband in \u201cRevenge of the Blood Beast\u201d) to embark on a career of extreme naughtiness. As self-reflexive as it is, \u201cThe Sorcerers\u201d (available on DVD from Warner Archive) has been compared to Michael Powell\u2019s \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d (1960). Better written than directed, \u201cThe Sorcerers\u201d is at once an evocation of psychedelic fascism and a Freudian comedy with a hapless protagonist subject to subliminal prompts from two parental figures. \u201cWitchfinder General,\u201d set in mid-17th-century East Anglia during the English Civil War between the forces of Oliver Cromwell and Charles I, is the movie in which Reeves brought it all together. Reportedly bullied by his young director into a serious performance, Vincent Price is truly frightening as the sanctimonious sadist Matthew Hopkins, a historical figure who used torture and blackmail to \u201cdiscover\u201d Catholic witches among the peasantry. Redolent of social breakdown (and retitled \u201cEdgar Allan Poe\u2019s The Conqueror Worm\u201d), the movie was released in the United States in August 1968, a season of acute political violence. The New York Times reviewer Renata Adler, who saw it at a 42nd Street theater, seemed as interested in the audience as she was in the tumult onscreen: \u201cA man behind me snored and a middle-aged couple next to him quarreled viciously, but people woke up for the action and particularly cheered when Price was hacked to death.\u201d Some years later, the Village Voice critic William Paul caught \u201cWitchfinder General\u201d and \u2014 in a review that established Reeves\u2019s posthumous American reputation \u2014 declared him \u201cthe most audacious visual talent to have come out of England since Hitchcock.\u201d \u201cWitchfinder General\u201d has been released on disc several times, most recently on Blu-ray as one of six films included in Scream\u2019s \u201cVincent Price Collection.\u201d Perhaps some altruistic distributor will thrill cultists with a Reeves collection, even including \u201cCastle of the Living Dead,\u201d a 1964 French-Italian vehicle for Christopher Lee that some fans believe was mainly shot, uncredited, by Reeves, the second-unit director. \u201cWitchfinder General\u201d is a classic example of florid gothic cinema, a British exploitation mode that, along with Italian westerns, graced the grungy movie houses of the 1960s and early 1970s. \u201cThe Lair of the White Worm\u201d (1988), new on Blu-ray from Vestron, might be considered a one-off revival of the mode, directed by Britain\u2019s master of high-minded hysteria, Ken Russell. The suitably outlandish plot, loosely adapted from a novel by Bram Stoker, concerns an outbreak of pagan snake-worship in present-day Derbyshire. The young Hugh Grant is surprisingly intense as a drawling young lord, but the movie is stolen by a neighboring aristocrat, played by Amanda Donohoe (known then mainly as an associate of the New Wave singer Adam Ant). Fabulously chic and seductively sinister, Ms. Donohoe is actually a vampire priestess, prone to coldblooded hissy fits, sprouting fangs at will and spraying a venom that transports victims into a mad delirium of screaming nuns, rampaging serpents and bloody crucifixions. One of Mr. Russell\u2019s most enjoyable films, \u201cWhite Worm\u201d seems a uniquely British amalgam of high camp, lurid psychedelia and rowdy Celtic folk-punk. As regional as \u201cWitchfinder General,\u201d it feasts on the Midlands countryside. Setting the movie in England rather than Transylvania, Mr. Russell told Film Comment magazine, \u201cmade it potentially more alarming \u2014 and, of course, absurdly comical.\u201d NEWLY RELEASED THE BOY FRIEND First released in 1971 and now out on Blu-ray, Ken Russell\u2019s knowingly retro movie version of Sandy Wilson\u2019s already retro stage musical is overdue for re-evaluation, post \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Twiggy stars in the Ruby Keeler role; Glenda Jackson has a memorable, uncredited walk-on as the diva she supplants. (Warner Archive) DEMON SEED Best known for his collaboration with Nicolas Roeg on the Mick Jagger film \u201cPerformance,\u201d as well as an appearance in Kenneth Anger\u2019s occult short \u201cLucifer Rising,\u201d Donald Cammell directed his first solo film in 1977 \u2014 a kinky technophobic thriller, now reissued on Blu-ray, in which Julie Christie is impregnated by a rogue computer. (Warner Archive) THE LOVE WITCH Anna Biller\u2019s sly, stylish and sardonic tale of female fantasy and Wiccan romance run amok is many things, including a homage to the gaudy, sexually charged horror films of the late \u201960s and early \u201970s. \u201cMs. Biller\u2019s movie, like its heroine, presents a fascinating, perfectly composed, brightly colored surface,\u201d A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times in November 2016. On Blu-ray, DVD and Amazon Video. (Oscilloscope) MULTIPLE MANIACS John Waters\u2019s second feature, made in 1970, is in some ways his most transgressive \u2014 a satire of a Manson Family-like cult, starring Divine, designed to appall hippies and, he has said, \u201cshock the world.\u201d In addition to interviews with cast and crew members, extras include audio commentary by Mr. Waters himself. On Blu-ray and DVD. (Criterion) THE VAMPIRE BAT Newly restored by the U.C.L.A. Film & Television Archive and now on Blu-ray, this 1933 \u201cDracula\u201d knockoff was a surprisingly atmospheric film from a small studio, Majestic. Renting stars from the majors, it features Lionel Atwill, Melvyn Douglas and Fay Wray, as well as one strikingly economical use of color.
