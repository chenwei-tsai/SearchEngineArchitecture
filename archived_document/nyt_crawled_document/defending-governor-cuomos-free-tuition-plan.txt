{"abstract": "New York\u2019s budget director, rebutting criticisms in a Times editorial, argues that the plan will encourage students to graduate on time.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "To the Editor: \u201cMr. Cuomo\u2019s Free* College Plan\u201d (editorial, April 15) contains few details on the program\u2019s merits and even fewer on the program\u2019s alleged flaws. The Excelsior Scholarship has set a national standard for college access by providing free tuition at New York\u2019s public colleges for any family making less than $125,000 per year. A central component of the program is to incentivize students to graduate on time, because the longer they remain in school, the more expensive it becomes and the more debt they take on. Like most states, New York must improve its on-time graduation rates of 9 percent at community colleges and 39 percent at four-year institutions. To meet the 30-credit requirement, students will be able to take classes over the course of the calendar year (spring, summer, fall and winter). The reality is, college was never supposed to take seven years. New York State, in connection with the tuition program, will offer robust funding for e-books to lower costs for students, and currently operates the \u201cGet on Your Feet\u201d loan forgiveness program to cover the first two years of loan payments for recent graduates who make $50,000 or less. It\u2019s important to note that the Excelsior program will in no way harm private colleges. New York already spends more taxpayer dollars on private schools than any other state besides Texas \u2014 $2.7 billion since 2011 alone. While innovative ideas can be threatening, knee-jerk opposition is worse.
