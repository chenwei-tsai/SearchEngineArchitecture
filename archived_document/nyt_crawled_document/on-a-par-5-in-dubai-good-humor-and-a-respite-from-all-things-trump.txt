{"text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 President Trump has already played an incredible amount of golf in his first 100 days. He says he needs the break. I sympathize. In fact, I need a break, too \u2014 from him, from writing about his relentless assault on truth and science. It\u2019s toxic. So I break today to write about \u2026 golf \u2014 in Dubai, where I recently participated in an education conference.  Dubai is not a democracy and is fueled by cheap labor. But it\u2019s also not Damascus. With its Ministry of Tolerance, Ministry of Happiness and Ministry of Youth (whose minister is a 23-year-old woman), the U.A.E. has made Dubai into the counter-ISIS, a place where young Arabs can live local and act global. It\u2019s the most interesting crossroad city in the Arab world today. You run into the most unexpected characters here \u2014 especially on the golf course \u2014 which is where our story begins. So a Hindu, a Muslim and a Jew are playing golf together in Dubai \u2026 Sounds like the first line of a joke, right? Actually, it\u2019s the first line of one of those serendipitous stories that often happen when you play golf abroad. In my case, I was invited to play at the Emirates Club with a U.A.E. education expert and the famed Indian mystic, poet and yogi Jaggi Vasudev, who goes by his reverential name, Sadhguru. When I got to the first tee, I realized this was not going to be a normal round. Sadhguru is the founder of Isha, an Indian-based humanitarian and environmental movement with millions of followers (and some critics, too) \u2014 several of whom I could tell were at the course, because caddies and staff members kept coming over for selfies with Sadhguru and offering the traditional Hindu greeting, \u201cI bow to the divine in you.\u201d What made it fun was that Sadhguru was not dressed in his traditional multicolor robes, but a gray Under Armour golf shirt, tight golf slacks and a floppy golf hat. The only giveaways to his day job were an ankle bracelet peeking out above a golf shoe and the longest flowing white beard I\u2019ve ever seen on anyone trying to swing a club. I thought: Was he Bobby Jones in a previous life? Sadhguru got addicted to golf while visiting followers in America. With about a 15 handicap now, he can hit a drive 220 yards. As a yogi, it was not surprising that he had probed the deeper meaning of the game: \u201cThe simplicity of it makes everyone attempt it, but the subtlety of it makes almost everybody get frustrated with it,\u201d he once observed in an interview with Isha\u2019s magazine. Golf was also just like life (and yoga), he added: People mess up at both when their \u201cinterior is not settled.\u201d He was also up on all the jokes about Jesus and Moses playing golf together. So as we waited to tee off on a par 3, I offered him and our Muslim partner my favorite Jewish golf joke: This threesome is at a public course and the starter comes over and says, \u201cDo you mind if this rabbi plays with you?\u201d They say, \u201cNo problem.\u201d The rabbi walks up on the tee with banged-up clubs, a tattered golf bag and a yarmulke instead of a golf hat \u2014 but then proceeds to shoot a 69. At the end of the round one of the other players asks, \u201cRabbi, how did you get so good?\u201d \u201cYou have to convert to Judaism,\u201d he answers. So, a year goes by and the same three guys arrange to play with the rabbi again. He shoots another 69, but they all still shoot in the 90s. At the end of the round, one says: \u201cRabbi, I don\u2019t get it. We all converted like you said, but you still shot 69 and we all still shot in the 90s. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cWhat synagogue did you get converted at?\u201d the rabbi asks earnestly. \u201cTemple Beth Shalom,\u201d they answer in unison. \u201cOh no,\u201d says the rabbi. \u201cTemple Beth Shalom? That\u2019s for tennis!\u201d Sadhguru loved that one, and for the rest of the round when the yogi missed a shot he would look over to me and say, \u201cWrong temple!\u201d We had a match and I gave Sadhguru extra shots to make up for the difference in our handicaps. The 18th hole was a 550-yard par 5 around a lake, and Sadhguru hammered his first two shots and had only 110 yards to the green. As he got an extra shot on this hole, it wasn\u2019t looking good for me. So I tried to get into his head: \u201cAs a holy man,\u201d I whispered to him, \u201cdon\u2019t you feel guilty taking a shot from me on this hole?\u201d \u201cNot at all!\u201d he grinned. But when he chunked his next shot he exclaimed that a higher power had clearly intervened \u2014 and given me my shot back! Two days later I ran into Jeby Cherian, who used to run IBM\u2019s Global Business Services unit in India but quit in 2015 to build Sadhguru\u2019s Leadership Academy. I asked him what the yogi\u2019s message was to young leaders? Sadhguru sees \u201cleadership as serious sacrifice \u2014 not as power to dominate,\u201d Cherian said. The best leaders \u201cfirst work on themselves to achieve the necessary inner capabilities, because their actions impact millions of people. If you are personally transformed then you will conduct yourself in a manner that is inclusive. If you are inclusive, then you will transform the communities you live in and thereby the world.\u201d Hmm, I thought, I know a golfer-leader who should meditate on that message, but, as promised, I\u2019m not writing about Trump today.", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "abstract": "Oh, and there\u2019s this yogi with a flowing white beard and golf clothes.", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T03:21:16-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "title": "On a Par 5 in Dubai, Good Humor and a Respite From All Things Trump", "item_type": "Article", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/opinion/on-a-par-5-in-dubai-good-humor-and-a-respite-from-all-things-trump.html", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-26T03:21:16-04:00"}
