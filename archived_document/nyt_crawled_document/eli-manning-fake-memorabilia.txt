Manning addressed the accusations after a plaintiff in a 2014 lawsuit recently filed a motion to compel testimony that included an email from Manning to a team equipment manager asking for two helmets that could pass as game-used items. Manning refused to discuss the specifics of the civil case, which is scheduled to go to trial in September in state Superior Court in Bergen County, N.J. \u201cI will say I have never done what I have been accused of doing,\u201d Manning said at a news media availability for the Giants. \u201cI have no reason nor have I had any reason to do anything of that nature. I have done nothing wrong and I have nothing to hide, and I know when this is done everyone will see it the same way.\u201d Manning said he could handle people attacking him for his play, but attacking his integrity was something else, and his voice reflected that he was upset. \u201cI think my track record of how I have handled myself since I have been here in New York since 2004 speaks for itself,\u201d Manning said. \u201cI have tried to do everything with class and be a standup citizen. That\u2019s what I have done.\u201d Eric Inselberg, a sports memorabilia collector from Short Hills, N.J., sued Manning, the Giants co-owner John Mara and others in 2014, alleging they engaged in a scam to sell fake \u201cgame-worn\u201d equipment for profit. He also asked that the Giants be held accountable for the lies that led to his indictment on federal charges that ruined his business. Those federal charges against Inselberg were later dropped. His lawsuit against Manning and the Giants returned to the headlines recently when the plaintiff filed a motion to compel testimony. It included the email from Manning to a team equipment manager. Manning insisted that email was taken out of context, adding that some recent court filings will make that clear. \u201cThis was first reported three years ago and I have been dealing with it for a long time,\u201d Manning said, \u201cbut I am just more angry than anything having to deal with it, knowing I have done nothing wrong and still being attacked.\u201d Manning said he has been surprised how people have turned in the wake of the email, which he gave to the plaintiff in discovery. \u201cSomeone starts something up and everybody turns against you very quickly,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d He said the league has not talked to him about the allegations. Manning has a deal with Steiner Sports to provide memorabilia. He said he has never personally sold or made any money off a jersey or helmet sale. Manning, who is scheduled to earn almost $20 million in salary and bonuses this season, was asked why he had a contract with a memorabilia dealer when he made so much money on the field. \u201cWell, it\u2019s just autographs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just a way to sign your name, and I think a lot of people do it. It is just part of the business.\u201d", "abstract": "The Giants quarterback addressed accusations related to a 2014 lawsuit, saying an email to a team equipment manager was taken out of context.", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T22:26:30-04:00", "title": "Eli Manning Denies Claim Regarding Fake Game-Used Memorabilia", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/sports/football/eli-manning-fake-memorabilia.html"}
