{"text": "The young stars of the year\u2019s funniest global home video have been transformed into a cartoon by a Brooklyn couple hoping that the precocious kids will be just as cute in two dimensions. The two children, Marion and James Kelly, who became a brief obsession for the internet-using world when they adorably interrupted their father\u2019s BBC interview in March, are the inspiration for a new cartoon featuring their likenesses, as well as those of their parents, Robert E. Kelly and Kim Jeong-ah. The show, \u201cThe Adventures of Mina & Jack,\u201d consists of only one short episode at the moment, though another is in the works. The characters\u2019 names have been changed, but their images are unmistakable, and the episode features a brief tribute to the viral moment that brought it into being. So far, it can only be seen on YouTube, and no major (or minor) outlet has signed up to distribute it. Marion became a favorite of viewers the world over when she strolled into the room where her father, fated to be known forever after as the \u201cBBC Dad,\u201d was conducting an interview about South Korean politics. She was closely trailed by her infant brother, who was in a walker. Mr. Kelly chose to continue the interview; at the end of the clip, his wife dashes in, sliding across the floor and almost falling in her effort to remove the kids from the room. Lauren Martin, who used to write for Elite Daily and is now a producer who helps create content at Complex, pronounced herself \u201cobsessed\u201d with the clip in an interview on Thursday, saying that she thought she had watched the video \u201clike 100 times.\u201d \u201cI just love Marion,\u201d Ms. Martin, 26, said. \u201cI just love her.\u201d She and her boyfriend, Jarryd Mandy, who live in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, decided that the world needed more of the Kelly kids. Originally they had planned to write a children\u2019s book, but decided the project would be better as a cartoon. The couple contracted a studio, Raxo, to make a pilot episode. Here it is. The Williamsburg couple decided not to seek the family\u2019s blessing before they had a finished product, and sent the first cartoon to Mr. Kelly with bated breath. But he declared himself a fan, even retweeting the video from his Twitter account, amid posts about French politics, the South Korean election and the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. Mr. Kelly and his family are still using Skype, as he was when the original interview mishap took place. They used the platform to talk to the Brooklyn couple on Wednesday night, Ms. Martin said. Mr. Kelly is now officially a consultant for the cartoon, and the family will have some creative control. If the show manages to make money, Ms. Martin said, the Kellys will also receive some of the royalties, though she admitted \u201cwe haven\u2019t really gotten that far.\u201d Mina and Jack, the names for the Marion and James characters in the cartoon, have so far only had one adventure in \u201cNorth Africa,\u201d where they accompanied their father and helped foil a gold thief. Marion is the star of the show; James is her sidekick and her father is portrayed as a clumsy but lovable idiot. The pilot lasts just over three minutes. Ms. Martin said that she and Mr. Martin have spent a significant amount of their savings on the second episode.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/television/bbc-dad-cartoon.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T11:49:40-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T11:49:40-04:00", "abstract": "A video that tickled the globe has inspired a Williamsburg, Brooklyn, couple to pitch an animated series.
