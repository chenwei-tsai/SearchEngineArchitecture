Mr. O\u2019Reilly, on vacation in Italy for the past week, sat in a V.I.P. section and shook  hands with Francis. A photographer for L\u2019Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican newspaper, took a picture of Mr. O\u2019Reilly, in a striped tie, shirt and jacket, shaking hands with Francis. The weekly audience is a large event open to the public, with tens of thousands of the faithful filling the square. But the special section beside the stage holding the papal throne, where Mr. O\u2019Reilly sat, is exclusive and entered only with special tickets distributed by the prefecture of the papal household, according to the Vatican press office. The Vatican said last week that no official audience with Mr. O\u2019Reilly was scheduled or would occur. The current prefect of the papal household is conservative Archbishop Georg G\u00e4nswein, the longtime personal secretary of the pope emeritus, Benedict XVI. The post-audience greetings in the section are something akin to a V.I.P. rope line, and a way for visiting dignitaries to get to meet the pope without a formal audience. Often though, the pope is unaware of the people he is meeting there, and Wednesday\u2019s exchange with Mr. O\u2019Reilly echoed the pope\u2019s 2015 meeting in the United States with Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky who became a conservative hero for defying a court order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. That meeting struck a discordant note with the rest of Francis\u2019 visit to the United States, but many conservative American Catholics, who have criticized the pope\u2019s inclusive agenda, pointed to it as proof that the pope had not departed from the traditional culture war agenda. Mr. O\u2019Reilly falls on the conservative side of the divide and in February 2016 lectured Francis over immigration after the pope stepped into the heated American presidential campaign. In remarks that appeared aimed at Donald J. Trump, who had pledged to build a wall at the border with Mexico, Francis said: \u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.\u201d Days later, on his television show, Mr. O\u2019Reilly, who has been a key booster of Mr. Trump, said: \u201cThe pope. I would very much like to speak with him. And if I can arrange that, I would like to bring the family of Kate Steinle with me,\u201d he said, referring to an American woman killed by a Mexican laborer who had been deported from the United States multiple times, a case often brought up by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. \u201cFinally,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly added, \u201cI would suggest to Pope Francis that millions of Americans have been harmed economically by our immigration system, which desperately needs reform. I think I could persuade the pope that providing protection and enforcing settled law is certainly not un-Christian.\u201d It was unclear if Mr. O\u2019Reilly said as much during his face time on Wednesday with Francis, who has made mercy a cornerstone of his pontificate. A priest translating for the English-speaking visitors and pilgrims summarized Francis\u2019 remarks made to the general audience and then told the ticket-holding attendees the pope would give them his apostolic blessing and bless their religious artifacts. The encounter came as Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s career at Fox News looked increasingly imperiled after dozens of advertisers abandoned his highly-rated program and the Murdoch family that owns Fox News\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, began to show signs of eroding support. The family has supported Mr. O\u2019Reilly in the past, but a New York Times article this month detailing harassment allegations against him seems to have put his standing atop cable television news in jeopardy. On a chilly Wednesday morning at the Vatican, Francis circled the piazza in his popemobile and spoke to the faithful about how happiness and joy can grow where everyone thinks there is only \u201csadness, defeat and shadow.\u201d \u201cGod makes his most beautiful flowers bloom amid the most arid rocks,\u201d Francis said. Then he gave a special greeting to English-speaking pilgrims, including Mr. O\u2019Reilly, saying: \u201cI invoke upon you and your families the loving mercy of God our Father.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/world/europe/bill-oreilly-meets-pope-francis-in-vatican-vip-line.html", "section": "World", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "The embattled Fox News, on vacation in Italy for the past week, sat in a V.I.P. section and shook hands with Francis.", "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly Meets Pope Francis in Vatican V.I.P.
