But in his new Netflix movie, \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday,\u201d he does take things down a notch; he\u2019s less frenetic and more reactive. Perhaps he knows that a lot of people watching this sweet, silly film will be in a mellower place than they were when \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse\u201d was on television more than a quarter-century ago. Those, of course, would be adult viewers. The movie is perfectly appropriate for children, too, but whether the kiddies of 2016 will get Pee-wee, the man-child character played by Paul Reubens, the way an earlier generation did is hard to gauge. A digital-era 6-year-old might well slip off with a more typical 21st-century diversion, while Mom and Dad revel in the kitschy loopiness that they loved as children or younger adults. \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday,\u201d which becomes available on Friday, is a road yarn, as was \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure,\u201d the 1985 film directed by Tim Burton. (John Lee directs here; Judd Apatow produced with Mr. Reubens.) Pee-wee, after a delightful signature opening full of Rube Goldberg-like devices, has his bland but blissful life disrupted when the three other members of his musical group, the Renegades, tell him they\u2019re dismantling the band. Just when he\u2019s at his lowest point, who walks into the diner where he works but the actor Joe Manganiello, playing himself. It\u2019s a fortunate encounter, both for Pee-wee and for viewers: The two pair charmingly. Mr. Manganiello (\u201cTrue Blood\u201d) is a big star, but Pee-wee, whose sheltered existence has been confined almost exclusively to the tiny town of Fairville, doesn\u2019t recognize him, which only endears him to Mr. Manganiello more. \u201cThat\u2019s what I like about you, Pee-wee,\u201d he says, straight-faced. \u201cYou\u2019re normal.\u201d He invites Pee-wee to his birthday party in New York, and that sets Pee-wee off on an eventful cross-country journey. He encounters a farmer with many marriage-age daughters, a dodgy guy who lives in a cave, an Amish community and more. The cast is a mix of recognizable stars and the less well known. Three female bank robbers (Jessica Pohly, Stephanie Beatriz and Alia Shawkat) make the biggest impression. Will they or any of the other obstacles keep Pee-wee from reaching New York? Will friendship prove to be the balm that soothes all disappointments? There\u2019s never much doubt.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T06:00:06-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/arts/television/review-for-pee-wees-big-holiday-walk-gingerly-and-wear-a-red-bow-tie.html", "item_type": "Article"}
