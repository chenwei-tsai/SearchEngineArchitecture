{"text": "A TV network is accused of political bias: Hardly a surprise in 2017. But what if the network is a sports broadcaster? An unusual strain of partisanship \u2014 at least in the sports corner of the media \u2014 emerged last week after ESPN announced it was laying off dozens of employees. The public reaction included jeers at the network for what some viewers perceived as a leftward slant in ESPN\u2019s coverage, a reflection of how the country\u2019s raw political nerves and cultural divisions have spilled over into a world that many value as a pristine redoubt from worldly concerns: sports. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the times,\u201d Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports who is a professor at the Columbia Journalism School, said. \u201cI think people are looking for bias, and opinion, and information that in some way involves some hidden signal or indication that there\u2019s a political bias in one direction or another.\u201d It is not as if American sports and politics have never intersected. From Jackie Robinson\u2019s breaking Major League Baseball\u2019s color barrier to Billie Jean King\u2019s fight for gender equality in tennis to John Carlos and Tommie Smith\u2019s black power salute at the 1968 Olympics, many moments and figures in sports history mark social mileposts. And ESPN has had no shortage of political story lines to explore lately, including: the quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling during the national anthem in protest of what he saw as widespread American racism; the United States women\u2019s soccer team and women\u2019s hockey team\u2019s raising issues of equal pay in labor disputes; and several members of the New England Patriots declining an invitation to the White House. But for fans to detect a viewpoint from a mainstream sports broadcaster appears to be a novel development. In some cases, ESPN has been accused of putting a thumb on the scale of social debates that are not settled. A galvanizing incident for critics was Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s winning the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs, ESPN\u2019s annual award show, in 2015, after Ms. Jenner, an Olympic gold medalist in the decathlon, came out as transgender. In others, conservative writers like Ben Domenech have cast ESPN\u2019s perceived political approach as flawed simply for its willingness to mingle politics and sports rather than preserving its TV channels and digital platforms as sports-only zones, an escape from society\u2019s headier issues. Even Linda Cohn, a longtime anchor of \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d ESPN\u2019s flagship highlights show, blamed politics for some of the network\u2019s woes. In a radio interview on Thursday, she said, \u201cI felt that the old-school viewers were put in a corner,\u201d adding, \u201cif anyone wants to ignore that fact, they\u2019re blind.\u201d The claim that the layoffs somehow resulted from disenchantment with political bias is likely untrue. Industry analysts have tied ESPN\u2019s job cuts to radically shifting habits of media consumption, notably the fact that millions of people are turning away from cable TV, which for decades has been ESPN\u2019s mother lode for revenue, and to other business-related factors. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of a tangible connection that has expressed itself through any data,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, in reference to theories that a political slant helped cause layoffs. He added, \u201cThere are much more obvious things to point to.\u201d Still, some viewers seized on a rare moment of public vulnerability for ESPN to air their grievances, an echo of Gamergate, a heated dispute that escalated a few years ago when video game reviewers were accused of inappropriately infusing politics and biases on other subjects into their work, leading to a campaign of harassment against those who were derogatorily called Social Justice Warriors. (It is difficult to discern, of course, whether the complaints lodged against ESPN on social media and other digital platforms represented a small or large portion of the network\u2019s viewership.) In The Ringer, the writer Bryan Curtis recently concluded, sympathetically, that sportswriting had become \u201ca liberal profession.\u201d Debates such as whether the Washington Redskins\u2019 name and imagery are offensive, he said, are ones in which most sportswriters consider there to be only one right-thinking side. The conservative writer Michael Brendan Dougherty responded in The Week that sports media\u2019s \u201chegemonic liberalism\u201d puts it \u201cin an antagonistic position not just with fans, but with the entire sports culture beyond journalism.\u201d ESPN\u2019s president, John Skipper, told the network ombudsman last year that ESPN and its parent company, Disney, were committed to \u201cdiversity and inclusion,\u201d and that they \u201cview this not as a political stance but as a human stance.\u201d But conservatives might disagree with Mr. Skipper\u2019s parsing, and Bob Ley, one of ESPN\u2019s longest-tenured anchors, perhaps hinted at one byproduct of ESPN\u2019s \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d when he told the ombudsman, Jim Brady, in reference to gender and racial emphases in personnel: \u201cWe\u2019ve done a great job of diversity. But the one place we have miles to go is diversity of thought.\u201d An ESPN-commissioned study last October found that 28 percent of the network\u2019s consumers believed it was politically biased, according to figures provided by ESPN. Of that 28 percent, 56 percent believed the network was biased in a liberal direction, while 37 percent said it was biased in a conservative direction. Two events in particular polarized viewers against ESPN, according to the study, which was conducted by Langer Research Associates: Ms. Jenner\u2019s receiving her award; and the firing of the analyst Curt Schilling after he ridiculed transgender people in a Facebook post in response to North Carolina\u2019s so-called bathroom bill. The two incidents made 16 percent and 12 percent more viewers, respectively, feel worse about ESPN than better (the majority\u2019s views were unaffected). By contrast, coverage of Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an N.F.L. team, and a town hall in October with President Barack Obama both resulted in slightly more ESPN viewers feeling better about the network than feeling worse, according to ESPN. Clay Travis, a Fox Sports contributor and editor of the website Outkick the Coverage, has labeled the network \u201cMSESPN,\u201d a reference to MSNBC, the cable news channel that frequently skews liberal in its analysis. Giving the courage award to Ms. Jenner, he said in an interview, smacked of \u201csocial engineering\u201d on behalf of ESPN. He has also criticized what he called the \u201clionization\u201d of Mr. Kaepernick. Mr. Pilson, the journalism professor, said he believed that, amid the present political deluge, even sports media outlets could not help but get wet. \u201cPeople are either anticipating, expecting or microwatching sportscasters to see if they can detect any bias,\u201d he said. Barry Blyn, ESPN\u2019s vice president for consumer insights, noted in an interview that ratings for CNN, Fox News and MSNBC have not fallen off since November. \u201cThe election isn\u2019t over,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because it isn\u2019t over, everything is political.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/sports/espn-layoffs-sports-politics-bias.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T13:15:49-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T13:15:49-04:00", "abstract": "Some conservative critics have celebrated ESPN\u2019s struggles, saying its coverage of some issues reveals a left-leaning sensibility.", "title": "Claims of Liberal Bias in Media Now Include Sportscasters, Too"}
