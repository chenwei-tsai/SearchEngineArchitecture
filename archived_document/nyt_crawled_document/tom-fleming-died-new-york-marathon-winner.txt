He was 65. His death, apparently of a heart attack, was announced by Montclair Kimberley Academy in New Jersey, where Mr. Fleming was a fourth-grade teacher and the varsity track and field and cross-country coach. Todd Smith, the academy\u2019s athletic director, said that Mr. Fleming had complained of feeling ill at a meet in Verona, N.J., and was found unconscious near the track in his car, where he had gone to sit. He was pronounced dead at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair. At the height of a sterling career, Mr. Fleming was the top local runner in the New York area in a number of distances. His contemporaries included Frank Shorter, the 1972 Olympic marathon champion, and Bill Rodgers, a four-time winner of both the New York and Boston marathons. Mr. Fleming won New York in 1973 and 1975, when all 26.2 miles of the marathon were run in loops of Central Park. (The race expanded to the five boroughs in 1976.) He also won marathons in Los Angeles, Toronto, Washington and Cleveland and had two second-place finishes in the Boston Marathon and a fifth-place finish at the 1976 Olympic trials. His dedication was summed up in an often-cited quotation: \u201cSomewhere, someone in the world is training when you are not. When you race him, he will win.\u201d Many of today\u2019s elite marathon runners train about 120 miles a week. Mr. Fleming preferred to run 140 to 150, and for at least two weeks during his career he raised the distance to 200. \u201cHe slept, ran, ate, slept, ran, ate,\u201d George Hirsch, the chairman of New York Road Runners, which organizes the city\u2019s marathon, said on Friday. While many elite runners train twice a day, \u201cTom, some days, did three runs, and I know a few days he did four runs,\u201d Mr. Hirsch said. \u201cHe was as tough a runner as I\u2019ve known.\u201d Though Mr. Fleming did not win the race he most coveted \u2014 Boston, the oldest annual marathon \u2014 it was not for lack of determination. After finishing second or third in Boston one year, Mr. Rodgers said on Friday, \u201che went back home and went out that night and trained some more.\u201d In his heyday, Mr. Fleming, a rangy 6 feet 1 inch, raced at 159 pounds. In 2011, he weighed 210, he told an interviewer. Barbara Fleming, his former wife, said in an interview that he had been reluctant to get regular medical checkups, though he had recently lost about 25 pounds. Thomas J. Fleming was born on July 23, 1951, in Long Branch, N.J. A longtime resident of Bloomfield, N.J., he began his running career as a junior at Bloomfield High School and became an all-American at William Paterson College, now William Paterson University. In 1973, during his senior year in college, he competed in a track meet on a Saturday, then ran the Boston Marathon two days later, finishing second. Later that year, he entered the New York City Marathon and finished first. There were only 406 entrants in that race, and Mr. Fleming\u2019s mother and sister rented bikes to follow along as he ran through Central Park. \u201cThey were glad I was running so they could get some exercise,\u201d Mr. Fleming told the writer and coach Gary Cohen. Near the finish line, Mr. Fleming said, a police officer approached his mother and said, \u201cPlease lady, move away,\u201d to which she responded, \u201cHey, that\u2019s my son!\u201d His fastest marathon time, 2 hours 12 minutes 5 seconds, came in a third-place finish in Boston in 1975. In 1977, he finished fourth at the Fukuoka Marathon in Japan, then considered the unofficial world championship. He became an advocate for professional running in an era when Olympians were required to be amateurs and money was paid under the table. Elite marathon runners can now make hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money and appearance fees. Affable and charismatic, Mr. Fleming seemed to have as much passion for coaching as he once did for running. \u201cIt is better to help others,\u201d he said in a 2011 interview with Mr. Cohen. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to take kids who aren\u2019t too good at anything and to help them find the one thing they can do better than most kids.\u201d He is survived by a daughter, Margot, and a son, Connor. By the early 1990s, Mr. Fleming had recorded more than 123,000 miles in his training log. By the end of the decade, he had effectively stopped running, Barbara Fleming said, because \u201che was so used to being on top\u201d and could no longer compete at a high level. \u201cHe was intense,\u201d said Mr. Rodgers, his friend of more than 40 years. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t jog. He had to race.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T23:06:07-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Fleming, a contemporary of Frank Shorter and Bill Rodgers who preferred to train 140 to 150 miles a week, won New York in 1973 and 1975.", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T23:06:07-04:00"}
