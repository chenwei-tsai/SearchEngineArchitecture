Why or why not? \u2014 What do you see as the pros and cons of living in another country for work? \u2014 What does Ms. Mehta\u2019s comparison of the three jobs in Aguascalientes, Detroit and Scranton add, if anything, to her argument for young people being open to working abroad? \u2014 How might Ms. Mehta\u2019s own family\u2019s experiences influence her stance on the issue and the advice she gives about it?
