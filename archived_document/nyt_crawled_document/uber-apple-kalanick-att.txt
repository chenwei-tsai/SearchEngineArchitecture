Cook, in 2015. Uber had been tracking iPhones even after its app had been deleted from the devices and the iPhones themselves had been erased. The practice broke privacy rules at Apple, which insists that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner\u2019s identity remains. Mr. Cook told Mr. Kalanick that if Uber did not stop the tracking, the Uber app would be kicked out of the App Store, a move that would deny access by to millions of iPhone customers, potentially destroying the ride-hailing service\u2019s business. Mr. Kalanick acceded and his company survived. The episode is an example of how, time and again, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded rules and norms, backing down only when caught. Along the way, his efforts to succeed regardless of the cost have created a company culture that has dragged Uber into its most sustained crisis. The New York Times has examined how Mr. Kalanick\u2019s approach of asking for forgiveness rather than permission and relentlessly pursuing goals at other people\u2019s expense has at times put his ride-hailing company on the brink of implosion. As far as AT&T is concerned, it is just a humble telecommunications company, wanting to buy an entertainment business. In a world where megasize media companies are buying each other up, AT&T is the underdog \u2014 or at least, that\u2019s what AT&T wants everyone in Washington to understand. In some parts of the country, however, that argument seems to be undermined: \u2022 In Nashville and in Louisville, Ky., AT&T has been suing to make it harder for broadband providers to use utility poles; \u2022 In Missouri, Tennessee and North Carolina, the company has been pushing for laws that block municipal broadband providers; \u2022 And in San Francisco, it has been pushing back at efforts to open up apartment buildings to more internet service providers. Those actions are among those that may affect the Justice Department\u2019s review of the company\u2019s deal to buy Time Warner. \u201cAntitrust officials may have a hard time buying AT&T\u2019s argument that it will expand broadband competition and not seek to harm competitors if they find the company is actively working to block new broadband players from entering the markets AT&T already dominates,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, the president of Public Knowledge, a consumer group. Mr. Kimmelman is a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, and he opposes the merger. AT&T denies being hypocritical. It says that in the examples cited, it was trying to fight misguided and potentially illegal regulations, while protecting jobs and the quality of its service. \u2022 This could be the week when a long-promised tax cut for Americans is unveiled. President Trump said on Friday that a \u201cmassive\u201d cut would be announced on Wednesday, but gave no further details. Treasury officials seemed to have been taken by surprise by the president\u2019s declaration and had little more to say about it, so the announcement may be about a broad outline rather than a detailed plan. Tax experts say that any overhaul would have to get rid of certain deductions for business if it is not to starve the Treasury. The main roadblock, though, comes from a sector that the president knows well: the real estate industry.", "published_date": "2017-04-23T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "abstract": "Time and again, Travis Kalanick, the chief of the ride-hailing service, has openly disregarded existing rules and norms, backing down only when caught.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/business/dealbook/uber-apple-kalanick-att.html", "source": "The New York Times"}
