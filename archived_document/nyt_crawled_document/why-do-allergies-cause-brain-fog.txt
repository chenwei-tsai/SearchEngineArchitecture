When I have allergies or a cold, I find it difficult to think. How does sinus congestion affect the brain?  A. The short answer is no one really knows why people often report feeling \u201cfuzzy headed\u201d when they have allergies or a cold. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you could demonstrate on a test or scan,\u201d said Dr. Richard Lebowitz, a rhinologist and otolaryngologist at NYU Langone Medical Center. But the condition is real. Children with untreated allergies perform worse in school than others, research has found, in part because allergies can interrupt sleep and make children feel tired, but other factors may be involved as well. Young students\u2019 grades improve when their allergies are treated with nonsedating, long-acting medication, studies suggest. \u201cThe thought is allergies are essentially inflammation in the nose and sinuses,\u201d said Dr. Mark Aronica, an allergist at the Cleveland Clinic. This inflammation triggers the release of proteins called cytokines as part of the immune response. The same process happens when you have a cold. \u201cThese cytokines are there to help fight infection, and also have an impact on our ability to think and function and perform,\u201d Dr. Aronica said. The result is that people with allergies or a bad cold often feel as if they are seeing the world through cheesecloth. The immune response can also contribute to fatigue. With allergies that are triggered for weeks or months at a time, \u201csleeping off\u201d that exhaustion isn\u2019t feasible, so treating the allergies is the best approach, Dr. Aronica said. \u201cIf you control the symptoms, that brain fog may go away.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T06:05:13-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/well/live/why-do-allergies-cause-brain-fog.html", "item_type": "Article"}
