{"text": "Welcome to Times Insider Events \u2014 live programming for Times Insiders and their guests. Times Insider offers behind-the-scenes insights into news, features and opinion at The New York Times. Canadians have responded to the global refugee crisis in a uniquely personal way, sponsoring thousands of Syrian families. At The New York Times, we documented this national movement in a four-part series, \u201cRefugees Welcome.\u201d Please join us as we take you behind the scenes of our journalism, with a discussion of how we documented private sponsorship \u2014 and what can be learned from Canada\u2019s approach. Catherine Porter, The Times\u2019s Toronto bureau chief, will moderate a conversation featuring Jodi Kantor and Catrin Einhorn, two Times journalists, and Ahmed Hussen, Canada\u2019s immigration minister.
