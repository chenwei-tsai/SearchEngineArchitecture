In this case it was Ayanna Ross, who was 11 when she met Shawn Martinbrough, also 11, in the 1980s at Summer Pines Day Camp in New Rochelle, N.Y. \u201cIt was very clear Ayanna liked me,\u201d said Mr. Martinbrough, 45, a native of the Bronx and an illustrator for DC Comics, Image Comics and Marvel Entertainment. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get the memo we were dating. She was very pushy. We would hang out, but there was never a commitment.\u201d This was news to Ms. Ross, who insisted the two were a thing. \u201cI was drawn to him instantly; I remember loving the way his skin smelled,\u201d said Ms. Ross, 44, who grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and is a lawyer in Washington, where the couple live. \u201cI knew he liked me because he followed me everywhere. When we did out-of-camp excursions, he always wanted to be on my team. I don\u2019t see where he could have thought he wasn\u2019t my boyfriend.\u201d Ms. Ross wasn\u2019t alone in her thinking. Mr. Martinbrough had similar feelings, said his childhood friend Noel Estrada. \u201cShawn was interested, whether he wants to admit it or not,\u201d Mr. Estrada, 44, said. \u201cHe told me he thought she was pretty. As kids, we\u2019d have sleepovers and prank-call Ayanna. We didn\u2019t have texting or Snapchat, and back then that\u2019s how silly boys showed their interest and tried to get a girl\u2019s attention.\u201d A shorter, and more traumatic, exchange played out when the two, unbeknown to each other, ended up attending Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School in Manhattan; she for dance, he for art. \u201cDuring my first month, I saw him with a group of friends standing on the sidewalk,\u201d Ms. Ross said. \u201cHe was taller, and I thought, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s my boyfriend.\u2019 It was like no time had passed. We hadn\u2019t kept in touch, but I still thought we were dating, so I went up to him, said hi and asked if I could wear his jacket. He said, \u2018O.K.\u2019 I\u2019d seen \u2018Grease,\u2019 so I thought: \u2018Cool. I\u2019m his girlfriend.\u2019\u201d With jacket in tow, she rejoined her pals. Shortly after, Mr. Martinbrough sent one of his buddies to retrieve it. The relationship ended there. Ms. Ross threw the jacket at his friend. A week later, she was dating a senior. \u201cI felt really dejected,\u201d she said. \u201cHe should have come over and gotten it himself. The jacket incident shaped my interactions with potential dates to come. I developed a very thick skin, and after that I never called any boy. If someone was interested, they would have to be the initiator.\u201d Mr. Martinbrough\u2019s reaction was less dramatic. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be bothered,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a late bloomer. I was into Japanese animation and comic books.\u201d Over the years, however, he found himself wondering if she was the one who got away. \u201cWhat if I had taken her up on her offer?\u201d he said. \u201cI looked for her on the web, but I wasn\u2019t sure how she spelled her name, so I could never find her.\u201d They went to different colleges, and Mr. Martinbrough met his first wife at his. The couple divorced in 2001, after eight years of marriage. By then, he was living in Washington and drawing for DC Comics. Ms. Ross had also moved on. She was living on the Upper East Side, working as an assistant district attorney and dating someone she had met in law school. Chance brought them together in 2008, when Mr. Martinbrough spotted Ms. Ross at a book party at the restaurant Barna, now closed, on Park Avenue South. He had returned to New York to visit his family and was supposed to attend the event with his sister, who unexpectedly had to work late and couldn\u2019t go. Mr. Martinbrough had been working relentlessly on an illustration project. This was his first social outing in months, so he decided to go alone. \u201cI was getting my coat from coat check, and I see this cute woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was Ayanna but wasn\u2019t sure. When I turned around, she was standing in front of me. It was her, but she didn\u2019t recognize me. I tried to explain how I knew her, and she didn\u2019t believe me until I mentioned the jacket and camp.\u201d It was true. She had no idea who he was. \u201cI saw this tall, muscular guy by coat check,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Sex on a Platter\u2019 started playing in my head as I saw myself and my life and everything, like a movie. When I got close enough to him, he said, \u2018I think I know you.\u2019 He pronounced my name correctly [a-wanna], which no one does.\u201d She then believed he really must have known her. Numbers were exchanged. That night, Mr. Martinbrough couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. While visiting his father the next day, his cellphone rang. Ms. Ross, who had finally remembered him and broken her \u201cI\u2019m not calling you, you have to call me\u201d rule, was on the line. \u201cI\u2019d never done that before,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that I called the one guy who made me not want to be the aggressor because of what he did years ago.\u201d This time, Mr. Martinbrough wasn\u2019t turned off but rather fond of her forwardness, which he now found refreshing. \u201cShe beat me to the punch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things I love about her. I didn\u2019t view her as pushy anymore because we were grown up. I thought she was charming.\u201d They met for dinner. The next day it was lunch. Then again that same evening. Ms. Ross had to leave the next morning for Las Vegas. Mr. Martinbrough watched her pack. They talked all night. Neither went to sleep. Then he drove her to the airport. He extended his stay in New York by a week and was waiting at the arrivals hall for her when she returned. The roles had finally switched. \u201cI knew I wanted to marry her in the first month,\u201d Mr. Martinbrough said, \u201cbut having been married before, I swore I\u2019d wait at least three years into a relationship before doing it again.\u201d And although things between them moved fast, Ms. Ross didn\u2019t mind. She liked the man he had become. Over the next six years, they became inseparable and took turns visiting each other over the weekends. Finally, sick of the commute, Ms. Ross moved in with Mr. Martinbrough. On one of the unluckiest days of the year, Friday, Dec. 13, 2013, he proposed. Ms. Ross immediately said yes. Not everyone was alerted to the early love story. \u201cI had no idea she had a crush on him; we were just kids,\u201d said Douglas Coleman, 44, who was also a camper at Summer Pines that year. \u201cWhen they started dating and Shawn reintroduced me to her, he said, \u2018Do you realize who this is?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it. To know they found each other, and that they\u2019re getting married, is fate. You have to give that some credibility.\u201d Mr. Estrada added: \u201cAyanna\u2019s very good for Shawn. She\u2019s smart, and she challenges him. He really feels like his life has come together.\u201d Before their wedding, several snafus happened: They received a text message that the three-piece student band they had hired, to pay tribute to their high school, was not coming; the Vera Wang suit Mr. Martinbrough had rented didn\u2019t fit; and Ms. Ross forgot the music for their cocktail hour. Then there was the weather. It didn\u2019t just rain, it poured. All day. Nonstop. The couple had rented the Sunset Terrace at the Chelsea Piers in Manhattan specifically for the sunset and the outdoor accessibility. They fixed what they could. They hired a flutist. The groom wore a Calvin Klein suit from his closet. Ms. Ross\u2019s niece became the musical backup, plugging her iPhone into the speaker system. And the rain, well, that was out of their hands. \u201cI really wanted to kiss Shawn at 7:02, when the sun was supposed to set,\u201d said a very calm Ms. Ross, who was taking a quiet moment before heading downstairs to greet guests. The groom was just as calm, and remained optimistic. \u201cRain is good luck,\u201d he said, looking at his bride. \u201cThe two of us are here together celebrating our love. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Ms. Ross, touched by his words, agreed. \u201cThere will be a silver lining,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of a sunset, something cool will happen during the ceremony.\u201d The couple was married at 7:08 \u2014 six minutes later than scheduled \u2014 on Friday, March 31. The Rev. Sheldon Williams of the Co-Op City Baptist Church officiated in front of 75 guests. \u201cHe was my grandmother\u2019s pastor,\u201d Mr. Martinbrough said. \u201cShe passed away last year, so having him do our service is like having her with us.\u201d And though the new Mrs. Ross-Martinbrough didn\u2019t get her sunset, she did get her silver lining: She married the love of her life. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. that we didn\u2019t have the sunset,\u201d she said. \u201cShawn is my sunlight. He lights up my heart.\u201d Mr. Williams pronounced them husband and wife, and as they began to kiss, a large boat made a surprise appearance, seemingly from nowhere. She found her inspiration. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re supposed to go on and sail off,\u201d she said, \u201cand that we\u2019ll be doing big things together.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T06:00:26-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/fashion/weddings/still-in-love-with-comic-books-and-now-with-her-too.html", "item_type": "Article"}
