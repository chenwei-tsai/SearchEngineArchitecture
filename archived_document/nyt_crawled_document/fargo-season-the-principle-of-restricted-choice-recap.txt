{"text": "\u201cUnfathomable pinhead-ery.\u201d That\u2019s how Nikki Swango describes the likely official assessment of Ennis Stussy\u2019s murder, on the long odds that the police are led to Maurice LeFay, the bungling (and now dead) parolee. Longer still, she reckons, are the odds they\u2019re led back to her and to Ray Stussy (unrelated), who blackmailed LeFay into committing a crime and thus initiated the chain of events leading to all this chaos. And she\u2019s right, at least insofar as it applies to the unfathomable pinhead-ery she knows, which is that Maurice drove to the wrong Stussy house and killed its resident for indiscernible reasons. What she can\u2019t account for is the extent of the unfathomable pinhead-ery she doesn\u2019t know, which is likely to leave the authorities with a lot more evidence leading back to them, including a gas-station phone book with Ennis\u2019s page ripped out of it. The phrase also neatly encapsulates where we are in \u201cFargo\u201d so far. Unfathomable pinhead-ery has been a feature of \u201cFargo\u201d since Jerry Lundegaard hired a couple of lowlifes to kidnap his wife in the original Coen brothers movie, and we\u2019re already seeing the needless pileup of bodies that results from a petty criminal scheme gone amiss. What we\u2019re not seeing yet is the counterbalance of human decency and moral certitude that\u2019s also important to what could now, in the parlance of our times, be called the \u201cFargo\u201d brand. That typically arises from the Marge Gunderson character \u2014 in this case, Carrie Coon\u2019s Gloria Burgle \u2014 but she hasn\u2019t enjoyed enough meaningful screen time to establish that balance. In his review of the third season, the Times\u2019s James Poniewozik calls it \u201can expertly made meta-concoction, a remix of a remix,\u201d which is certainly true of the first two episodes (the only ones made available to critics so far) and may ultimately be true of the whole thing. There\u2019s a hollowness to the action so far that gives oxygen to the series\u2019s (and the original movie\u2019s) toughest critics, who might fairly dismiss it as a glib rendering of criminal stupidity and Midwestern anthropology. But two hours of a 10-hour narrative isn\u2019t a significant enough sample size to take an adequate measure of the season unless the pattern repeats itself the rest of the way. Perhaps the soul has not yet been revealed. Perhaps it has no soul. Such things take time. As a plot machine, however, \u201cFargo\u201d remains top-notch, and the current cast may be the best the show has assembled. Ewan McGregor\u2019s dual role has been getting most of the attention so far, but Mary-Elizabeth Winstead\u2019s work as Nikki has been the bigger standout \u2014 in part because of Winstead\u2019s unwavering confidence as a femme fatale, but also because Nikki isn\u2019t quite as smart as her own measure. Compared with Ray, Maurice and the other losers in her orbit, Nikki is a criminal mastermind of Keyser Soze proportions, and we\u2019ve seen her react quickly and instinctually in threatening situations, like using her body in an attempt to figuratively and literally disarm Maurice or calculating the precise trajectory of a fatal air-conditioning unit. Yet Nikki is given to the same impulsive pinhead-ery that gets everyone in trouble in the \u201cFargo\u201d-verse. It\u2019s Nikki who convinces Ray to take a second shot at stealing his brother\u2019s two-cent stamp, without regard to the first attempt\u2019s possibly coming back to haunt them. And it\u2019s Nikki who, in a fit of anger over a perceived show of disrespect from Emmit, promptly pulls down her pants and leaves a saturated tampon in his desk drawer. The original plan to have Ray distract his brother while Nikki took the stamp is dumb enough \u2014 and the motive, to \u201cunblock\u201d his chi, even dumber \u2014 but there\u2019s no strategic purpose in this gesture, which will just leave the brothers further estranged. Perhaps there\u2019s a reason Nikki Swango wound up on parole in the first place. But Emmit has bigger problems than Nikki. The mysterious V. M. Varga (David Thewlis) has clarified that the million dollars Emmit and Sy thought was a loan was, in fact, an investment in a massive money-laundering operation that they can do nothing to stop. Their lawyer, Irv Blumkin, the most Irv Blumkin-looking man alive, tries to dig up some dirt on Varga, but all it takes is a Google phishing scam for Varga to identify him and have him hoisted off a parking deck. Although Thewlis\u2019s mirthless cackle doesn\u2019t approximate the dead-eyed menace of Javier Bardem\u2019s Anton Chigurh in \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d or of Billy Bob Thornton in the first season, Varga is another Chigurh type, a source of unrelenting and impenetrable evil. No Google search will fill in that blank space of man. That leaves Gloria to restore some order to the universe, but she\u2019s seeking justice at about a tenth of the pace that injustices are being carried out. The Eden Valley Police Department is currently just an open table at the library, and her only jail cell is a storage room packed with unused computers. Her boss, Moe Dammick, wants to bring her under his watch in the county system, but there\u2019s no evidence he has much confidence in her. After all, she\u2019s still sending reports via Telex and wonders why nobody ever writes her back. That last detail is concerning: Eden Valley may be a mostly crime-free place where residents feel comfortable leaving their front doors unlocked, but Gloria does live in the 21st century. Her inability to crack the mystery of her unanswered Telex reports could, in uncharitable terms, be described as \u201cunfathomable pinhead-ery.\u201d 3 Cent Stamps:  \u2022 Ennis Stussy\u2019s former life as the sci-fi scribe Thaddeus Mobley opens up an intriguing new angle, but for now we can only gaze longingly at paperbacks with titles like \u201cToronto Cain: Psychic Ranger\u201d and \u201cThe Plague Monkey\u201d and wish they existed in the real world. \u2022 For those compelled by the F.C.U. \u2014 the Fargo Cinematic Universe \u2014 Sy\u2019s mention of Stan Grossman builds a bridge between the third season of \u201cFargo\u201d and Sy\u2019s analog in the Coen brothers movie. (Another Stan Grossman, played by Bryan Cranston, appears in the indie hit \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d but things are confusing enough without bringing him on board.) \u2022 Frozen concentrated orange juice: Can you make meth from that? \u2022 Line of the night, from Nikki after Ray sadly notes that he\u2019s never killed anyone before: \u201cMe, neither. Life\u2019s a journey.\u201d Winstead\u2019s nonchalance sells it. \u2022 Three \u201cBig Lebowski\u201d references: 1. Gloria and her son meeting with the director of a funeral parlor over her stepfather\u2019s remains. The conversation leads to a discreet mention of choosing \u201cthe vessel\u201d of choice. 2. Ray\u2019s shoes don\u2019t match because errant parolee urine tests have ruined their pairs. His use of the word \u201cmicturated\u201d recalls the Big Lebowski\u2019s huffy response to the Dude\u2019s complaints about men peeing on his rug. 3. Sy smashing Ray\u2019s car repeatedly with the Hummer continues a running joke similar to the Dude\u2019s car\u2019s getting smashed to bits in \u201cThe Big Lebowski.\u201d Expect Ray\u2019s Corvette to live to fight another day.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/television/fargo-season-the-principle-of-restricted-choice-recap.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T23:00:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-26T23:00:06-04:00", "abstract": "Nikki\u2019s description of the blunders she knows about is dead-on.
