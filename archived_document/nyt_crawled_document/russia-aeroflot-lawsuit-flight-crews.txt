The event took a bizarre twist, however, as two men defending the airline interrupted the proceedings to upbraid the two employees, talking about one\u2019s breast size, and undercutting repeated assertions from Aeroflot that it had not discriminated by arguing that attractive flight staff were important for business. Both sides focused on what they said was a move by Aeroflot in 2016 to enforce weight guidelines for its cabin staff, suggesting that women fit into a maximum clothing size of 48, equivalent to a 14 in the United States. Men were allowed somewhat more weight, according to an independent union representative. The two women, Evgeniya V. Magurina and Irina N. Ierusalimskaya, who sued separately, said they were barred from international flights, losing a significant chunk of their potential paychecks, because their clothing sizes were larger. (Ms. Magurina said hers is 52.) Ms. Magurina told the news conference that she wanted to know why her \u201cprofessional success\u201d was tied to her clothing size. The two women \u2014 one of whom had worked for the carrier for 26 years \u2014 lost their initial court cases and had called the news conference to announce that they would appeal. Pavel V. Danilin, a journalist, and Nikita A. Krichevskiy, an economist, both speaking for the Aeroflot Public Council, loudly enunciated several reasons they thought the guidelines should be followed. The advisory council works at the behest of the company, but its 25 members are not paid and are not official spokesmen for the airline. First, Aeroflot was striving to join the ranks of the top 10 airlines in the world so the appearance of the cabin staff mattered because customers want pretty flight attendants, they said. (One wag on Twitter suggested the food might be a more productive place to concentrate first.) Second, of some 600 cabin attendants informed that they were overweight, only about 50 failed to lose the extra pounds. Third, heavy flight attendants would present a danger in any emergency situation and the women should be grateful that the airline took an interest in their health, they said. There was also some discussion of an argument that the airline had made \u2014 that planes carrying heavier employees cost the company more in fuel consumption. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the requirement of wearing size 42-48 is considered so unworkable,\u201d said Mr. Krichevskiy, adding that he had shed 20 kilograms in recent years. As the discussion grew heated, Mr. Krichevskiy accused Ms. Magurina of bragging about her body during court hearings. \u201cShe said she had big breasts which served her well throughout her life, and more recently started doing her a disservice,\u201d he said. The two women shook their heads in disbelief, but did not respond directly. Aeroflot, which has earned high marks in recent years for shedding its Soviet skin to become a fairly efficient, friendly airline, quickly tried to distance itself from the proceedings. Aeroflot issued a statement noting that the Public Council meets twice a year and that opinions of its members do not necessarily represent the views of Aeroflot. \u201cN. Krichevskiy and P. Danilin were expressing their personal opinions,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey are public figures and on their own initiative expressed the desire to take part in today\u2019s press conference. Aeroflot\u2019s position was set out in the Court, which rejected the claims brought by Magurina and Ierusalimskaya against Aeroflot.\u201d The two men had cited a passenger survey in which passengers overwhelmingly stated a preference for attractive cabin crews, and the airline\u2019s public relations agency in London sent it out again on Tuesday. Every Aeroflot flight starts with a video of three women in the airline\u2019s trademark orange uniforms embroidered with a flying hammer and sickle gliding through an airport, and many new employees of both sexes seem to have been hired with young glamour in mind. \u201cAs it was stated in court, Aeroflot\u2019s requirements for sizes and weight are strictly in compliance with Russian law,\u201d the company said in response to questions. \u201cThe flight attendants are not being discriminated against, as has been demonstrated in two court cases that were ruled upon in Aeroflot\u2019s favor this month.\u201d Last February, when the allegations by cabin crew members were first raised publicly, Aeroflot issued a statement denying any discrimination based on age or appearance. \u201cThe claim that the expert medical commission has been instructed to remove \u2018old and ugly\u2019 cabin crew from flight duties is untrue,\u201d the statement said. The fight reflects the struggle throughout Russia to win equal treatment for men and women, including equal pay, said Ksenia A. Mihaylichenko, the lawyer for both women. \u201cOnly professional qualities should be counted,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/world/europe/russia-aeroflot-lawsuit-flight-crews.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:29:57-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "Aeroflot Workers Are Told Passengers Want Attractive Flight Crews", "item_type": "Article"}
