{"abstract": "Here\u2019s what you need to know at the end of the day.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here\u2019s the latest. 1. Call it the saga of the wayward warships. News that President Trump was sending a Navy strike force into the Sea of Japan last week fanned fears of a pre-emptive military strike on North Korea. But the carrier and other ships were actually sailing in the opposite direction \u2014 a fact that came to light only after the photograph above was posted online by the Navy. The carrier is now heading to the Sea of Japan. It should arrive sometime next week. _____ 2. It was everyone\u2019s favorite day: Tax Day. On a more serious note: It looks like President Trump\u2019s efforts to overhaul the U.S. tax code are in serious jeopardy. The Democrats insist they won\u2019t cooperate on it unless Mr. Trump releases his own. If you\u2019re wondering where your tax money goes, Steve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, unveiled a new website to answer that question. Above, a protest outside an I.R.S. office in Manhattan. _____ 3. \u201cIt\u2019s America First, you better believe it.\u201d As he nears 100 days in office, President Trump spoke at a Wisconsin factory about an executive order authorizing studies and tweaks in government rules that could lead to restrictions on H-1B visas for foreign workers. There are signs he\u2019s drifting away from the populist, anti-establishment ideas that guided his campaign. We\u2019ve also gathered a selection of partisan writing you shouldn\u2019t miss. _____ 4. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain announced that she was reversing course and calling an early election. She\u2019s making a risky bet that voters will give her a strong mandate as she negotiates the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. The vote will be held June 8. And the first round of voting in France\u2019s presidential election starts Sunday. Critics are worried that Russia may be meddling in the election to bolster favored candidates. _____ 5. The man suspected of fatally shooting a Cleveland man and then posting video of the killing on Facebook is dead. Steve Stephens shot himself as he was chased by the police near Erie, Pa., the authorities said. The pursuit began when a McDonald\u2019s worker stalled him by holding on to his fries \u2014 and calling the police. _____ 6. Voters in a wealthy suburban district in Georgia are going to the polls to fill the seat vacated by former Representative Tom Price, who is now the health and human services secretary. There are 18 candidates to replace him, and the front-runner is a bit of a surprise. Jon Ossoff is a 30-year-old Democrat and filmmaker whose slogan is \u201cMake Trump Furious.\u201d _____ 7. In Arkansas, two executions that were set to be carried out yesterday were delayed, one at the 11th hour. They were among eight executions scheduled over 10 days this month. Others are scheduled for this Thursday and Monday. The legal challenges and protests continue, including over the lethal-injection cocktail the state plans to use. _____ 8. We visited two heavily patrolled borders that have become hot spots in the global refugee crisis \u2014 between the U.S. and Mexico, and Hungary and Serbia. In southeastern Texas, the Border Patrol agents monitor the banks of the Rio Grande on horseback for drug smugglers and migrants, many of whom are Central Americans seeking asylum. Hungary, above, which heavily fortified its border over the last two years, is letting in just a handful of asylum seekers these days, and putting them in detention centers while their cases are decided. _____ 9. In Hollywood, TV and movie writers begin voting tomorrow on whether to strike over raises and health benefits. If no deal is reached between the Writers Guild of America and studios by May 1, they\u2019ll stop work the next day, forcing the late-night comedy shows to immediately start running reruns. That means we\u2019d be without bits like the one Jimmy Fallon had about the White House Easter Egg Roll: \u201cThat bunny took a look at Trump and said, \u2018Oh my God, a talking carrot!\u2019\u201d Above, a scene from the last strike, in 2007-2008, which lasted 100 days. _____ 10. Finally, it\u2019s springtime in Transylvania. Take a peek at this Hungarian village in Romania where they still celebrate a centuries-old seasonal tradition. On Easter Monday, young men \u201cwater\u201d young women like flowers, dousing them with freshly drawn well water and patchouli to bring them health, beauty and love. Have a great night. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.
