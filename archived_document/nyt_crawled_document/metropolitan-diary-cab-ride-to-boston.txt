One Sunday morning around 1965, he arrived at our apartment in Queens with his customary bag of fresh, hot bagels, but at 6:30 a.m., six hours later than usual. My mother, of course, had been up for hours, worrying and walking the halls. He announced that he had had a fare to Boston and had made $300. He regaled us with the story of the passenger, a young woman who, with her enormous German shepherd, had hailed him in the East Village and had said she had to get to Boston that night to visit her boyfriend. We all laughed when he described how the dog licked his neck along the way. It was all funny until my mother, the bookkeeper of the family, asked for the $300. \u201cI have her check,\u201d my father said. \u201cA check?\u201d my mother said. \u201cA check? You took a check for $300 from a total stranger?\u201d All that day he was the brunt of our jokes about his being a chump. At 9 a.m. sharp on Monday, he met with the manager of the bank the check was drawn on. The manger approved the check and asked my father what it was for. When my father told him, the bank manager replied: \u201cOh, that\u2019s better. Last time she hired a plane to fly to Chicago.\u201d", "abstract": "A woman pays for a particularly long fare with a check."}
