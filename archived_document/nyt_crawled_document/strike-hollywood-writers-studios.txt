{"text": "The clock is ticking. As early as Tuesday, television and movie writers could go on strike, creating the first major work stoppage in the entertainment industry in a decade. The effects could be immediate. \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which is having one of its most successful seasons in recent years, would go dark, leaving the show\u2019s final three episodes in limbo. Late-night programs like Samantha Bee\u2019s weekly \u201cFull Frontal\u201d on TBS and CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d would be forced to air repeats. The broadcast networks would also have to deal with the awkward affair at their annual upfront presentations in mid-May, with star-studded events aimed at attracting advertisers potentially marred by picket lines and protests. But will any of this actually happen? The Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, have declined to comment on the state of negotiations while adhering to a news media blackout. But people briefed on the talks, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings, said that despite progress on some sticking points like health care benefits, a deal remained elusive and that negotiations would probably keep Hollywood in suspense until the final minute. The guild\u2019s contract expires at midnight Pacific time on Monday. Among the writers\u2019 other requests, they want studios to adjust the formulas that determine pay, especially for cable network and streaming-service shows. Studios are concerned about setting a precedent for talks with other unions, most notably SAG-Aftra, which represents actors and is to begin negotiating a new contract in two weeks. (The actors\u2019 contract expires on June 30.) But as tension rises \u2014 studios were expected to begin informing employees on Friday that a writers\u2019 strike was possible \u2014 some senior writers, labor lawyers and longtime agents cited differences between the current environment and the circumstances of the last walkout as reason to hope a deal could be reached. There are key distinctions between the talks taking place now and the 2007 discussions between producers and writers that led to a 100-day strike. Back then, there was a profound question on the table for writers: What was their place in a digital future? The streaming era had yet to arrive \u2014 YouTube was only two years old \u2014 but writers wanted studios to carve out a robust compensation formula for programs distributed digitally. Studios, pointing to an uncertain future, wanted to limit payments. In particular, studios wanted to base residual fees for the reuse of programming online (say, reruns of old comedies) on a home video formula established in the early 1980s. The proposal enraged writers. They had long resented the VHS and DVD residuals system, describing it almost from the moment they agreed to it as unfair. The writers\u2019 unions saw the offer on digital programming as an attempt by studios to continue cheating them; most felt they had no choice but to take a stand. As the talks grew increasingly acrimonious and a federal mediator was brought in, studios and networks developed elaborate contingency plans, including stockpiling scripts and ordering reality programming to serve as filler. For the most part, television networks were still operating from a position of strength; the decades-old television ecosystem \u2014 viewers tuning in at specific times and watching commercials; reruns delivering decent ratings \u2014 was more or less intact. This time, negotiators are locking horns over more routine employment matters, including the shoring up of a faltering health care plan. The talks have been tense but not openly hostile. A federal mediator has not stepped in. And production companies have done almost nothing to prepare for a strike, which seems to signal that they may ultimately be prepared to offer a deal palatable to the writers. Major media companies, while still generating enormous profits, are more vulnerable than they were in 2007. Most of the broadcast networks now attract only a small percentage of the viewers they did then. Cable networks are hurting as a result of cord-cutting by consumers. Two major movie studios, Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures, are struggling because of a dearth of blockbusters. The DVD format is on life support. Practically speaking, ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC would not be affected in prime time unless the strike bled into June. That is because production has mostly ended for the season, and writers have not yet begun to work on new series for the fall. A strike that lasted more than a month, however, could delay shows planned for the coming season. Likewise, for cable networks and streaming services, shows that are scheduled to premiere over the next two months should be fine. But series that debut in the summer? Several of those are still shooting, and would probably be held up. One wrinkle involves showrunners. In the past 10 years, as scripted TV has boomed \u2014 there were around 200 shows broadcast during the period of the last strike compared with over 450 released in 2016 \u2014 studios have aggressively courted big-name writers and showrunners like Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy. If major showrunners wanted to delay the premieres of shows in solidarity with writers, network executives dedicated to keeping them happy might be forced to listen \u2014 a prospect that would have seemed unthinkable a decade ago. If, say, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss wanted to delay the July premiere of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to show support for the writers, HBO executives could be in an awkward position. They have a business to run, but they also need to keep their star creators happy. For now, networks are mostly concerned about a strike affecting their late-night shows. Though the ratings for such shows are down from where they stood years ago, the programs are experiencing a cultural currency they have not enjoyed in a long time. Hosts like Mr. Colbert, John Oliver of HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d and Trevor Noah of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d have become appointment television for disaffected liberals craving an antidote to President Trump. The alarm at film companies has been mostly confined to marketing and publicity departments. The late-night sofa is an important promotional perch. What if the stars of May releases like \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword\u201dand \u201cBaywatch\u201d were unable to drop by \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d to tout their latest wares with Jimmy Fallon? The impact on movie production would be minimal. Most television series work on a just-in-time system of script delivery. Writers then commonly tweak jokes and dialogue as filming takes place. But most studio movies are assembled years in advance because the postproduction process \u2014 like digitally rendering entire cities \u2014 takes so long. \u201cNone of the 2018 movies will be affected,\u201d Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, told reporters in mid-April, referring to films like \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Infinity War.\u201d \u201cMost of them are set. What it would really impact is future work on future projects.\u201d A strike of more than a couple months could, however, hurt future movies, particularly those with Oscar aspirations, as studios move forward with production on scripts that are not quite up to snuff. During the last strike, several films required last-minute script doctoring but studios were out of luck. The James Bond movie \u201cQuantum of Solace\u201d was one. Daniel Craig, who played 007, later said of the predicament, \u201cThere was me trying to rewrite scenes \u2014 and a writer I\u2019m not.\u201d Similarly, the director Michael Bay blamed the poor critical reception of his \u201cTransformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen\u201d on the 2007 walkout. \u201cIt was very hard to put it together that quickly after the writers\u2019 strike,\u201d Mr. Bay told Empire magazine in 2011. \u201cIt was just terrible to do a movie where you\u2019ve got to have a story in three weeks.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/media/strike-hollywood-writers-studios.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T18:11:34-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T18:11:34-04:00", "abstract": "By Tuesday, TV and movie writers could create the entertainment industry\u2019s first major work stoppage in a decade.
