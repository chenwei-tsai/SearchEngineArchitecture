{"text": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Larry Bird made the decision last year. After nearly 40 years in the N.B.A., he had started plotting an exit strategy. Bird, a 60-year-old Hall of Famer, finally told the rest of the world Monday: He was stepping down as the Indiana Pacers\u2019 president for basketball operations, turning the reins over to Kevin Pritchard and remaining in the organization as a scout and consultant. \u201cMaybe when I turn 70, I\u2019ll come back,\u201d Bird joked. \u201cBut right now, my wife is happy. She\u2019s been on this run since I was a sophomore in college.\u201d Bird\u2019s story is well known to millions \u2014 the small-town prep star who led Indiana State to the 1979 N.C.A.A. championship game against Magic Johnson and Michigan State, won three Most Valuable Player Awards and three N.B.A. titles in Boston, and then helped the Dream Team capture Olympic gold in 1992. In August 1992, the man nicknamed Larry Legend and the Hick from French Lick, a reference to his Indiana hometown, retired as a player but remained with the Celtics as a special assistant until the Pacers offered him their head-coaching position in 1997. Bird took the Pacers to the Eastern Conference finals three straight times and was named the league\u2019s coach of the year in his debut season. A heart ailment prompted Bird to follow through on another promise \u2014 that he would coach only three seasons. He walked away weeks after Indiana lost to the Lakers in the 2000 finals. Three years later, a rejuvenated and healthier Bird returned to the team as the president for basketball operations. This time, Bird put together teams that went to three more conference finals and earned him the N.B.A.\u2019s Executive of the Year Award in 2011-12. Bird is the only person in league history to be named an M.V.P. and coach and executive of the year. His one shortcoming: He did not bring an N.B.A. title to Indiana. Bird explained that he informed the team owner Herb Simon last summer that he had signed his final contract to run the team. Then Bird called two confidantes into his office \u2014 Pritchard and Peter Dinwiddie, the Pacers\u2019 vice president for basketball operations \u2014 and repeated the message. Bird said almost nobody else knew until word first leaked of his impending departure on Friday. \u201cThis is not a shock to me, as Larry has always been upfront about someday stepping down,\u201d Simon said. \u201cI thank him for all that he has done and am very pleased he is remaining with the Pacers in a different capacity.\u201d It is the second time in five years Bird has given up Indiana\u2019s top front-office job, and it will not be easy for Pritchard to replace a basketball icon like Bird. Pritchard has the advantage of working side by side with Bird and the Indiana front-office adviser Donnie Walsh for five seasons. \u201cGood luck,\u201d Bird joked as he walked off the dais on Monday. When Pritchard sat down, he quipped, \u201cWow, this seat already feels a little hot.\u201d Pritchard went on: \u201cWhat do you say to someone who absolutely gave you the opportunity of a lifetime? I\u2019ve learned so much from him. He has a foundation at which you have to play, and you have to play tough and you have to play selfless.\u201d Pritchard said he would look for those traits in new players, too. First, though, he must sort through the uncertainties of what will be a crucial off-season for the Pacers. Point guard Jeff Teague can become a free agent, and Indiana still does not know if the four-time All-Star Paul George intends to stay when his contract expires at the end of next season. Two years ago, Bird switched the Pacers from a traditional power team to one that favored \u201csmall ball,\u201d which George publicly opposed. Bird finally told reporters that George would do whatever was asked. The experiment did not last long, as the Pacers\u2019 coach at the time, Frank Vogel, moved George back to small forward early the next season. After that season ended, Bird let Vogel walk away, a move many fans criticized. Bird came under even more scrutiny last season when a series of bold off-season moves did not pan out as expected. Indiana had to win its final five regular-season games just to make the playoffs, then was swept in a four-game series for the first time, by the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers. Now Bird is gone, the Pacers are in flux, and Pritchard will have to deal with it.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/sports/indiana-pacers-larry-bird-exit.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T19:37:01-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T19:37:01-04:00", "abstract": "Bird, who is stepping down as the Indiana Pacers\u2019 president for basketball operations, told the team owner Herb Simon and other executives last summer that he wouldn\u2019t sign another contract.", "title": "Larry Bird\u2019s Departure Wasn\u2019t Spur of the Moment"}
