{"text": "PARIS \u2014 Marine Le Pen, the far-right presidential candidate in France, was battling accusations on Tuesday that she had plagiarized sections of a speech by her conservative former opponent, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, at her May Day rally. Supporters of Ms. Le Pen, who is seeking to broaden her appeal with French voters ahead of the second round of the presidential election on  Sunday, said that she had merely \u201cwinked\u201d at voters with remarks that amounted to a \u201csmall loan.\u201d Ms. Le Pen\u2019s efforts have focused in part on convincing voters who backed Mr. Fillon in the first round of the election to choose her over Emmanuel Macron, her centrist opponent and a strong favorite. Polls show Mr. Macron drawing about 60 percent of the vote. The plagiarism accusations first came to light Monday evening after the French news media noted that several sections of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s speech at a rally near Paris closely matched an address by Mr. Fillon on April 15, before the first round of the election. Mr. Fillon, who drew 20 percent of the votes in the first round of the election, only 1.3 percentage point less than Ms. Le Pen, did not qualify for the second round and has asked his supporters to vote for Mr. Macron in the second round. In his speech in April at Le Puy-en-Velay, a small town in central France, Mr. Fillon referred to France\u2019s land and maritime borders, and praised its language and culture, in terms  similar to those Ms. Le Pen used on Monday. Ms. Le Pen also used quotes by the early-20th-century French statesman Georges Clemenceau and by Andr\u00e9 Malraux, a writer who served as culture minister in the late 1950s and \u201960s, that Mr. Fillon had used in his April 15 speech. Asked about the accusations that she had lifted parts of Mr. Fillon\u2019s speech, Louis Aliot, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s partner and a vice president of her National Front party, told the LCI news channel Tuesday morning that it was a \u201cclin d\u2019\u0153il\u201d \u2014 meaning a \u201cwink\u201d or a \u201cnod \u201d \u2014 addressed to Mr. Fillon\u2019s voters. \u201cWith part of the right, we have the exact same view on the nation\u2019s identity and on national independence,\u201d he added. Nicolas Bay, the party\u2019s secretary general, told the Public S\u00e9nat news channel on Tuesday that the speech had made a \u201csmall loan.\u201d \u201cIt shows that Marine Le Pen is not sectarian, and that when one of her opponents, in this case from the first round, speaks well about France, she can borrow his comments,\u201d Mr. Bay said. On Twitter, Paul-Marie Co\u00fbteaux, a French writer and editor, provided a possible explanation for the similarities between the two speeches: the words were his, pulled from a book published in 1997. \u201cIt is good (and significant) that Marine Le Pen and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, expressing themselves on France\u2019s universal calling, do so with the same terms,\u201d wrote Mr. Co\u00fbteaux, who founded but no longer presides over a small far-right organization close to the National Front called Sovereignty, Identity and Liberties. \u201cThese terms, of a Gaullist inspiration, are those of my work \u2018Europe\u2019s Road to War,\u2019 \u201d he said, referring to the heritage of former President Charles de Gaulle, and adding the hashtag #clindoeil. Speaking to the Journal du Dimanche newspaper on Tuesday, Mr. Co\u00fbteaux confirmed that he had provided notes to Mr. Fillon for his speech on April 15, but denied having done so for Ms. Le Pen. Still, he told the newspaper that he supported Ms. Le Pen and was not \u201cdispleased\u201d that the two candidates had used his words. What Fillon said: \u201cThis near perfect hexagon, a wonder of balance; three maritime coastlines: the English Channel and the North Sea, open on the Anglo-Saxon world and on the northern vastness, the Atlantic coastline, which for centuries has given us the open seas, and which hands us its adventures; the Mediterranean coastline, home to some of history\u2019s oldest and richest human civilizations.\u201d What Le Pen said: The candidate referred to France\u2019s \u201cthree maritime coastlines,\u201d citing \u201cthe English Channel and the North Sea, which links us to the Anglo-Saxon world, and the northern vastness; the Atlantic coastline, which gives us the open seas and speaks to us of adventure; the Mediterranean coastline, home to some of history\u2019s oldest and richest human civilizations.\u201d What Fillon said: France \u201cis a history, is a geography, but it is also a set of values and principles passed down from generation to generation, like passwords.\u201d What Le Pen said: \u201cBut France is also a set of values and principles passed down from generation to generation, like passwords.\u201d What Fillon said: \u201cIf one learns our language, sometimes at great expense, in Argentina or in Poland; if there are waiting lists to sign up for the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise in Shanghai, in Tokyo, in Mexico or for the French high schools in Rabat or in Rome; if Paris is the first tourism destination in the world; it is because France is something else, and much more, than an industrial, agricultural or military power.\u201d What Le Pen said: \u201cIf one learns our language, sometimes at great expense, in Argentina or in Poland; if there are waiting lists to sign up for the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise in Shanghai, in Tokyo, in Mexico or for the French high schools in Rabat or in Rome; if Paris is the first tourism destination in the world; it is because France is something else, and much more, than the industrial, agricultural or military power that it can and must become again.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/europe/france-election-le-pen-fillon-plagiarism.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T09:02:48-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T09:02:48-04:00", "abstract": "Supporters of the National Front contender, who used words very similar to those of her conservative former opponent Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, said they amounted to a \u201csmall loan.\u201d", "title": "Marine Le Pen, French Presidential Candidate, Is Accused of Plagiarism"}
