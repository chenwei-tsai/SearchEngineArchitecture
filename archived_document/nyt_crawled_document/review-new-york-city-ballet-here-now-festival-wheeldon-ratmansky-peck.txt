{"text": "By the numbers alone, New York City Ballet\u2019s Here/Now Festival is mind-blowing. Over the course of four weeks, the company is dancing 43 ballets by 22 choreographers. Even if that accounts for less than a quarter of the 230 works that more than 60 choreographers have made for the troupe since the death of its godlike founding choreographer, George Balanchine, in 1983, it\u2019s still an epic-size sample. No other ballet company in the world can approach these numbers. But it isn\u2019t just scale. The numbers tell a story. Only eight works from the 1980s and \u201990s are being revived, in effect conceding that that era was, as it is now generally remembered, a gloomy mourning period of anxiety, short on pathbreaking inspiration. Five of those eight are by Peter Martins, who has led City Ballet since Balanchine\u2019s death, and who, despite considerable skill, didn\u2019t turn out to be his equal as a genius choreographer. In the 35 works from the current century, there\u2019s another imbalance. Nineteen are by just three choreographers: Christopher Wheeldon, Alexei Ratmansky and Justin Peck. The first three programs of the festival have focused exclusively on their contributions: one man at a time, in the single-choreographer format that the company usually reserves for Balanchine or Jerome Robbins. Watched in order, the programs tell the story of the last 17 years as a tale of heroes, both homebred and from afar \u2014 a string of saviors and would-be successors. Mr. Wheeldon\u2019s program immediately shows you why he was once the company\u2019s great young hope. Created in 2000, when the British-born Mr. Wheeldon was 27, his \u201cMercurial Manoeuvres\u201d is a young person\u2019s \u201clook at everything I can do\u201d dance. With meshing geometries of large and mobile groups, a firebrand soloist and a poignant duet \u2014 all in a classical vocabulary that\u2019s been sped up and inventively extended without being slurred \u2014 it is choreography that follows the house tradition of closely attending to music. The work checks all the right boxes and retains the excitement of discovery. After making it, Mr. Wheeldon, who had joined City Ballet in 1993, retired from dancing to focus on choreography. Mr. Martins shrewdly created for him the post of artist in residence. And \u201cPolyphonia\u201d (2001), the next work on the all-Wheeldon program, demonstrates why that confidence was deserved. Set to piano pieces by Gyorgy Ligeti, it\u2019s obviously, allusively in the line of Balanchine\u2019s bracing modernist works \u201cAgon\u201d and \u201cEpisodes,\u201d yet it doesn\u2019t feel derivative. Alas, the rest of the Wheeldon program doesn\u2019t keep rising. Already in \u201cLiturgy,\u201d from 2003, there are signs of a rut, of a narrowing into one avenue of success (the elastic, extremely acrobatic pas de deux), and the jump to \u201cAmerican Rhapsody,\u201d choreographed last year, is a large falling-off. The ingenuity is still there, and the craft, but smothered in hokeyness, settling for something rote. Mr. Wheeldon did make work for City Ballet between 2003 and 2016. Two more pieces \u2014 including his biggest hit, the 2005 \u201cAfter the Rain Pas de Deux\u201d \u2014 are scattered among the highly uneven offerings of the seven remaining Here/Now programs. But the gap does imply a break, the moment in 2008 when Mr. Wheeldon resigned to concentrate on his own, ill-fated company, Morphoses. By that time, there was competition, for in 2006, Alexei Ratmansky, then the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, had made \u201cRussian Seasons.\u201d Here was a surprise: a work dense with classical steps, steeped in ballet history, as musically responsive as any lover of Balanchine could wish, but full of character and feeling and suggested stories about love and marriage and death. Its humor is distinctive, not always flattering to human nature. It feels wise. Joining it on the all-Ratmansky bill is \u201cNamouna\u201d (2010), just as wonderful. Though it, too, is rooted in ballet history, it is not quite like anything else: a screwball comedy that\u2019s also a hallucinatory dream. Between the two Ratmansky works is a missed connection, a path not taken. After \u201cRussian Seasons,\u201d it was widely assumed that Mr. Ratmansky would become resident choreographer for City Ballet. But in 2009, he shocked everyone by joining American Ballet Theater instead. He has since made two works for City Ballet \u2014 both, strange and original and marvelous, are highlights of later Here/Now programs \u2014 and he unveils a premiere at next week\u2019s gala, but his departure left an opening. Mr. Peck filled it. His program begins with \u201cIn Creases,\u201d the first piece he made for the company, in 2012, when he was a 25-year-old member of the corps de ballet. It introduced his precocious command of craft and composition and his uncommon imagination. It\u2019s unformulaic and kaleidoscopic, with intricate groupings that grow and change like life-forms and a guileless enthusiasm for invention and exploration. No wonder Mr. Martins gave Mr. Peck the resident choreographer job in 2014. Firmly based in classical technique and Balanchinian musicality, Mr. Peck\u2019s choreography seems of the moment, colored by contemporary manners. It\u2019s egalitarian, flattening ballet\u2019s traditional hierarchies, with principal dancers often costumed the same as everyone else. A relay chain of duets in the middle of \u201cNew Blood\u201d (2015) treats men dancing with men and women dancing with women no differently from men and women dancing together. The pas de deux, as a vehicle of emotion, hasn\u2019t been Mr. Peck\u2019s strength, and yet \u201cThe Dreamers,\u201d a 2016 pas de deux on the program, is a fascinating examination of ballet conventions, a novel drama. I find the large-scale \u201cEverywhere We Go\u201d (2014) impeded by its Sufjan Stevens score, but the invention doesn\u2019t cease. Mr. Peck is an astonishing talent, better represented later in Here/Now by \u201cYear of the Rabbit\u201d (2012) and \u201cRodeo: Four Dance Episodes\u201d (2014). (There\u2019s also a Peck premiere buried in the otherwise dreary-looking Program 8.) And that\u2019s where City Ballet is today. Except there\u2019s one more story remaining in the numbers: the high percentage of very recent works by many different choreographers. Logistics are surely behind this choice \u2014 these pieces are fresh in the dancers\u2019 memories \u2014 but it\u2019s also a display of fresh life, signs of a promising generation. Maybe there\u2019s a sense now that after Mr. Wheeldon and Mr. Ratmansky unquestionably enriched the repertory without ascending to divinity, that no one, not even the prolific Mr. Peck, needs to fill the Balanchine role alone.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/dance/review-new-york-city-ballet-here-now-festival-wheeldon-ratmansky-peck.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T16:34:58-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T16:34:58-04:00", "abstract": "The company\u2019s Here/Now Festival begins with programs focusing on the work of Christopher Wheeldon, Alexei Ratmansky and Justin Peck.", "title": "New York City Ballet: A Story in Three Choreographers"}
