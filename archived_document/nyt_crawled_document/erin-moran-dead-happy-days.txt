She was 56. The Harrison County Sheriff\u2019s Department in southern Indiana confirmed her death. She was found unresponsive on Saturday afternoon, and the authorities said an autopsy was pending. Ms. Moran started acting as a child at 5, and got her first taste of television in a commercial for First Federal Bank. She went on to play minor characters in television and film in the late 1960s and early \u201970s. At age 12, she landed her biggest role: Joanie, the freckle-faced troublemaker and sister of Richie Cunningham, the all-American teenager played by Ron Howard. Over the 10-year run of \u201cHappy Days,\u201d Joanie transformed from the young teenager who complained about being sent to her room to a major character on the show. In later seasons, Joanie\u2019s love interest with the aspiring musician Chachi Arcola became a major story line. In 1982, the two characters were given their own show, \u201cJoanie Loves Chachi,\u201d a widely panned comedy that followed their romantic adventures and musical pursuits in Chicago. While \u201cHappy Days\u201d was a No. 1 hit, the spinoff with Ms. Moran and Scott Baio, who played Chachi, lasted only 17 episodes. The end of the show also ushered in a swift downfall for Ms. Moran\u2019s acting career and her opportunities in Hollywood. She was only 22 when the show ended, but despite minor appearances on other shows, she never held another leading role.", "title": "Erin Moran, Who Played Joanie on \u2018Happy Days,\u2019 Dies at 56", "item_type": "Article", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/arts/television/erin-moran-dead-happy-days.html"}
