As I stood there, a woman got out of her car and marched indignantly up to one of the sanitation workers to complain that she needed to be somewhere soon. Before the man could reply, a rat jumped through a hole in the bag he was holding and ran up his arm, perching momentarily on his shoulder while considering its next move. With a visible shiver of fear and loathing, he smacked the rat off his shoulder. Turning to the woman, who stood with mouth agape, he said, \u201cLady, you see what we gotta contend with here.\u201d Chastened, she spun around without uttering a word and returned to her car, where she waited for the truck to finish its stop.", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
