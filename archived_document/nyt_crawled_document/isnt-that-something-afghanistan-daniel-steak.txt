{"text": "THURSDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Everyone loves a bargain, and today Todd Gross returns to offer us two games for the price of one. You\u2019ll be able to solve the puzzle whether you are solving in print or online, but if you\u2019re solving in print, you\u2019ll see an additional grid in the center that might remind you of another type of puzzle that some people love to solve. If you are solving online, you will see a 4x4 grouping of circled squares. Imagine that there are thicker lines dividing that 4x4 grid into four 2x2 grids. Mr. Gross has placed a Sudoku grid in the center of his crossword that can be solved by filling in the crossword entries. I was struck by the fact that he could successfully fill that centered grid with letters used only once both down and across, just like in a Sudoku puzzle. He has also managed to salt his larger grid with additional theme material, including the hint at 1A/68A that we should focus on the CENTRAL SQUARES and, if we are still lost, he spills the beans at 8A/67A that we are about to solve a SUDOKU PUZZLE. The T, E, R and A inside the Sudoku grid are common letters, so it\u2019s not a high-wire act, but it\u2019s a neat trick that Mr. Gross pulls off well. One thing I really liked about this was that it felt like a 14x16, daily-size tip of the hat to Liz Gorski\u2019s magic square puzzle and her checkerboard puzzle. If you\u2019ve never solved a Sudoku logic puzzle, I highly recommend them. You can solve them for free on The New York Times puzzle page. \u25a0 22A: Wordplay alert! Watch those question marks. Today\u2019s \u201cReed section?\u201d is not part of an orchestra, it\u2019s a MARSH. \u25a0 55A: We need to note the occasion of a clue for ONO that isn\u2019t about the singer Yoko ONO. As far as I can tell, it\u2019s happened once before in 2014, but I empathize with the editors, I really do. Imagine how it feels to see ONO \u2014 a perfectly cromulent entry, but very common \u2014 for what feels like the millionth time, and having such slim pickings when it comes to cluing choices. I would have gone with the mackerel, too. \u25a0 61A: Tough one. \u201cTops off?\u201d is a HAIRCUT today. \u25a0 15D: Thank goodness for the parenthetical \u201cneighbor of Page Up\u201d in the clue. I work on a Mac and don\u2019t have a NUM Lock key that I\u2019m aware of. I wouldn\u2019t even know what to do with it, except maybe ... lock numbers? But the \u201cPage Up\u201d hint told me that it was a keyboard key and I was able to consult the PC users in my household.
