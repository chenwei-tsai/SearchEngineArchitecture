We should also remember that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s leader, set up a government commission on the fate of the dam just before her trip to Beijing last year, presumably so that she would not have to deal with the Chinese on this thorny issue on her first visit as state counselor. Now she must decide, and there are no good options for her. Her acclaim has diminished internally because of limited progress on reforms, and internationally because she has not spoken out on human rights issues related to the Rohingya and Muslims. She has said her highest priority is the peace process \u2014 ending decades of various insurgencies among ethnic groups \u2014 but approving this or more dams in their areas further jeopardizes her government\u2019s credibility. Any decision she makes will antagonize important political elements. DAVID I. STEINBERG, BETHESDA, MD.
