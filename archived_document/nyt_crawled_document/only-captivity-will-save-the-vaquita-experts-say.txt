{"text": "TIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 It was not the first time Robert L. Brownell Jr. had seen a dead vaquita, the rare and endangered porpoise that was lying on the stainless-steel necropsy table inside the Tijuana Zoo on Monday. But it might well be one of the last. Mr. Brownell, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, had in effect discovered the porpoise, finding the first full, dead specimen in 1966. The world\u2019s smallest member of the cetacean grouping, which includes whales and dolphins, the vaquita was the most recent cetacean to be recognized by modern science. Now it may well become the latest to go extinct. A high-level, bilateral panel of Mexican and American scientists met this week and is expected to announce that it believes efforts to save the animal have, essentially, failed. That announcement would mean that the only hope for the vaquita\u2019s recovery would be to capture the surviving animals, if any can be found. Some of the scientists involved think the surviving vaquitas now number as few as two or three, and the latest two vaquitas found dead could even be the last ones \u2014 though it could take years to confirm that. The vaquita has been described, by some of the few people who have seen one of the elusive porpoises alive, as the smiley-faced sea panda because of the dark outlines around its mouth and the black circles around its eyes. Its plight has drawn in celebrities like Miley Cyrus and Leonardo DiCaprio, and spurred cooperation among scientists and environmentalists, north and south of the border, in and out of government. But the push has been imperiled by traffickers in the body parts of endangered species, unscrupulous fishermen and uneven enforcement efforts. The problem can be traced to Chinese demand for a rare swim bladder from the endangered totoaba fish, which shares the vaquita\u2019s range, in the northern tip of the Gulf of California. According to Mexican scientists, that demand has grown so much that prices for the bladders, used for a homeopathic remedy, rival the wholesale price of cocaine \u2014 as much as $10,000 per kilogram. Mexican officials and those from the Mexican-American panel, the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita, say Mexican drug cartels have been attracted to the trade by the high profits, and by the assurance that no fisherman has ever gone to jail for trafficking in swim bladders. The nets used to catch the totoaba have trapped the much less numerous vaquita as well, to devastating effect. The Mexican government has banned the nets and even paid some fishermen not to fish in the vaquita\u2019s range, but those efforts have not helped. The results on the necropsy table at the Tijuana Zoo were only too evident. A 1-year-old female, a little over three feet long \u2014 full-grown vaquitas are nearly five feet \u2014 the porpoise had the imprint of the net in which she died stamped in six-inch squares on the grayish skin on her left side. On her right side, the skin was flayed off, probably as the porpoise struggled while drowning in the net. The specimen was labeled PS7, because it was the seventh vaquita (scientific name: Phocoena sinus) to be found dead since a survey last summer, which determined that only 30 vaquita remained at the time. Then on Tuesday, PS8 was found by a NOAA scientist, washed up on a beach at the northern end of the Gulf. Scientists say there are likely to be many more undiscovered dead ones. Budget cuts from the Trump administration may add to the vaquita\u2019s woes. Both Mr. Brownell and the scientist performing the autopsy, Frances Gulland, a veterinarian from Sausalito, Calif., who is also director of the federal Marine Mammal Commission, now work for offices with zero budgets proposed for the coming year. Not since the Yangtze River dolphin went extinct in 2006 in China has a cetacean gone over the brink. \u201cWe always thought that what happened in China would not happen here,\u201d Dr. Gulland said. \u201cWe have the U.S. government\u2019s prize laboratory and it\u2019s on their doorstep. We have all these experts and scientists \u2014 we have everything. We thought, This won\u2019t happen, we can fix this problem.\u201d She was referring to NOAA\u2019s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, a San Diego community just a short day trip from the northern Gulf of California. \u201cIt has taken on a huge symbolic importance.\u201d Alarmed about the new vaquita deaths, her commission paid to put out acoustic listening devices on a limited scale in February, focusing on where vaquitas were last found in 2016. The devices pick up the animals\u2019 echolocating clicks, a form of sonar they use to navigate and communicate. By analyzing the number and frequency of the clicks, compared with previous years, scientists can calculate the number of animals in their fairly limited range. In February two or three animals were believed to still be active, Dr. Gulland said. Since then four more vaquitas have been found dead, two in March and the two this week, one of which was recovered by a monitoring vessel from the Sea Shepherd environmental group. Capt. Oona Layolle, who runs the group\u2019s vaquita campaign, said their ships had recovered 183 totoaba nets just since December. She disagrees, though, with the vaquita panel\u2019s proposals. \u201cI don\u2019t think by putting an animal in a cage you are saving it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was another dead vaquita found yesterday,\u201d said Barbara Taylor, a marine conservation biologist at the science center, and a member of the vaquita recovery committee, on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re all very depressed about that. The committee meeting will be making very clear that any vaquita that\u2019s basically not taken out of its dangerous habitat is probably going to die.\u201d The extinction of the vaquita is a sensitive political issue in Mexico, where President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has made it an issue of pride that his country could save the animal. \u201cThe president has said that even if there is only one vaquita left, we will do everything we can,\u201d said Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, a scientist who is in charge of the vaquita effort for the Mexican environment ministry. The porpoise\u2019s decline has been increasing exponentially, even as protection efforts have ramped up. In 1997, scientists counted 567 vaquitas; the number dropped by half in the next nine years, to 245. In just one year, the number halved again, to only 30 last year from 60 in 2015. The vaquita may go extinct without mankind ever having gotten to fully know it. No live specimen has ever been taken. Because vaquitas are small and travel singly or in pairs rather than in big pods, following and observing their behavior is difficult. Tragically for conservation efforts, a female takes two years to produce a single calf, and two years to reach sexual maturity, so replacing each lost animal takes years. Already, vaquitas are so inbred that genetically, as Ms. Taylor said, \u201cthey basically all have the same last name.\u201d If the vaquita becomes extinct, Dr. Gulland said, it will have the distinction of being wiped out entirely through human action, even while humans were trying desperately to save it. \u201cThis is direct, human-caused extinction,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s one lesson learned, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t manage humans.\u201d Mr. Brownell said this might be one battle the fishermen had won. \u201cThe fishermen just think, \u2018Oh, good, if we can get rid of the last one, then we can get on and keep fishing.\u2019\u201d If that hasn\u2019t already happened, many scientists now believe, it may soon.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/americas/only-captivity-will-save-the-vaquita-experts-say.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T15:32:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T15:32:54-04:00", "abstract": "Scientists say that efforts to save the small porpoise in the Gulf of California have essentially failed, and some believe there may be only two or three left.", "title": "Only Captivity Will Save the Vaquita, Experts Say"}
