{"text": "Two centuries of his country\u2019s rhythms flow through the fingers of Jo\u00e3o Bosco, one of Brazil\u2019s most fabled guitarists, singers and composers. Now 70, he can stir up a whirlwind of speed and agility, breezing through tricky meters, harmonies and beats from all over Brazil. \u201cJo\u00e3o sounds like an orchestra,\u201d said the jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour. \u201cHe\u2019s got several things going on at the same time. He can be playing a very complex rhythm on the guitar, and at the same time he\u2019s singing something completely different.\u201d His virtuosity has made Mr. Bosco a draw in places where Portuguese is not spoken; from Tuesday through Saturday he will display it at Birdland in a rare New York engagement. But back home, his significance is much deeper. In the 1970s and early \u201980s, when Brazilians lived under a harsh military dictatorship, he and his lyricist, Aldir Blanc, empowered them with songs that conveyed intense pride and fighting spirit. The messages were often encoded to fool the censors; Mr. Bosco\u2019s lilting tunes and rhythms made every song seem to float. One of the duo\u2019s hit sambas, \u201cNa\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d (\u201cNation\u201d), lives on as an anthem of Brazil\u2019s majesty; it recalls folkloric heroes, the glories of nature, the deities (orix\u00e1s) who watch over things, and battles won. Beneath it all is his playing, with its rock-steady forward momentum. Stories about Mr. Bosco\u2019s career tumbled out of him as he talked by phone recently from his home in Rio de Janeiro. For all the ease of his playing and singing, he practices relentlessly, he said. \u201cI never studied music formally,\u201d Mr. Bosco explained. \u201cEverything came from my intuitive perception.\u201d During the late \u201960s, he was an engineering student in his home state of Minas Gerais; away from school he experimented with guitar. Mr. Bosco was entranced by Dorival Caymmi, the father of 20th-century Brazilian songwriting, who composed, played guitar and sang as though one were inseparable from the other. Meanwhile, he absorbed every rhythm he heard, from the tribal Afro-Brazilian sounds that played on the radio to the airy pulse of bossa nova. As American jazz trickled into Brazil, Mr. Bosco discovered the time-bending meters of the pianist Dave Brubeck. In 1970, he met Mr. Blanc, a psychiatry student and sometime lyricist. They began writing together, while still pursuing their professions. After two years, Mr. Bosco heard one of their songs on the radio as sung by a ferocious young star, Elis Regina, who would become his muse. \u201cI had always dreamed of living in Rio,\u201d he said; that moment compelled him to move there and take up music full-time. He and Mr. Blanc joined a vanguard of young, brainy, socially committed musicians and songwriters who emerged in the heat of the dictatorship: Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and others. Whatever they wrote, the censors had to approve. \u201cThey had no criteria for censorship \u2014 just some abstract rules,\u201d Mr. Bosco said; one had to keep rewriting and resubmitting, driven by \u201cthat very strong will to put your idea into words.\u201d He added, \u201cSometimes it took you to an even higher level of creativity.\u201d Often, he added, \u201cthe censors lost and the song won.\u201d Four decades after the creation of \u201cO B\u00eabado e a Equilibrista\u201d (\u201cThe Drunk and the Tightrope Walker\u201d), Brazilian audiences still sing along with this masterwork by Mr. Blanc and Mr. Bosco. The song\u2019s beginnings can be traced to Christmas 1977, when Mr. Bosco heard that Charlie Chaplin had died and thought of writing a Carnaval samba in his honor. He brought the idea to Mr. Blanc, and their imaginations flew. Recalling Chaplin\u2019s portrayal of an aging, drunken clown in the movie \u201cLimelight,\u201d they spun that image into an allegory of the political circus Brazil had become; between the lines was a call to let those in exile come home. Ms. Regina performed it \u201cin a manner so soul-stirring and magisterial,\u201d Mr. Bosco said, that audiences knew what the song meant, even if the censors didn\u2019t. The drive to help a troubled country has never left him. A few years ago he began writing songs with his son, Francisco Bosco, a poet, journalist and philosopher. \u201cMalabaristas do Sinal Vermelho\u201d (\u201cRed-Light Jugglers\u201d) speaks of children who descend from the hillside slums and accost drivers stopped at a red light. The youngsters juggle for tips; but under the influence of drugs, some rob or kill. The words take a compassionate view of Brazil\u2019s social outcasts, some of whom may \u201cclaim their share\u201d while others \u201cpay with their lives.\u201d Mr. Bosco deepened the pathos by inviting a choir of children from Rosinha, one of Rio\u2019s most treacherous favelas, to sing with him on the record. He is old enough now to be their grandfather, but his fingers still fly with the same dexterity. Recently, he said, \u201cI went to a religious space in Salvador, Bahia, and in front of the orix\u00e1s I told myself that if ever I cannot deliver the music in a way that meets my standards, I would rather become mute.\u201d He spoke again of his reverence for musical practice. \u201cI study; I concentrate; I give up a lot of things to be able to present music the way it should be presented,\u201d he said. \u201cMusic is everything to me. I am alive because I\u2019m singing and playing.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/music/joao-bosco-birdland-interview.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T17:39:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T17:39:54-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Bosco, who practices relentlessly, helped empower Brazilians living under dictatorship in the 1970s and early \u201980s with songs of pride and fighting spirit.", "title": "Passion and Politics in Jo\u00e3o Bosco\u2019s Brazilian Rhythms"}
