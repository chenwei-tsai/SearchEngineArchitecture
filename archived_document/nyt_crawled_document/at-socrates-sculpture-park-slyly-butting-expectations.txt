{"text": "A flamboyant herd of concrete goats seem to strut their stuff across Socrates Sculpture Park on the waterfront in Long Island City, Queens. Part of the exhibition \u201cNari Ward: G.O.A.T., again,\u201d each goat has a shaft of rebar shooting up from its back that\u2019s embellished with materials. Some are adorned with dazzling gold leaf or an extravagant pompadour of hairy black palm. The one Mr. Ward calls \u201cthe social media goat\u201d sprouts a tangle of electric cords and has a body tinted red, white and blue. Another, tarred and feathered, stands alone. The goat can be a loaded symbol, according to Mr. Ward, 53, who was born in Jamaica and now lives in Harlem with his wife and two children. He likes to elicit association, memory, history and politics through installations and large-scale sculptures laden with commonplace and often-discarded objects that he collects from the streets. At his studio and home in a former fire station, he described how the goat can be perceived as a sacrificial animal as well as an image of debauchery, as humble or arrogant, an insult or a boast. Musicians and athletes often use G.O.A.T. as an acronym for Greatest of All Time. After Donald J. Trump won the election, Mr. Ward thought the goat seemed like the suitable form for populating the public park. \u201cAudacity was in the air, with this ego running rampant,\u201d said Mr. Ward, a natural storyteller with an easy sense of humor. He had intended to do something \u201cabsurdist and ridiculous\u201d with chickens after being offered the Socrates commission last summer but scrapped that plan in November. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel playful anymore,\u201d he said, emphasizing that the idea is bigger than the new president. \u201cThere was something urgent that I needed to talk about. The title \u2018G.O.A.T., again\u2019 is referencing the small-minded concept of history that you\u2019re the Greatest of All Time.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s universal,\u201d he said, \u201cis the notion of a savior, the notion of a charlatan, the abuse of power and manipulation.\u201d Splayed across the center of the park is a 40-foot-long hobbyhorse with a colossal faux-stone goat\u2019s head. Titled \u201cScapegoat,\u201d a term that goes back to the Bible, the sculpture is like a caricature of a political monument or the abandoned plaything of a deity. Mr. Ward imagines the outsize animal as part of a play \u201cwhere the main character is killed.\u201d Whether \u201cScapegoat\u201d is meant to be worshiped, ostracized or mourned is left ambiguous. \u201cIt\u2019s up the viewer to figure out their role in that,\u201d said Mr. Ward, who likes to keep his imagery open-ended enough to invite multiple readings. \u201cThe goats become the ambassadors for the conversation,\u201d he added. Indeed, Mr. Ward seems to be courting public opinion in the park with a giant glowing sign that spells \u201cApollo,\u201d like the Harlem theater. But in Mr. Ward\u2019s version, the first and last letters blink to flip the message to \u201cpoll,\u201d a word linked to the 2016 election. \u201cIt\u2019s the linchpin of the show,\u201d said Mr. Ward, connecting the theater\u2019s Amateur Night, where the crowd cheers contestants or boos them off the stage, with the protests, rallies and social media eruptions across the American landscape. \u201cG.O.A.T., again\u201d marks the first time a single artist has taken on the entire five-acre park. The executive director of Socrates Sculpture Park, John Hatfield, felt Mr. Ward was the right artist for the challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s a rarity to have an artist immersively occupy an outdoor space with works that can amplify one another,\u201d Mr. Hatfield said. \u201cNari often combines two aspects masterfully \u2014 a darkness that leads you into a critique of the social strata with the joyousness of a toy or celebratory aspect of scale \u2014 and then lets people create their own stories.\u201d For Mr. Ward, who just had a midcareer traveling museum survey open at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, working outside the white cube of the gallery is a return to how he started. In 1993, during a residency at the Studio Museum in Harlem after receiving his master of fine arts degree at Brooklyn College, he began collecting abandoned baby strollers from the streets. They were a poignant symbol to him of disrupted lives. Staging his own exhibition in a rented fire station (where he moved in 1999), he clustered 365 strollers and carved out an ellipse-shaped pathway lined with fire hose. The installation suggested both a vulva and a ship\u2019s hull. Titled \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d \u2014 a song that permeated the space in a haunting loop \u2014 it evoked journeys both painful and transcendent and helped develop Mr. Ward\u2019s approach to assembling found objects rich with past lives and stories. Cecilia Alemani, who commissioned Mr. Ward\u2019s \u201cSmart Tree\u201d for the High Line last year, called Mr. Ward \u201ca poet of urban transformation.\u201d \u201cNari\u2019s able to chronicle the life of the city and the people who live in the cities through the objects that they use and leave behind,\u201d she said. He stopped traffic on the High Line with his sculpture of a car propped on cinder blocks and covered with a patchwork of cut tires that became a giant vase for an apple tree. It was based on a childhood memory of his father buying a broken car that he intended to fix but left sitting so long in his yard in Jamaica that it sprouted a tree. \u201cThere was quite an element of hope,\u201d Ms. Alemani said. This year Mr. Ward won the $100,000 Vilcek Prize, awarded annually to an immigrant artist who has contributed significantly to American culture. He came from Jamaica at 12 with his family, first to Brooklyn and then Parsippany, N.J. There, his mother worked as a housekeeper for Fred Schwartz \u2014 famous locally for his \u201cFred the Furrier\u201d TV ads in the 1970s \u2014 and the family lived with Mr. Schwartz\u2019s mentally handicapped brother-in-law. \u201cIt became my job to take care of Howie,\u201d Mr. Ward said. \u201cI felt this weird sense of protection for him. It was my tour of duty.\u201d The works in Mr. Ward\u2019s museum survey, which opened in 2015 at the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami and also traveled to the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, explore clich\u00e9s of Caribbean culture, the simultaneous visibility and invisibility of black men on city streets, and ideas of migration, struggle and ascension. Ruth Erickson, associate curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, who coordinated the presentation there, said she \u201ccould not have imagined how newly timely Nari\u2019s survey would be in our current political moment.\u201d \u201cNaturalization Drawing Table\u201d from 2004 shows the procrastinatory doodles Mr. Ward made on an Immigration and Naturalization Service form the first time he set out to become a citizen. \u201cThe work I was making was questioning what it means to be an American, in response to post 9/11 fervor and distancing ourselves from other people,\u201d Mr. Ward said. \u201cI thought I needed to get my citizenship if I wanted to critique this country that I love.\u201d He finally completed the process in 2012 after multiple starts and stops. His drawing table will be activated on May 4, when visitors to the show can receive an edition set of Mr. Ward\u2019s elaborate doodles in return for filling out the I.N.S. form and having a passport photo taken on-site. The notarized applications will then be hung on the wall of the museum and become a permanent part of the piece. Participation is also weaved into a billboard-size installation in which thousands of shoelaces spell the first words of the Constitution, \u201cWe the People,\u201d originally conceived in 2011 using hand-dyed laces. Mr. Ward was persuaded by the philanthropist Diana DiMenna to make a new version this year as a permanent acquisition for the New-York Historical Society after landing on the idea of collecting used shoelaces from among the 200,000 schoolchildren who visit the society annually. \u201cWe wanted people, and especially children, to be able to put themselves literally into the narrative of what it means to be \u2018we the people\u2019,\u201d Ms. DiMenna said. On view in the lobby, \u201cWe the People\u201d has been integrated into the society\u2019s curriculum on constitutional history and is a pit stop for visiting school groups. This month a frequent visitor to Socrates Sculpture Park watched Mr. Ward installing \u201cBipartition Bell,\u201d a bulbous organic shape made of hammered copper dangling from a steel frame and reminiscent of the Liberty Bell. The man called out to Mr. Ward, asking him if it was testicles \u201cyou have hanging up there.\u201d The artist pretended not to hear, but then told the man it was an \u201cupside-down heart.\u201d Finally he sheepishly admitted it was indeed modeled on a goat scrotum. \u201cIt\u2019s this massive organ that\u2019s about virility and potentiality,\u201d said Mr. Ward, who will also have a gallery exhibition at Lehmann Maupin in June. While his sculpture seems to promise a resounding gong, viewers who duck their heads inside the bell will find only the tiniest billy goat chime that they can ring. Mr. Ward said he\u2019s playing with the idea of \u201cunfulfilled expectations,\u201d something he feels many Americans are currently experiencing. For black Americans, he said, it has long been \u201cthe norm.\u201d \u201cWhen what you want to happen doesn\u2019t happen, how do you then deal with the shortcomings?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think artists are good at shedding light on emotional spaces that are buried because they\u2019re painful to revisit.\u201d Yet he never wants to leave viewers without a silver lining. In Mr. Ward\u2019s goat-land, where testicles can be read as a heart, the little bell inside may be a letdown, or a seed of hope.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/design/at-socrates-sculpture-park-slyly-butting-expectations.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:34-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:34-04:00", "abstract": "Using a goat as a symbol in a sculpture installation, Nari Ward plays off the political notion of \u201cthe greatest.\u201d", "title": "At Socrates Sculpture Park, Slyly Butting Expectations"}
