{"text": "SATURDAY PUZZLE \u2014 If you\u2019re going to hunt for gimmes in a Saturday crossword \u2014 and you must, because that\u2019s the only way to gain that all-important foothold \u2014 you can\u2019t do much better than an entry that stretches right down the center of the grid. You can continue on in pretty much any direction from there, and it\u2019s a real confidence-booster to know that you\u2019ve conquered a big swath of the puzzle with just one entry. That\u2019s why I was so pleased to have MARILYN MONROE pop into my brain as soon as I read the clue \u201cFamed Pop Art subject.\u201d Andy Warhol\u2019s 1962 portrayal of the movie star has been much imitated, so that was easy enough even though CAMPBELL\u2019S SOUP fits in there too, not that I\u2019m bitter. That\u2019s Saturday for you. I also liked seeing the debuts of DEAD GIVEAWAY, DILLY DALLIES and SOUNDING BOARD. OWL\u2019S NEST also appears for the first time today, with the very clever clue \u201cHooter\u2019s location.\u201d \u25a0 17A: Great wordplay here. It\u2019s not a geographic \u201cFault line?\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a line uttered when accepting fault for something: MEA CULPA. \u25a0 18A: I love the word NATANT. The fact that it means \u201cSwimming or floating\u201d makes me want to connect it somehow to the word \u201cnatal\u201d because a fetus floats, but \u201cnatal\u201d is apparently derived from the Latin natalis, meaning \u201cpertaining to birth or origin.\u201d \u25a0 39A: If you\u2019re not sure how \u201cGo the right way?\u201d pertains to the word GEE, watch this: 1D: Nice play on the old phrase \u201cpin money,\u201d which was the term for the money given to women by their husbands to buy pins for sewing on the two days of the year that shops were allowed to sell them. In today\u2019s puzzle, \u201cPIN money?\u201d refers to the PIN you use at an A.T.M., and the answer is A.T.M. FEES. And DILLY DALLIES. I really liked that one.
