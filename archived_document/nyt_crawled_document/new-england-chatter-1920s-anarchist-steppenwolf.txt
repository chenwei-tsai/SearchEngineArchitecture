{"text": "SUNDAY PUZZLE \u2014 The title of today\u2019s puzzle gives away a lot of the theme of the puzzle, and what fascinated me about it was how our brains interpret that information. Your mileage may vary, of course, but it felt like today\u2019s theme was narrated in my head by the actor William Daniels as he portrayed the Massachusetts native John Adams in the film \u201c1776.\u201d That\u2019s not a bad thing at all, unless the song \u201cSit Down, John!\u201d gets irretrievably stuck in your head. It\u2019s just an observation that doing a crossword puzzle can bring up a lot of things for people, and 1970s musicals might be one of them. Alan Arbesfeld returns today with a theme set that changes the sound in familiar phrases to different phrases that sound as if someone in New England might say them, and then they are clued in a punny way. For example, at 22A, the phrase \u201cspark plugs\u201d is restated as SPOCK PLUGS, which is roughly how it might sound coming from a New Englander. It\u2019s then clued as \u201cCommercials for a \u2018Star Trek\u2019 movie?\u201d Similarly, at 36A, the \u201cheart specialist\u201d becomes a HOT SPECIALIST, or a \u201cWeather forecaster in Phoenix?\u201d Most of these work well, although changing \u201cA Call to Arms\u201d to A CALL TO OMS falters a bit in my opinion because OMS is typically pronounced with a long O. I liked A SHOT IN THE DOC at 100A, but felt that the double \u201cah\u201d sound was a bit distracting. I did like INSTANT COMMA, LOW COB DIET and IT\u2019S MY POTTY as well. \u25a0 1A: Please tell me you got this one. \u201cPart of a crossword\u201d is the GRID. \u25a0 27A: The Latin phrase ET ALII means \u201cand others,\u201d so it would shorten a roster by quite a bit if used. \u25a0 33A: Vocabulary challenge! A RACEME is a cluster of flowers on a shoot or stem. \u25a0 43A: Remember the \u201ctail\u201d or \u201cend\u201d trick. The clue \u201cSerpent\u2019s tail\u201d is asking you for a suffix for \u201cserpent,\u201d which in this case would be INE, as in \u201cserpentine.\u201d \u25a0 108A: Study up on your \u201cTwo-time U.S. Open champ\u201d Ernie ELS with this print-and-save study sheet on famous sports figures who appear frequently in crosswords. \u25a0 5D: Not the home videos, sadly. The \u201cHigh points of a European vacation\u201d are the ALPS. \u25a0 11D: We only have four squares, so I knew this wouldn\u2019t be Caroline Kennedy. LUCI Baines Johnson is the daughter of President Lyndon Johnson and his wife, Claudia Alta \u201cLady Bird\u201d Johnson. Yes, kids, we once called the wife of a president \u201cLady Bird.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure that was the last time we got away with it. \u25a0 21D: Wordplay alert! \u201cHeads for the bar?\u201d sounds what we would like to do after a long day, but in this case, it refers to the heads found on drinks inside the bar, and the answer is FOAMS. \u25a0 56D: Remember the old \u201cWe\u2019re really talking about the letters in the word\u201d trick. \u201cBuffet centerpiece?\u201d is too vague to be an actual food dish, so focus on the word \u201cbuffet\u201d itself: What\u2019s at the center? The two EFS, of course. \u25a0 120D: \u201cSpring for a vacation?\u201d sounds like an action, doesn\u2019t it? Read it again. What other kinds of \u201cspring\u201d do you know? Today, it\u2019s a natural spring, and it\u2019s located at a SPA.
