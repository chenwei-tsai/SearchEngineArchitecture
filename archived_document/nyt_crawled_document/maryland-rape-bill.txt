{"updated_date": "2017-04-19T11:14:14-04:00", "text": "To supporters of a Maryland bill to help rape victims, the idea seemed like a no-brainer: Women impregnated by their attackers should not have to fight custody battles to raise their children or, as often happens, put them up for adoption. The proposal had the support of lawmakers in both parties and people on both sides of the abortion debate. Bills had passed unanimously in both the State Senate and the House of Delegates. The governor was on board. But on the last day of the annual three-month session last week, the legislation died at the stroke of midnight. Now, unless Maryland lawmakers bring up the bill in a special session, which seems unlikely, the state will remain one of a handful without such a law. It came down to six legislators who handled last-minute negotiations on April 10. Critics were quick to note that all of the negotiators were men. \u201cIt\u2019s bad optics,\u201d said Kathleen Dumais, a Democratic member of the House of Delegates who sponsored the House bill. \u201cI think it\u2019s insensitive. But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the reason that it failed.\u201d Ms. Dumais said the failure was mainly a testament to the complications that can plague policy-making in the part-time legislature. But she wondered if some legislators were content to let the clock\u2019s hands deliver the fatal blow. Ms. Dumais said her bill was motivated by a few \u201chorrible\u201d custody fights and would have affected no more than 10 cases per year. \u201cIn general there\u2019s this sort of perception that it would be misused,\u201d she said, \u201cthat women would lie and say they\u2019d been raped in order to avoid letting a father have access or custody.\u201d The proposal had support from state legislators on both sides of the aisle and, in a rare feat, was backed by both the Maryland Catholic Conference and Planned Parenthood of Maryland. Anti-abortion groups thought the legislation would make it easier for women to choose adoption, while other groups said it would protect rape victims. The goal was to give rape victims a way to deny custody to fathers in civil court, because the vast majority of rapes do not result in criminal convictions. The disagreements came down to how best to protect the rights of men not convicted of crimes. Senator Bobby A. Zirkin, a Democrat who is chairman of the Senate\u2019s judicial proceedings committee, noted that both bills proposed using private family courts \u2014 not criminal courts \u2014 to deny parental rights to those accused of rape. \u201cThis would be the first time I\u2019d be aware of where we\u2019d be proving a crime in a civil procedure,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should be walked into carefully.\u201d He said the Senate\u2019s version ensured that any statements made in civil court could not be used in a criminal trial, in order to prevent self-incrimination. Lisae C. Jordan, executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which has spent years advocating for this law, said there was no reason the negotiations had to wait until hours before the deadline. \u201cI don\u2019t buy it.\u201d She also said the objections were overblown, adding that the House bill had more protections than any such bill in the country. For example, it required \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence against a parent accused of rape, a higher standard than many other civil cases. But supporters eventually gave in on most issues in order to pass something \u2014 anything \u2014 before time was up, said David Moon, a House Democrat who co-sponsored Ms. Dumais\u2019s bill. That resulted in an informal agreement among negotiators, but no time to redraft the legislation \u2014 in print \u2014 so that it could be put to a final vote and sent to Gov. Larry Hogan. Mr. Moon said he ran down to the clerks\u2019 offices just minutes before midnight. \u201cI went down to the amendment office at 11:55 and said, \u2018Hey guys, where is this paperwork?\u2019 They said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to throw in the towel. It\u2019s not happening.\u2019\u201d Mr. Moon said he wished that the conference had convened earlier and that women had been involved in the negotiations. Now that the bill has failed, he added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have an unacceptable situation where rapists can continue to have leverage over rape survivors in Maryland.\u201d One member of the six-man conference, Joseph F. Vallario Jr., a Democrat who is chairman of the House\u2019s judiciary committee, was too busy to attend the actual meeting. But he, along with Senator Zirkin, was responsible for appointing its participants, and he stood by his decision not to name Ms. Dumais. \u201cWe try to avoid putting a sponsor on a committee,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t go with an open mind to settle the matter.\u201d (Ms. Dumais said that sponsors of bills, herself included, had participated in such conferences in the past.) Mr. Zirkin agreed, in hindsight, that more women should have been involved. The bill was one of scores to die on the last day. \u201cThere are a ton of bills, and it\u2019s still kind of archaic in terms of how it works,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that should be able to be done electronically very quickly still are not.\u201d He added he considered the bill a priority and would bring it up again if the legislature convened for a special session this year. Ms. Dumais is skeptical such a session will be called, but she is optimistic about the prospects for 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong bill, and there\u2019s no need for amendment.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/us/politics/maryland-rape-bill.html", "section": "U.S.", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "It remains one of the few states where men accused of rape can fight their victims in court for parental rights.", "title": "Another Long Delay for Rape Custody Bill in Maryland", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T11:12:38-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
