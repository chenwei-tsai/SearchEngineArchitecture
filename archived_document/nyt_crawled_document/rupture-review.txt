{"text": "The disgustingly fat spider that gives Renee (Noomi Rapace) conniptions at the start of Steven Shainberg\u2019s psychohorror movie \u201cRupture\u201d is telegraphing terrors to come. Sadly, not for the audience: Dreary, derivative and flat-out dopey, this dragged-out torture tale will disappoint even those whose hearts race whenever they see a female character strapped to a bed. And that\u2019s exactly where Renee, a spunky single mother, spends large chunks of her time after being kidnapped by three members of a weird cult and transported to a featureless medical complex. \u201cYou have something very special in you,\u201d intones one of her dispassionate captors, presumably trying to extract it through the jumbo syringe he\u2019s jabbing into her arm. Other violations follow \u2014 including some particularly repulsive nuzzling \u2014 accompanied by much writhing and screaming as Renee attempts to learn the purpose of her torment. A brief escape sends her scuttling through the air ducts like a disoriented rat to investigate the moaning and gurgling from adjacent rooms. Yet the change of scenery, however welcome, only intensifies the claustrophobia engendered by the movie\u2019s bland corridors and blank-faced persecutors. The mystery will eventually, if inadequately, be solved; the greater puzzle is why Ms. Rapace and especially Mr. Shainberg \u2014 who, almost 15 years ago, directed the dark and deliciously kinky \u201cSecretary\u201d \u2014 signed on to this generic nonsense. The script is wearyingly repetitive (as is the sound of triple locks thunk-thunk-thunking every time a door opens or closes), and the special effects are anything but. The greatest betrayal, though, is a reveal that leaves far too many unanswered questions. \u201cThis confusion is all part of the process,\u201d one villain tells Renee, comfortingly. Well, thank goodness for that.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/rupture-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:17:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:17:07-04:00", "abstract": "Noomi Rapace plays a woman subjected to jumbo syringes and repulsive nuzzling after being kidnapped by a mysterious cult.", "title": "Review: \u2018Rupture\u2019 Justifies a Fear of Spiders"}
