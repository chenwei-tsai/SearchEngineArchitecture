Information in the press about national security is misleading or flat-out wrong, offering a false sense of security. The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security perform heroic work day and night for a largely ungrateful nation. If members of Congress are unhappy with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration, they should pass new laws or \u201cshut up.\u201d Those were the main takeaways from Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly\u2019s first extensive remarks about how he intends to lead a vast bureaucracy on the front lines of immigration enforcement, passenger screening and cybersecurity. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d he said Tuesday during a speech at George Washington University. \u201cWe are in fact a nation under attack.\u201d Of course it is necessary to take seriously threats from extremist groups and criminals, and take measures against them. But they do not justify Mr. Kelly\u2019s incendiary message to his work force. The tone he sets can only encourage abusive behavior among his officers further down the chain of command against immigrants, and also lead to the curtailment of Americans\u2019 civil liberties and privacy. Mr. Kelly said that Americans have grown complacent because their government has done such a good job of keeping them safe. The reality, he warned, is quite different: \u201cWe are under attack from terrorism both within and outside of our borders. These men and women are without conscience, and they operate without rules. They despise the United States, because we are a nation of rights, of laws and of freedoms. They have a single mission, and that is our destruction.\u201d That apocalyptic talk turns the Islamophobia and immigrant scapegoating that turbocharged the Trump campaign into marching orders for federal law enforcement agents and bureaucrats. It ignores that the United States has spent billions of dollars over the past 15 years greatly enhancing its intelligence collection capabilities and that it has put in place far more stringent mechanisms to screen visa applicants and visitors. Disregarding these gains, Mr. Kelly and other top administration officials stand to make the country less safe with talk of a war on unauthorized immigrants, which is driving segments of immigrant communities underground, making them fearful of any encounters with law enforcement. The bashing of Muslims, meanwhile, is music to the ears of extremist, violent organizations that have used the notion that America is at war with Islam as a recruiting tool. Mr. Kelly\u2019s prepared remarks also telegraphed more drastic measures to come. He said a new restriction on carrying laptops and tablets onto some flights from Muslim-majority countries \u201cwill likely expand,\u201d citing, vaguely, \u201cthe sophisticated threats aviation faces.\u201d America\u2019s cyberdefenses can no longer rely on \u201cmuskets,\u201d but instead need \u201cheavy artillery.\u201d Mr. Kelly dismissed critics who have lamented his stated willingness to separate immigrant mothers and children caught entering the country, claiming that this unfathomably cruel threat would be, and indeed already has been, a useful disincentive for would-be migrants. Among the more jarring parts of Mr. Kelly\u2019s speech was his message to lawmakers. Citing the low morale of employees he described as \u201cpolitical pawns\u201d in the nation\u2019s contentious immigration debate, Mr. Kelly said members of Congress should have \u201cthe courage and the skill to change those laws,\u201d or \u201cshut up and support the men and women on the front lines\u201d of immigration enforcement. Mr. Kelly\u2019s choice of words reflects the dismal state of public discourse in American politics. That brusqueness encourages lawmakers to respond in kind, which can only make policy making more fraught and partisan. But even more alarming is his unrestrained fearmongering. If Americans take his discourse at face value, they will be living in a paranoid society willing to trade fundamental freedoms and principles for a sense of security.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T03:21:18-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/opinion/fearmongering-at-homeland-security.html", "item_type": "Article"}
