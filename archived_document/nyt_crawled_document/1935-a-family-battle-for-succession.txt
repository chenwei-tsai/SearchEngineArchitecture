Ochs did many things brilliantly, not least among them reinventing the moribund New York Times, which he purchased in 1896, as the newspaper of record. What he did not do well was plan for his successor as publisher. Long before he died, there were two able prospects in the family. The man most widely regarded as publisher material was Mr. Ochs\u2019s nephew, Julius Ochs Adler, son of Ada Ochs and Harry Adler. He was a decorated hero of the Battle of the Argonne Forest in World War I. After his return from duty in 1919, he was made a vice president and treasurer of the Times Company. The dark horse candidate was Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the husband of Mr. Ochs\u2019s only child, Iphigene. After his stateside service during the war, Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times in 1918 and was soon made a vice president. Around the same time, the couple\u2019s first child, Marian, was born. (In another era, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger would have been the obvious choice as the next publisher. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that idea occurring to Mr. Ochs at a time when women could not even vote. Nonetheless, David Halberstam wrote in 2001, no one person was ultimately as important in forming and creating The Times\u2019s culture and traditions as Mrs. Sulzberger.) What developed between the prospective male heirs was a \u201ccordial, though tense, competition,\u201d Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones wrote in \u201cThe Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times.\u201d They continued: Lending far greater urgency to the issue was Mr. Ochs\u2019s descent at this time into a deep depression that effectively left him an invalid for a year and a half. \u201cWhen my father fell ill, there was a great deal of commotion at the paper about who was to take over as publisher,\u201d Mrs. Sulzberger wrote in \u201cFrom Iphigene: The Memoirs of Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger.\u201d The matter came to the board of directors, on which Mrs. Sulzberger sat. Mr. Sulzberger and Colonel Adler, as he was called, were still in their 20s and thus not up for consideration. The candidates were Mr. Ochs\u2019s brother-in-law, Harry C. Adler, and Mr. Ochs\u2019s brother, George Washington Ochs Oakes. But Mrs. Sulzberger recalled: As the 1920s began, the contest became Colonel Adler\u2019s to lose. After all, he was a blood relative, while Mr. Sulzberger was merely an in-law. But Mr. Sulzberger began to distinguish himself. On the business side, he entered into an agreement with the Kimberly-Clark Company to develop an enormous paper mill in Ontario, thus guaranteeing The Times a constant supply of newsprint without the fluctuation of market prices. And he made a big impression on the news side by securing the exclusive rights to Charles A. Lindbergh\u2019s account of his historic solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean. All the same, Mr. Ochs was paralyzed by indecision, fearful that if he announced a successor, he would lose his own power and alienate one half of the family or the other. His ambivalence came at a cost. Mr. Sulzberger suffered a coronary occlusion in 1932 and Colonel Adler suffered a nervous breakdown in 1933. On June 8, 1934, Mrs. Sulzberger took the extraordinary step of formally addressing the succession question with her father, behind her husband\u2019s back. In a letter written from her home at 5 East 80th Street, she said: Mr. Ochs died April 8, 1935, without having named the next publisher. At least, not obviously. What he had created was the Ochs Trust, whose trustees were given the power to name the publisher, which the board would ratify. And the trustees were Colonel Adler, Mr. Sulzberger and Mrs. Sulzberger, who believed that the methodical colonel was not flexible or open-minded enough to be publisher. On May 7, the board ratified the decision of the Ochs Trust and elected Mr. Sulzberger publisher and president. Colonel Adler was given the post of general manager, which he held until his death in 1955, with the rank in the Army of major general, retired. Mindful of the toll any succession process can exact, The Times\u2019s current publisher and chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., said on Monday that the company intended to name a deputy publisher within two years. In the irreverent newsroom, this is already being called the great bake-off. But it is in fact a structured process involving two members of the board of directors, two trustees of the family trust and two members of management. Mr. Sulzberger himself is not participating. You won\u2019t find Times Insider doing any handicapping; not on the family\u2019s dime, you won\u2019t. Let it suffice to say there are six members of the fifth generation at work here now. In alphabetical order, they are: Sam Dolnick, associate masthead editor. James Dryfoos, senior director, revenue programs. Michael Greenspon, general manager, news services and international. Rachel Golden Kirscht, senior marketing manager. David Perpich, senior vice president. A. G. Sulzberger, associate masthead editor. Representing the fourth generation are Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and his cousin, Michael Golden, the vice chairman of the company. And then there is that impeccably stylish and quietly influential woman who often shows up in the 14th-floor cafeteria. Most Times employees have no idea who she is as they wait with her in line at the register, though they have probably been impressed by the collegiality that glows through her regal aura. She is Marian S. Heiskell, Iphigene and Arthur Sulzberger\u2019s eldest child, who has carried the third generation of the Ochs-Sulzberger clan well into the 21st century and far from the day she was born, when no one could have imagined who would succeed Adolph Ochs.", "item_type": "Article"}
