Disney Theatrical Productions said on Monday that it had chosen Caissie Levy to play Elsa and Patti Murin to play Anna in a musical adaptation of the 2013 animated film. The show is scheduled to have a production in Denver this summer, and then to transfer to Broadway next spring. Ms. Levy has appeared previously in five Broadway shows, including, most recently, as Fantine in a revival of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables.\u201d Ms. Murin starred in a well-reviewed but short-lived production of \u201cLysistrata Jones,\u201d and previously appeared in \u201cXanadu.\u201d Ms. Murin has been with the \u201cFrozen\u201d project throughout its development; Ms. Levy joined more recently, succeeding Betsy Wolfe, who played Elsa in a developmental lab but will instead be spending the summer in the title role of \u201cWaitress.\u201d The cast will also include Jelani Alladin as Kristoff, Greg Hildreth as Olaf, John Riddle as Hans and Robert Creighton as the Duke of Weselton. \u201cFrozen,\u201d about a princess (Elsa) struggling to harness her icy powers, and her relationship with her devoted sister (Anna), was inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, \u201cThe Snow Queen.\u201d The film was an enormous hit, won an Academy Award for best animated feature, and won another for the hugely popular song \u201cLet It Go.\u201d The stage adaptation is being directed by Michael Grandage and choreographed by Rob Ashford. Both men were brought in to replace previous members of the creative team who parted ways with Disney: Mr. Grandage succeeded Alex Timbers, while Mr. Ashford will succeed Christopher Gattelli, who in turn succeeded Peter Darling. The stage adaptation of \u201cFrozen\u201d will feature music and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, the married couple who composed the film score, and a book by Jennifer Lee, who wrote the script for the film and directed it with Chris Buck. \u201cFrozen\u201d is scheduled to run from Aug. 17 to Oct. 1 at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. Dates for the Broadway run have not been announced, but the production is planned for the St. James Theater, which will be expanded to accommodate large-scale musicals. Disney currently has two other musicals running on Broadway, \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d which opened in 1997, and \u201cAladdin,\u201d which opened in 2014. The Disney Company has also developed versions of \u201cFrozen\u201d for its theme parks and cruise ships, but those projects are unrelated to the Broadway-bound musical.", "material_type_facet": "News", "abstract": "The Disney Theatrical Group said Monday that it had chosen Caissie Levy to play Elsa and Patti Murin to play Anna in this adaptation of the 2013 film.", "title": "Disney\u2019s \u2018Frozen\u2019 Musical Casts Its Princesses", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/theater/disneys-frozen-musical-casts-its-princesses.html", "section": "Theater", "item_type": "Article"}
