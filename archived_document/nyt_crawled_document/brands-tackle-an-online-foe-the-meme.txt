{"text": "Once the infamous Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad was released and roundly criticized last month, it was only a matter of time before the memes started. One Twitter message featured a screen shot of the moment in the commercial when Ms. Jenner hands a can of Pepsi to a police officer who is responding to a protest. The caption: \u201cThrow this away for me. I\u2019m rich.\u201d Another Twitter user posted a civil rights era photo of a black man on the ground while two police officers, one with a raised baton and a fistful of the man\u2019s shirt, loomed above him. The caption on that one was: \u201cKendall please! Give him a Pepsi!\u201d Memes \u2014 those playful, satirical photographs with clever, sometimes biting captions under them \u2014 have long been used on the internet to ridicule the latest celebrity gaffe or highlight a political misstep. However, a surging number of disgruntled consumers are now using memes to target companies to complain about broken products, poor customer service and other negative experiences. That has big brands scrambling for cover. After all, the viral nature of a meme can have a faster and farther-reaching impact than a single news article. \u201cThe brand becomes a temporary punching bag for many, many people,\u201d said Jay Baer, the founder and president of Convince & Convert, a digital marketing advisory firm. \u201cPeople will pile on even if they haven\u2019t actually been aggrieved.\u201d When a Tesla Model S electric car erupted in flames in 2013, memes immediately popped up. One showed a young couple holding each other outside a burning Tesla car, with the caption \u201cKeep warm on a cold night.\u201d Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, quickly confronted the issue on the company\u2019s blog. He explained that the car had driven over a large metal object from a tractor-trailer, and he rattled off statistics that showed people were five times as likely to experience a fire in a gas-powered car as in a Tesla. The memes soon stopped. It was the perfect response, said David Pachter, a co-founder of JumpCrew, a social marketing firm in Nashville. \u201cBut not every company has an Elon Musk,\u201d he said. Samsung, the technology giant, faced a raft of memes last year when reports surfaced that the batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 phones were catching fire. One meme showed a  bomb-defusing expert in full military gear getting ready to plug in his Samsung phone, with the caption \u201cHow to safely charge your Galaxy Note 7.\u201d There wasn\u2019t much the company could do to stop the memes as phones continued to catch fire over many months, and the company ultimately pulled the device altogether. \u201cWhat are you going to say? \u2018Yep, they catch on fire. Almost all of them do. Sorry,\u2019\u201d Mr. Baer said. \u201cThere\u2019s just no good way to put that.\u201d Last month, Samsung pushed the reset button when it unveiled its new Samsung Galaxy S8 phone and virtual reality headset \u2014 and simultaneously released a #DoWhatYouCant video, which became a hit online. The video features an ostrich that dreams of flying, thanks to the Samsung VR headset and phone. The bird stumbles, before ultimately soaring in the sky. The video had more than 1.3 million views on YouTube in its first 24 hours. \u201cThey\u2019ve packaged a brilliant ad with an inspirational message,\u201d said Monica G. Sakala, the founder of SOMA Strategies, a digital agency based in Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re successfully changing the story away from the fire memes and disaster of the last phone.\u201d In general, experts recommend that companies try to address disgruntled customers directly \u2014 and the sooner, the better. They suggest that companies use \u201csocial listening\u201d software to monitor mentions of their brands \u2014 not just on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, but also on message boards, like Reddit and Tumblr, and other internet forums. If a meme shows up on a forum, it\u2019s easy to contact the person directly before it goes viral. \u201cWhen you reach out on a one-to-one level, it\u2019s amazing how frequently you can resolve that situation positively,\u201d Mr. Pachter said. \u201cBut if you let it go, it just breeds like a virus.\u201d If a meme does go viral, sometimes countering with another meme works. When a Chevrolet executive nervously stepped up to the microphone after the decisive World Series game in 2014 to present a new Chevy Colorado to the most valuable player of the Series, he breathed heavily, fumbled with his notes and then went off script: \u201cIt combines class-winning and leading, ummm, you know, technology and stuff.\u201d The awkward speech prompted a flood of memes that poked fun at \u201cChevy Guy\u201d and \u201ctechnology and stuff.\u201d \u201cTwitter just went crazy,\u201d said Melissa Schreiber, a senior vice president of social strategy at FleishmanHillard, whose team worked with Chevrolet. She and her team opted to embrace the trend by adding its own meme to the mix that night: \u201cTruck yeah the 2015 #ChevyColorado has awesome #TechnologyAndStuff! You know you want a truck.\u201d There was a surge in traffic to Chevy\u2019s website and more than $5 million in earned media exposure, Ms. Schreiber said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t try to stop the conversation from happening,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just chose the direction that we wanted to shift the conversation.\u201d Dos Equis, the beer maker, enjoyed one of the biggest boons from memes through its \u201cThe Most Interesting Man in the World\u201d campaign. A screen shot of \u201cthe most interesting man\u201d became a highly popular meme, with people replacing the character\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cI don\u2019t always drink beer. But when I do, I prefer Dos Equis,\u201d with their own comments \u2014 like \u201cI don\u2019t always say something stupid but when I do I keep talking to make it worse.\u201d And each time they did it, there was a Dos Equis bottle front and center. Some companies are creating their own memes to market products. In March, Gucci rolled out a collection of quirky memes to promote its new collection of watches. Some applauded the effort while others questioned why Gucci would be making memes to appeal to millennials, who most likely couldn\u2019t afford an $850 watch. Even if millennials can\u2019t afford the watches today, the campaign is all about leaving a lasting impression, said Amanda Ford, a senior art director at Ready Set Rocket, a New York digital agency. \u201cEven if it\u2019s years before they can buy something from Gucci, they may remember, \u2018Hey, this brand gets me.\u2019\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/business/media/brands-tackle-an-online-foe-the-meme.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T18:13:50-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T18:13:50-04:00", "abstract": "A growing number of disgruntled consumers are using satirical images to target companies \u2014 notable ones include Samsung and Pepsi \u2014 and that has brands scrambling for cover.", "title": "Brands Tackle an Online Foe: The Meme"}
