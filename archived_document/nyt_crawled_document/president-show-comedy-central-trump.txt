{"text": "Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Comedy Central unveiled \u201cThe President Show\u201d on Thursday, with the impersonator Anthony Atamanuik taking not-so-subtle jabs at President Trump from various angles. Physically, the resemblance was uncanniest when Mr. Atamanuik was strolling around New York City, waving to crowds and shoveling down food. Hee broke character just once, in an interview with Keith Olbermann, slipping into a potent analysis of horse-race politics and the enabling role of the media, before quickly switching back. \u201cI\u2019m just imitating you,\u201d he told Mr. Olbermann. A segment called \u201cNice! Not Nice!\u201d played off Mr. Trump\u2019s way of dividing the world into friends and enemies. Mr. Atamanuik closed the show with a take on Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan, clarifying that it should really be read without some of its letters. Some people took issue with the news that former President Barack Obama would accept $400,000 to speak at a conference run by a Wall Street firm. But Trevor Noah took issue with them. Over on \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with the speech either. Late shows sometimes do pretty blatant product-placement sketches. Conan O\u2019Brien has been among the most shameless \u2014 but also the best at it. Not cool, Kurt Russell. Jimmy Kimmel, who\u2019s been on break, will be back next week. So will we. Have a great weekend, and check back for more on Tuesday. The painter Mark Bradford will be representing the United States at the Venice Biennale next month. But Mr. Bradford no longer feels that the American government represents him.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/television/president-show-comedy-central-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T04:50:57-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T04:45:01-04:00", "abstract": "Comedy Central debuted its new weekly show, starring the Trump impersonator Anthony Atamanuik.
