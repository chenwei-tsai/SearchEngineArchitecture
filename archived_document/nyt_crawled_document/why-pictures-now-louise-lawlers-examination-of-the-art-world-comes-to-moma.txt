Ms. Lawler was a part of the so-called \u201cPictures Generation\u201d of the late 1970s, a group of artists who appropriated images from popular culture to consider the mechanisms of value production. She was in some ways the least noticed of the group because she addressed the emperor\u2019s-clothes aspect of art through the least showy filter: She simply took photographs of objects in museums, auction houses and private collections, and revealed them to be the pricey bric-a-brac that they are. Built into her work was a view of art\u2019s fragility \u2014 and a sense of our own, which keeps us attached to it. But what does the market care? It\u2019s never been less fragile, and with this MoMA survey, which opens on Sunday, April 30, one of its most astute critics becomes one of the season\u2019s brightest stars.
