{"text": "LONDON \u2014 The practice of office workers pitching in to buy a gift for a departing colleague \u2014 especially one with decades of service \u2014 is an old tradition. But when staff members at the Tate Modern and Tate Britain art galleries in London were asked this week to contribute to buy a gift for the Tate group\u2019s departing director, many raised eyebrows over the present: a sailboat. The timing was awkward. The call for contributions came as the Tate group, which operates four museums and art galleries across the country, was in pay negotiations with staff. The situation highlighted concerns over widening inequality in Britain before a general election in June. As in other Western countries, questions have been raised over the concentration of the benefits of economic growth with the elite, as employee rights have eroded and wages have flatlined. In the case of the Tate, a letter was posted in staff rooms asking for donations toward a going-away present for Nicholas Serota, the group\u2019s director since 1988. \u201cWe have thought long and hard about what to get, and decided to put money towards a sailing boat,\u201d the note, photos of which were posted on Twitter, said. \u201cNick loves sailing, and this would be a lasting and very special reminder of the high regard which I know so many of us have for Nick and his contribution to Tate.\u201d Pay negotiations have been tense. One trade union claimed that even after wage increases proposed by the museum group, staff pay would range from 15,707 pounds to 23,695 pounds, or about $20,230 to $30,520. By contrast, Mr. Serota made almost \u00a3200,000 in 2016-17, a Tate spokesman said. Trade unions and workers\u2019 rights advocates also complain that some people working at the Tate group\u2019s museums via outside contracting companies are subject to so-called zero-hours contracts, in which their employers do not guarantee a minimum amount of work a week. As a result, these workers do not have dependable income. At the Tate Modern art gallery, along the River Thames in London, two employees, who declined to give their names but wore Tate uniforms and identification lanyards, said workers had initially thought the request for donations was a joke. To mock the letter, one said, workers made a paper boat and affixed it to the note. \u201cThis shows how far Tate management are removed from the reality of the everyday lives of Tate staff and the fact that many of them can barely afford to pay their bills,\u201d the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents workers at the group, said by email. \u201cIt is insensitive that Tate management would even think to do this and we would encourage them to concentrate on listening to our concerns as we campaign for fair pay, more staff and an end to outsourcing at Tate.\u201d Tate, which operates the Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, and Tate St Ives and Tate Liverpool, said in a statement that the idea for the gift \u201ccame from the staff themselves who wanted to mark his 28 years of service to Tate.\u201d \u201cContributions towards the purchase of a small dinghy, which the staff thought would be an original gift, are entirely voluntary.\u201d A spokesman for the Tate group declined to elaborate on which staff members had proposed the idea and did not disclose how much money had been raised. But, in an emailed response to questions, he said, \u201cTate has reiterated to staff today that any contributions towards the gift are entirely voluntary and has apologised if the way the proposal was communicated was insensitive.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/britain-museum-tate-boat.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T15:41:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T15:41:37-04:00", "abstract": "The call for donations to buy a sailboat for the Tate group\u2019s departing director angered employees and highlighted concern over widening inequality in Britain.", "title": "At Tate Galleries in London, Parting Gift Makes Waves: A Boat"}
