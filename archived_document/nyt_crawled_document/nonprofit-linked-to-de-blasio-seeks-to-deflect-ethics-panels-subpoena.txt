The panel, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, has been investigating the nonprofit, the Campaign for One New York, since last year, seeking to determine whether it ran afoul of state regulations by failing to register as a lobbyist in 2015. The arguments, before a State Supreme Court justice, Denise A. Hartman, provided new details from the investigation, one of at least five inquiries by state and federal authorities into the fund-raising activities of Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, and the nonprofit closely tied to him, which was shuttered this year. As part of the panel\u2019s inquiry, state investigators twice interviewed Bill Hyers, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s former campaign manager who headed the nonprofit, as well as Hayley Prim, described as one of its employees. Both are now at Hilltop Public Solutions, a public relations firm. The question at the heart of the case is whether the nonprofit engaged in lobbying without registering as a lobbyist. \u201cThat is a question that we as a commission are not yet prepared to answer,\u201d Emily A. Logue, a lawyer for the state panel, told the court. \u201cThe information that the campaign is withholding goes directly to that issue.\u201d \u201cLobbying is different from advocacy,\u201d Lawrence A. Mandelker, a lawyer for the nonprofit and a partner at Kantor, Davidoff, Mandelker, Twomey, Gallanty & Kesten, said during the 58-minute proceeding. \u201cIt sounds like everybody else is investigating the mayor and they don\u2019t want to be left behind. That\u2019s what it sounds like to me.\u201d He said, borrowing a line from a United States Supreme Court opinion on pornography, that the panel appeared to believe that only it could decide what lobbying is, and that the panel knows it when it sees it. \u201cThe problem is,\u201d Ms. Logue responded, \u201cthat they will not let us see it.\u201d The arguments were the culmination of an acrimonious and increasingly public back and forth between the two parties. After providing information to the state panel for months, the nonprofit decided in May that a new subpoena \u2014 seeking expenses; agendas; meetings that the nonprofit had in conjunction with the mayor, the City Council and the State Legislature; and correspondence related to fund-raising and other information \u2014 had gone beyond the original aims of the investigation and the panel\u2019s jurisdiction. The nonprofit refused to comply, citing a political motivation on the part of the state panel, in part, because no communications with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, had been sought. In response, the panel asked the court to compel the group\u2019s compliance. Wednesday\u2019s proceeding, originally to be closed to the public, was opened after The New York Times filed a petition with the court, which the judge granted. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Hail Mary after a year,\u201d Mr. Mandelker said of the 2016 subpoena. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to let us alone unless your honor tells them to let us alone.\u201d Justice Hartman said she would deliver her decision this summer.", "item_type": "Article"}
