{"text": "The injury bug, which had relented on the Yankees after some early strikes this season, returned with a vengeance this week. The team announced on Tuesday that the struggling first baseman Greg Bird had been placed on the 10-day disabled list with a persistent ankle injury and that center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury had been shelved for at least a couple of days with an elbow injury. Bird\u2019s injury, which the team said was a bone bruise, is a lingering result of his having fouled a ball off his right ankle during the final week of spring training. Ellsbury injured himself when he crashed into the wall making a spectacular catch during the sixth inning of Monday\u2019s 7-1 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. Bird, who has played in 19 of the Yankees\u2019 first 24 games despite the injury, underwent a magnetic resonance imaging examination on Tuesday after Manager Joe Girardi said he noticed a difference in Bird\u2019s swing during his at-bats on Monday night. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel like there was a lot of explosion in his lower half,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cYesterday was the first day I really, really noticed. He said he just felt like his ankle wasn\u2019t working properly. It\u2019s just not healing as quick as we want, so we\u2019re going to try something else.\u201d Girardi said Bird would be shut down for seven to 10 days before being re-evaluated. The Yankees experienced a similar situation in 2015, when Mark Teixeira was thought to have suffered a bone bruise after fouling a ball off his leg. But after weeks without improvement, Teixeira was found to have a broken leg, an injury that went undetected despite several X-rays and M.R.I.s. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident there are no breaks,\u201d Girardi said of Bird\u2019s injury. \u201cBut bone bruises, they\u2019re tricky. Yesterday, to me, it really looked like it affected him in his swings.\u201d After leading the team in batting (.451) and leading all major leaguers in home runs (eight) in spring training, Bird has struggled at the plate since the start of the regular season. He had one hit in his first 26 at-bats before an apparent breakout game against the St. Louis Cardinals on April 16, when he had three hits, including a home run. But Bird had just two hits in his next 31 at-bats, and his batting average dipped to .100 after he was hitless in four at-bats Monday night. \u201cI tried to get through it as best as I could, but it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d said Bird, who missed the 2016 season after shoulder surgery. \u201cI definitely think I\u2019m better than what I\u2019ve showed, and I think a lot of people in there think so, too.\u201d Ellsbury also underwent an M.R.I. on Tuesday, which Girardi said revealed a bruised nerve in his left elbow, sustained when he ran into the wall after snagging a long fly by Toronto\u2019s Ryan Goins. Ellsbury finished the game but was too sore to play Tuesday night, and Girardi did not discount the possibility that he, too, might wind up on the disabled list. \u201cHe\u2019s stiff today,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait a couple days before we make a decision on what we\u2019re going to do with him. If he hasn\u2019t made some improvement, and we feel like he\u2019s not a complete player, then we\u2019ve probably got to make a move.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/sports/baseball/new-york-yankees-toronto-blue-jays-greg-bird.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T20:31:57-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T20:31:57-04:00", "abstract": "Bird, the Yankees\u2019 first baseman, has dealt with the injury since the final week of spring training.
