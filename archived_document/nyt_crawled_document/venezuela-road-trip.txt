My colleague Nicholas Casey had until recently been living in Caracas and reporting on a country on the brink of collapse. On today\u2019s episode: Mr. Casey gives his close-up account of what has gone wrong in Venezuela, and he tells us the story of a drive across the country that illustrated the problems. On that drive, he went to Matur\u00edn, a town that he says illustrates so much of what\u2019s going wrong in Venezuela. And that\u2019s where he learned the tragic story of the death of Kevin Lara Lugo. Background reading: \u2022 What the death of a 16-year-old boy in Matur\u00edn, Venezuela, tells us about the situation in that country. \u2022 Mr. Casey\u2019s reporting on the effects of Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis on hospitals, which won a George Polk Award for 2016.
