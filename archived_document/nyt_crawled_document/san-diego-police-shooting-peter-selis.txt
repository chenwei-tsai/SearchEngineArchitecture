{"text": "A gunman opened fire at a poolside party on Sunday in San Diego, killing one person and injuring at least six before the police shot and killed him as he tried to reload his weapon, the authorities said. The attack took place around 6 p.m. as people gathered around the pool for a birthday party at the La Jolla Crossroads complex in University City, near the University of California\u2019s campus in the northwest part of the city, witnesses said. The police responded after receiving reports of a shooting, and an officer in a police helicopter spotted the gunman as he appeared to be reloading his weapon, said Chief Shelley Zimmerman. Three officers on the ground arrived at the complex and confronted the gunman, and they shot him as he pointed his weapon at them, Chief Zimmerman said. The shooting victims included four women, one of whom died, and three men, Chief Zimmerman said. A fourth man injured his arm while fleeing. Chief Zimmerman identified the suspect as Peter Selis, 49, who was believed to be a resident of the complex. Six of the seven shooting victims were black, and The San Diego Union Tribune quoted witnesses as saying the gunman was white. Asked whether investigators were looking at the attack as a possible hate crime, Chief Zimmerman said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the motive is for the shooting.\u201d Mayor Kevin Faulconer described the shooting as \u201ca horrific act of violence,\u201d and he said at a news conference that the quick police response most likely prevented further bloodshed. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about the emergency response and our first responders,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI also can\u2019t say enough about our officers who responded on site today whose professionalism, whose quick action, clearly avoided further bloodshed.\u201d News reports said the gunman had been at the party before he opened fire. One resident, who identified himself only as John, told KFMB-TV that he saw the gunman \u201csitting, drinking a beer in one hand with a gun out in the other.\u201d Kaela Wong, a student at the University of California, San Diego, told The Union-Tribune that she had heard the gunman threaten someone who tried to help one of the victims. \u201cYou can either leave, or you can stay here and die,\u201d Ms. Wong said she heard the gunman say.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/san-diego-police-shooting-peter-selis.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T05:37:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T05:37:54-04:00", "abstract": "At least one person was killed and six more wounded before the police shot and killed the attacker as he tried to reload his weapon, the authorities said.", "title": "Gunman Killed in Mass Shooting at San Diego Pool Party"}
