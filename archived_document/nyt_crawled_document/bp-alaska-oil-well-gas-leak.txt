No injuries or harm to wildlife were reported, and apparently only a limited amount of oil sprayed with the gas out of the well. Still, environmentalists expressed concern about the leakage of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. A response team including state and federal agencies identified two leaks on the production well. One leak was halted on Sunday, officials said, and the second was repaired overnight. \u201cThe leak has been completely stopped, both the crude leak and the natural gas leak, which is great news for the North Slope,\u201d said Candice Bressler, spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, a state regulatory agency. It was not known how much gas leaked from the well, which is on state land a few miles from Deadhorse.", "material_type_facet": "News", "updated_date": "2017-04-17T15:28:19-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-17T15:28:19-04:00", "title": "BP Gas Leak Is Under Control in Alaska Oil Field", "source": "The New York Times"}
