Now, less than three years into his retirement, he appears to be closing in on his chance. A group including Jeter and Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and presidential candidate, has reached an agreement in principle to buy the Miami Marlins, according to a person in baseball with knowledge of the situation. The sale must be approved by fellow owners, but Major League Baseball is known to be enthusiastic about at the prospect of an ownership group including Jeter, the popular and polished former Yankees captain. The sale price is $1.3 billion, according to The Miami Herald. There are said to be multiple members of the ownership group, but Bush will apparently be the control person, following a path forged by his brother, George W. Bush, who was managing general partner of the Texas Rangers from 1989 to 1994 before embarking on a political career that eventually led to the White House, where their father had also served as president. The precise role Jeter will serve for the Marlins is not known, but he seems likely to want to be more than a figurehead. Jeter, who lives in Tampa, Fla., has been relatively active since retiring after the 2014 season, both professionally and personally. He started a website for athletes and a publishing imprint, and married the supermodel Hannah Davis. The couple is expecting their first child, a daughter, this year. Jeter earned more than $265 million in salary in his 20-year career, spent entirely with the Yankees, with whom he won five World Series and lost two, including one to the Marlins in 2003. The Marlins\u2019 manager, Don Mattingly, is another former Yankees captain. \u201cHe\u2019s always talked about it,\u201d Mattingly told the Sun-Sentinel this month, referring to Jeter\u2019s ownership aspirations. \u201cI asked him if he wanted to coach and he\u2019s like, \u2018Never.\u2019 I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be good. Jeets pretty much seems to be good at everything he tries to do.\u201d While some former superstars in other sports have pursued franchise ownership \u2013 like Mario Lemiuex, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan \u2013 there is little precedent in baseball. The Marlins have been owned since 2002 by Jeffrey Loria, a New York art dealer with a well-known fondness for former Yankees. Loria succeeded in getting a new ballpark for the franchise in 2012, but the Marlins have also been plagued by low attendance and deep distrust of ownership by the fans. While sometimes giving out lavish contracts, Loria has also, at various times, reversed course and slashed payroll with little warning. The Marlins have not reached the postseason since their 2003 championship, and their current playoff drought is the longest in the National League.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/sports/baseball/derek-jeter-jeb-bush-florida-marlins-purchase.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:08:26-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "Derek Jeter and Jeb Bush Move Closer to Purchase of Marlins", "item_type": "Article"}
