{"text": "STUTTGART, Germany \u2014 Maria Sharapova\u2019s first tournament since her contentious return to tennis is over after losing to Kristina Mladenovic in the semifinals of the Porsche Grand Prix on Saturday. Mladenovic beat Sharapova, the former world No. 1, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4. In her fourth match after a 15-month ban for doping, Sharapova missed 13 of her 16 break-point opportunities as Mladenovic rallied to win in 2 hours 38 minutes. The 19th-ranked Mladenovic, who ousted the two-time defending champion Angelique Kerber on Thursday, next plays the winner of the other semifinal between fourth-seeded Simona Halep and last year\u2019s runner-up, Laura Siegemund. Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion who tested positive for meldonium at last year\u2019s Australian Open, had been given a wild card to enter the Stuttgart event after losing her ranking because of the ban.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/sports/tennis/maria-sharapova-stuttgart.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T13:54:59-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T13:54:59-04:00", "abstract": "In her first tournament since serving a 15-month ban for doping, the former world No. 1 missed 13 break-point chances in losing to Kristina Mladenovic.", "title": "Maria Sharapova, in Return, Falls in the Semifinals in Stuttgart"}
