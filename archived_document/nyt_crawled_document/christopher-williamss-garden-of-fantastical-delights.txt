{"text": "The choreographer Christopher Williams\u2019s works are a bit like a cabinet of curiosities. They reflect his fascination with very old stories, particularly ones that include mythological beings and magical transformations. He has made phantasmagorical dances inspired by the lives \u2014 and violent deaths \u2014 of the early saints, by Greek mythology and by Scottish fairy tales, among other wild tales. To say he is an artist of peculiar obsessions is an understatement. The thing is, he believes that these stories have much to tell us about our relation to worlds unknown and to our prehistory. \u201cThey have this primal drama we can all relate to,\u201d Mr. Williams said recently over vegetarian borscht at an East Village cafe near St. Mark\u2019s Church, where his newest work, \u201cIl Giardino d\u2019Amore,\u201d will have its premiere this week. \u201cWe\u2019re all beings that experience things in a similar way because of our evolutionary history.\u201d For Mr. Williams, 41, dance \u2014 wordless and based in the body \u2014 is the logical medium for telling these stories; as he sees it, dance is \u201ca ritual we use to tell our mythology.\u201d A ritual that he reinforces by dressing his dancers in fantastical designs, usually involving sculptural adornments that make them look not quite human. The focus on visual detail (and on musicality) gives his stagings an air of sumptuousness. That he constructs such illusions within the financial constraints and pared-down aesthetics of the avant-garde dance scene makes him an anomaly. His dances can feel closer to those of Mark Morris, say, than to some of his contemporaries. But the craftsmanlike aspect of his work makes more sense when you learn that, besides being a dancer and choreographer, he is a serious puppeteer, used to making things with his hands. (He has collaborated for years with Basil Twist.) Mr. Williams developed his elaborate theatrical approach to dance at the \u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq in Paris, during a yearlong break when he was a Sarah Lawrence undergraduate. \u201cI understood there for the first time,\u201d he said, \u201cthat art forms could overlap and you could have a commingling of elements and they didn\u2019t have to have their own boundaries.\u201d The new piece is an evening-length retelling of the affair between Venus and Adonis, as interpreted by the Italian composer Alessandro Scarlatti (1660-1725) in his serenata of the same name. In Mr. Williams\u2019s staging, Venus is a symbol of fertility, bare-skinned and long-braided, her body padded with prosthetic breasts of graduated size and face framed by a beard of flowers. (Mr. Williams developed the designs with Andrew Jordan, with whom he has worked for almost 10 years.) The look alludes to both the ancient Roman Venus Barbata \u2014 or bearded Venus \u2014 and to the Ephesian Artemis, a Greek deity depicted in statues with row upon row of breasts, or maybe eggs (or even, possibly, bull\u2019s testicles). \u201cIt feels like an empowered animal femininity,\u201d said Christiana Axelsen, who is playing Venus. Wings sprout from the arms and legs of Amore (Cupid), the driver of the story, and his two minions. Layered and stiff, their feathers are more reminiscent of an iguana\u2019s crest than of a bird\u2019s soft plumage. The characters\u2019 reptilian qualities are heightened by the choreography: vigorous, even aggressive jumps, punctuated by flicks of the shoulders and wrists. Their sharp twitches are in dramatic contrast to the soft, languid, flattened movements of the lovers. They look \u201cas if they were pressed into a frame,\u201d Mr. Williams said. Scarlatti\u2019s Baroque serenata is a short entertainment for two voices and small musical ensemble meant to be performed in the home or garden of an aristocratic family. This gentle love story set in a forest glen was written for a low female voice and a castrato, a male singer castrated as a child to preserve his ability to produce the high, pure notes of a boy soprano. In the 1964 recording selected by Mr. Williams, by the Munich Chamber Orchestra, both singers are women. (The castrato part, sung here by a woman, can also be given to a countertenor.) Curiously, at least to the modern ear, the lower voice (a contralto) represents Venus, while the soprano line is given to Adonis. This pairing of a high female voice with a male character encouraged Mr. Williams to play with the idea of gender and androgyny. Adonis\u2019s movements are almost passively lovely \u2014 \u201che\u2019s very feminized, on purpose,\u201d he said. In addition, he has given both Venus and Adonis doubles, performed by dancers of the opposite sex. In typical Baroque style, the opening section of each aria is repeated; at that point, the character\u2019s double emerges, like an apparition. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the character were refracted through a prism,\u201d he explained, \u201cand suddenly you see both their genders.\u201d These doublings and mythical flights of fancy fit surprisingly neatly into Scarlatti\u2019s lovely, but rather slender, serenata. Mr. Williams has listened closely to the music, and tied each character to an individual instrument or voice. The vocal lines find direct physical expression in the movement. The words, too, are echoed by the dancer\u2019s gestures. When the contralto speaks of her love pains, Ms. Axelsen staggers slightly, as if in physical distress; when the two lovers\u2019 voices express sadness, the dancers cover their faces and curve forward, as if weighed down by emotion. The effect is subtle \u2014 less like mime and more like painterly gesture. By combining faithfulness to the music with imagery plumbed from his myth-drenched imagination, Mr. Williams has added otherworldly, almost feral dimension to this placid love story. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what I want to be doing,\u201d he said, before rushing back to rehearsal. \u201cMaking complete works of art. Worlds unto themselves in which everything is interconnected.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/dance/christopher-williamss-garden-of-fantastical-delights.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T15:47:27-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T15:47:27-04:00", "abstract": "Myth, transformation and androgyny: Mr. Williams\u2019s new dance, \u201cIl Giardino d\u2019Amore,\u201d illustrates the affair between Venus and Adonis.", "title": "Christopher Williams\u2019s Garden of Fantastical Delights"}
