{"text": "A doctor in Queens has been charged with manslaughter after one of his patients bled to death as a result of complications during an abortion he performed, prosecutors said. The doctor, Robert Rho, was arraigned on Tuesday before Judge Gregory L. Lasak of State Supreme Court in Queens after being indicted on one count of second-degree manslaughter in the death of the patient, Jamie Lee Morales, 30. Dr. Rho, who lives on Long Island and whose Queens practice is in Flushing, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Ms. Morales was injured during the July 9 procedure when \u201cDr. Rho caused a laceration of the victim\u2019s cervix, a perforation of the uterine wall, and a disruption and transection of the uterine artery,\u201d the office of the Queen district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said in a news release. Ms. Morales required an additional procedure before leaving Dr. Rho\u2019s office, but was allowed to go \u201cdespite having collapsed and appearing disoriented,\u201d Mr. Brown\u2019s office said in the news release. She was taken to a Bronx hospital after becoming unresponsive during a car ride to her sister\u2019s house. She was treated there for vaginal bleeding, but died that night, prosecutors said. The New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner ruled that Ms. Morales died after hemorrhaging from injuries of the cervix, uterus and uterine artery during an \u201celective\u201d abortion during her second-trimester of pregnancy, said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the office. Ms. Bolcer added that Ms. Morales\u2019s death had been ruled an accident. Mr. Brown said in the news release that Dr. Rho \u201crecklessly\u201d caused Ms. Morales\u2019s death, by injuring her and then failing \u201cto provide appropriate and timely medical attention.\u201d A lawyer for Dr. Rho, Jeffrey H. Lichtman, said he did not believe his client deserved to be criminally charged in Ms. Morales\u2019s death. \u201cThe fact that this turned out to be a tragedy doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s criminally responsible or civilly responsible,\u201d Mr. Lichtman said. \u201cThis is a situation that at worst could be civil negligence and at best could be unforeseen circumstances that occurred.\u201d Dr. Rho was released on Tuesday on a $400,000 bail bond. He has agreed not to practice medicine until the case is resolved, Mr. Lichtman said. Mr. Lichtman added that his client had closed his office after Ms. Morales\u2019s death on his own. \u201cHe shut it down immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was devastated.\u201d Lawyers said abortion-related deaths typically result in medical malpractice complaints and civil litigation. A few such deaths have prompted criminal charges. Dr. David Benjamin, who also practiced in Queens, was convicted in 1995 of second-degree murder in the death of a 33-year-old mother of four who was in her second trimester of pregnancy. At the time, Dr. Benjamin was the first doctor in New York State to be convicted of a murder related to the mistreatment of a patient. Jorge Santos, a criminal defense lawyer in New York, said similar cases were rare. \u201cDoctors get sued for medical malpractice all the time, but they usually don\u2019t have criminal liability,\u201d he said. Dr. Rho has been licensed to practice medicine in the state since 1991, a few years after he graduated from SUNY Downstate Medical Center. According to state medical records dating to 1990, he does not have any other malpractice, legal or disciplinary actions against him. Mr. Lichtman said his client had successfully performed thousands of abortions over the course of his career without any significant issues. \u201cThis isn\u2019t someone who\u2019s had a history of botched procedures or maintaining an unsafe office,\u201d Mr. Lichtman said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/nyregion/queens-doctor-is-charged-for-womans-death-after-abortion-procedure.html", "published_date": "2016-10-10T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T10:00:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T10:00:05-04:00", "abstract": "The doctor, Robert Rho, pleaded not guilty after he was charged in Queens with second-degree manslaughter in the death of a patient from abortion complications.", "title": "Queens Doctor Is Charged in Woman\u2019s Death After Abortion Procedure"}
