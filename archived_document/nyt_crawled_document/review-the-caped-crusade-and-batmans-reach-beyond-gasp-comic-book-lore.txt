That was before reading Glen Weldon\u2019s \u201cThe Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture.\u201d I\u2019m now of the mind that there\u2019s a continuum from normals to nerds. I land somewhere in the middle. The book is, in many respects, a roaring getaway car of guilty pleasures \u2014 film gossip, comic-book esoterica, hilarious tales of nerd rage. (For a while, the most dangerous place in Hollywood, clearly, was the space between a fanboy and Joel Schumacher, who had the audacity to add nipples to Batman\u2019s rubber costume in \u201cBatman Forever.\u201d) Mr. Weldon, a panelist on NPR\u2019s Pop Culture Happy Hour and the author of \u201cSuperman: The Unauthorized Biography,\u201d writes with humor and Day-Glo \u00e9lan. The earliest Batman comics are \u201ca crude, four-color slumgullion of borrowed ideas and stolen art\u201d; the Joker wears \u201criverboat-gambler couture.\u201d The author is also a cheerful reverse snob, celebrating the camp exuberance of the 1960s Batman TV series that so many purists loathe. \u201cThe mere existence of Adam West\u2019s Batman,\u201d he writes, \u201cbreezily yet effectively rejects the notion that the only valid Batman is a grim, gritty badass.\u201d It\u2019s a point of view that would certainly get him tossed out of Comic Book Guy\u2019s shop on \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d He doesn\u2019t care. At the 2013 Comic-Con, Mr. Weldon, then 45, waited an hour and 45 minutes for the privilege of spending 60 bucks on a plastic replica of the TV show\u2019s Batmobile. But to make it through \u201cThe Caped Crusade\u201d in one piece, I\u2019m afraid, you need to care an awful lot about Batman minutiae. I\u2019m not just talking about relishing the details of how the cape has evolved, or when the bat insignia acquired a yellow halo (Detective Comics No. 327, May 1964). I mean you also have to maneuver through a few too many plot recapitulations, follow every tortuous twist in failed Batman scripts, and keep track of a lengthy roster of artists and illustrators who collaborated across multiple decades and hundreds of issues. It\u2019s like doing some weird, literary version of the Batusi. There are a few times when the biggest villain in this book is not the Riddler but the Straw Man, a rhetorical device of which Mr. Weldon can be overly fond. And occasionally, Mr. Weldon becomes Comic Book Guy in spite of himself, writing with the same pedantry and fastidiousness. Here he is, dismissing most Saturday morning cartoons: \u201cCharacters crouched in stiff action poses and shouted thick clots of toyetic exposition.\u201d Oooff! I should make clear, though, that I come to \u201cThe Caped Crusade\u201d without a long list of fangirl bona fides, which may compromise my patience a bit. But I am Bat-curious. Like Mr. Weldon, I first came to \u201cBatman\u201d through the TV series, which ran on a candied loop of reruns when I was in first grade. I soon became obsessed with it. Mr. Weldon writes, \u201cI\u2019d run inside, kneel before the TV, and spend the hours until dinner spinning the UHF dial like a safecracker.\u201d (Honey, I so get it: Pull up a chair and sit next to me.) This Friday, \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d starring Ben Affleck as an older, wearier action hero, opens, and I\u2019ll probably use my 8-year-old son as an excuse to go see it. Yet there were sections of \u201cThe Caped Crusade\u201d that only flickeringly, fitfully held my attention. In some ways, Mr. Weldon faces the same dilemma that the directors Tim Burton, Joel Schumacher, Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder did: When you bring the story of Batman to the masses, who is it for? The normals or the nerds? Though Mr. Weldon\u2019s heart is with the normals \u2014 he\u2019s a populist, believing in the endlessly mutable splendor of his subject (he has occasionally contributed to The New York Times) \u2014 he seems to err on the side of telling his story for the nerds. And really, after his depictions of how wrathful Bat-fans can be, who can blame him? (\u201cI hope they crucify Schumacher and hang him from the tallest building in Hollywood\u201d someone wrote on an early message board called \u201cMantle of the Bat.\u201d) Anyway, I still learned a lot. Mr. Weldon starts with the basic elements of Batman\u2019s appeal: Unlike other action heroes, he has no superpowers (though he does have an enormous trust fund, which, in the author\u2019s estimation, does set him apart from most mortals); his parents were murdered in front of him as a child, which drove him to swear an oath so idealistic and melodramatic \u201cthat only a kid could make it\u201d \u2014 he\u2019d spend the rest of his life fighting criminals. The author then tells the story chronologically, starting with Batman\u2019s 1939 debut in Detective Comics No. 27. He tells us how Batman weathered the terrible reign of Fredric Wertham, the German-born psychiatrist who waged a war on comic books in the 1940s and \u201950s. He documents the perils of translating a comic book into different media. And he catalogs the many iterations of Batman, who has been endlessly reimagined and rebooted and reincarnated over the years, \u201cfrom Lone Avenger to Robin\u2019s Father to Head of an Extended Bat-Family\u201d and then back again. But his most celebrated iteration, the one that occupies privileged real estate in the hearts and minds of most Bat-nerds, is the \u201cgrim, dark, brooding, endlessly resourceful avenger\u201d of the comic\u2019s first year, who was revived in the 1970s and found his apotheosis in Frank Miller\u2019s \u201cBatman: The Dark Knight Returns\u201d in 1986. But beware of loving any one particular version of Batman too much. That\u2019s the true lesson I learned in \u201cThe Caped Crusade.\u201d It\u2019s a commitment to having your heart broken. Batman will always be subjected to the slings and arrows of outrageous appropriations. By Hollywood. By McDonald\u2019s. By Lego. By Adam West nostalgists, by fan fiction writers, by \u2014 gasp! \u2014 girls and queer theorists. \u201cThere is Batman the character,\u201d Mr. Weldon writes, \u201cand Batman the idea.\u201d The idea is always there for the taking.", "material_type_facet": "Review", "item_type": "Article"}
