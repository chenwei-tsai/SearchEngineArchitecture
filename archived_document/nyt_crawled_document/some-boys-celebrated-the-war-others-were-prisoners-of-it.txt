The contrast could not have been much sharper in the photographs this week of two groups of teenage boys. The American boys were energetically parading flags through New York City to encourage men only slightly older to enlist. The German boys \u2014 dispirited, exhausted, angry and defiant, if we can read their faces correctly \u2014 were huddled on the ground in Saint-Quentin, France, where they had been among many thousands taken prisoner by the Allies. \u201cBoys of this age in war are not a novelty,\u201d The Times said. \u201cNapoleon\u2019s Waterloo veterans were mostly under 18; and there were thousands of boys of 15 in the armies of the Civil War.\u201d As if that might bring some comfort. The \u201cWake Up, America!\u201d rally shown on the cover of the Mid-Week Pictorial had no time for ambivalence.

By day\u2019s end, however, only 70 men had joined the Army, 40 had joined the Navy and 14 had joined the Marine Corps.", "created_date": "2017-04-26T11:08:40-04:00", "section": "Times Insider", "abstract": "While the Junior Naval Scouts encouraged enlistment in New York City, young German soldiers in France reached the end of their fighting days.", "item_type": "Article"}
