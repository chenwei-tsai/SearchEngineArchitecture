{"text": "\u201cI found myself spending time with people of means \u2014 law firm partners and investment bankers, hedge fund managers and venture capitalists,\u201d Senator Barack Obama wrote in his book \u201cThe Audacity of Hope.\u201d \u201cAs a rule, they were smart, interesting people. But they reflected, almost uniformly, the perspectives of their class: the top 1 percent or so of the income scale.\u201d He wrote in 2006: \u201cI know that as a consequence of my fund-raising I became more like the wealthy donors I met. I spent more and more of my time above the fray, outside the world of immediate hunger, disappointment, fear, irrationality, and frequent hardship of \u2026 the people that I\u2019d entered public life to serve.\u201d Is it a betrayal of that sentiment for the former president to have accepted a reported $400,000 to speak to a Wall Street firm? Perhaps not, but it is disheartening that a man whose historic candidacy was premised on a moral examination of politics now joins almost every modern president in cashing in. And it shows surprising tone deafness, more likely to be expected from the billionaires the Obamas have vacationed with these past months than from a president keenly attuned to the worries and resentments of the 99 percent. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, began their post-White House careers with twin book deals reported to be worth as much as $65 million. And why not? Mr. Obama is a pathbreaking figure and established writer whose two terms traversed a stormy period economically, militarily and diplomatically. Through his writing, Mr. Obama could shed important light on his decision making. As a couple and a family, the Obamas brought grace, empathy and high standards to their time in the White House, in stark contrast to the workaday vulgarity of its current occupants. Not many administration look-backs promise education and inspiration, and the Obamas\u2019 books are much anticipated. Indeed, it\u2019s the example he set that makes it jarring to see him conform to a lamentable post-presidential model created fairly recently, in historical terms. Since Gerald Ford enriched himself with speaking fees and board memberships after leaving office, every former president but Jimmy Carter has supped often at the corporate table. It\u2019s not beyond imagining that Mr. Obama could break with a practice whose ills he observed so astutely, and which contributed to the downfall of the Democrat he hoped would cement his legacy. The tens of millions that Hillary Clinton raised from speaking to corporate interests most likely haunts her now \u2014 or should. The Obamas are starting a foundation whose work will include \u201ctraining and elevating a new generation of political leaders in America,\u201d Eric Schultz, an Obama adviser, said in a statement. \u201cPresident Obama will deliver speeches from time to time. Some of those speeches will be paid, some will be unpaid, and regardless of venue or sponsor, President Obama will be true to his values, his vision, and his record.\u201d But why not elevate a new generation of political leaders and stay true to his values by giving his speech fees to his foundation and other charities focused on those goals? The Democratic Party badly needs such an example to follow. As the presidential election clarified so painfully, the traditional party of working people has lost touch with them. In a poll released last week, more than two-thirds of voters, including nearly half of Democrats themselves, said the Democratic Party is out of touch with the concerns of the American people. For the first time in memory, Democrats are seen as more out of touch with ordinary Americans than the party\u2019s political opponents. There\u2019s little doubt that Democratic leaders\u2019 unseemly attachment to the party\u2019s wealthiest donors contributed to that indictment. From Mr. Obama\u2019s earliest days in government, he wrestled with what it means to be a representative public servant in an era of purchased influence. He didn\u2019t always make the right decisions, he acknowledged. Now, as he commits to building future American leaders, we have the audacity to hope he\u2019ll set a higher standard for past presidents.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/opinion/the-cost-of-barack-obamas-speech.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T03:26:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "created_date": "2017-05-01T03:21:15-04:00", "abstract": "In an era of purchased influence, why can\u2019t former President Barack Obama set a higher standard?", "title": "The Cost of Barack Obama\u2019s Speech"}
