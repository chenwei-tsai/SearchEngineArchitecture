{"text": "Good morning on this sunlit Friday. With April came the start of fishing season in New York. And for a city, its fishing prospects are superb, we are told. \u201cIt astounded me \u2014 the angling opportunities, the species diversity and the fact that you can catch a trophy fish with the Empire State Building behind you,\u201d said Darin Alberry, a fisheries biologist for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and a longtime angler. New York Harbor is home to an abundance of small invertebrates that attract the larger, predator species that anglers are trying to catch. Between now and June is what Mr. Alberry calls \u201cprime time\u201d for those who fish in New York. During early spring, the most sought-after trophy fish, or \u201cgame species,\u201d in our waters are striped bass (migrating down the Hudson and East Rivers) and bluefish (coming from deeper water offshore). Want to give it a try? If you\u2019re a beginner, Mr. Alberry suggested starting with freshwater fishing at these locations across the boroughs. These lakes, ponds, rivers and streams are catch-and-release locales (\u201cCatch a fish, pick it up, take a picture, and put it back in the water,\u201d Mr. Alberry said). You can expect to find members of the sunfish family \u2014 pumpkinseed, bluegills and largemouth bass. If you\u2019re 16 or older, you\u2019ll need to purchase a license. You can also learn to fish through the state\u2019s free  clinics at I FISH NY. For the more advanced angler, Mr. Alberry suggested saltwater fishing at these locations. (Unlike catch-and-release freshwater fishing, you can \u201cgo out, fish\u201d and \u201ctake it home for dinner\u201d if your catch-of-the-day meets these regulations.) You\u2019ll need to be on the marine registry, and you can get the free license here. Study the local tides and currents before you go. (Find information on where to fish, when to fish and more on the Department of Environmental Conservation\u2019s fishing, hunting and wildlife app.) And if you\u2019re not keen on fishing but love the water, look for dolphins, whales, sea otters, seals or green turtles when you take a ferry. Here\u2019s what else is happening: Well hello, sunshine. Your cloudy commute could be hit with rain showers, but by midmorning the skies begin to clear \u2014 revealing blue skies and a high near 79. Ideal weather for dropping a line, watching the tide roll away, and wastin\u2019 time. Saturday is looking warm and muggy, Sunday should have some sun, with temperatures in the low 60s. \u2022 New York firefighters said goodbye to William N.

There\u2019s a place in New York that looks more like ancient Egypt than modern-day Manhattan: It\u2019s the Temple of Dendur. The aeolian sandstone temple, built in the first century B.C. on the banks of the Nile, officially became a New York transplant 50 years ago today, on April 28, 1967, when President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The impetus for relocating the monument was, in large part, to protect it against flooding from the rising waters of the Nile. It was quite the process. The temple was dismantled in Egypt, packed into crates and placed aboard the Concordia Star freighter and transported across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City. The blocks were then loaded onto large trucks that rolled south down Fifth Avenue. The structure was reassembled by conservators and stonemasons at the Met. The Temple of Dendur is closed this weekend but will reopen to the public on May 5, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. New York Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. till late morning.
