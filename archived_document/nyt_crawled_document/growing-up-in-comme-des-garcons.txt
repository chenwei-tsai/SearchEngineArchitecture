{"text": "In any conversation about the work of the designer Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, the subject of a new one-woman show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, about halfway through, when the topic of, say, her \u201clumps and bumps\u201d dress or some other confounding configuration comes up, someone will inevitably cry: \u201cBut who would wear such a thing?\u201d I can tell you, because I grew up with her. My mother, an art dealer for a gallery in SoHo in the 1980s, wore Comme des Gar\u00e7ons (\u201cCdG\u201d to us) almost exclusively. Like many art-world people at that time, she wore it as her uniform, and she would buy several new pieces each season and rotate them throughout the week. By the time I was ten, the name Rei Kawakubo rolled off my tongue like a family member\u2019s. I always knew when my mom had been shopping because she would come home, lay the huge, flat paper bag \u2014 it looked like an oversize envelope \u2014 on her bed, carefully unwrap her pieces (generally all black), slip off whatever she\u2019d worn to work, and ask me to come in and help her figure out how to put on her new purchases again. There were mysterious flaps, trains floating off tailored jackets that attached at one of three places in the back or the front, and, frequently, extra armholes \u2014 my mother called them \u201coptions\u201d \u2014 to figure out. Just because six buttons appeared to be in a row did not mean they were to be buttoned in that order. When we thought we\u2019d gotten something right \u2014 a three-piece wool top with multiple places for your head to pop through, for example \u2014 she would run across our loft to the only mirror (in the bathroom), then reappear shaking her head. It wasn\u2019t how it had looked at the store, and we would start again. Among my favorite pieces were an elegant black jacket with traditional men\u2019s-wear lapels, on which my mother wore three cameos that had belonged to my grandmother; slouchy navy overalls that crisscrossed in the back and looked like they\u2019d been designed for a little boy; and a \u201csweater\u201d with sleeves that ended in gloves (which she had to wear beneath a high-necked jacket, since it was cropped to just above the bust line). A well-meaning dry cleaner once offered to \u201cfix the bottom\u201d of a dress with a deliberately raw hem, telling her with much empathy, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you should go around like this.\u201d When we went on holiday to Egypt in the winter of 1988, our luggage was lost and we had to wear our traveling clothes for our first three days in Cairo. There are pictures of my mother, in the desert astride a camel, in high heels and a sleeveless, bias-cut, billowing black-silk CdG dress. I wore a uniform throughout middle school, so I had little need for clothes except on the weekends, when my friends and I would loiter in Canal Jean and shop Broadway\u2019s street vendors for rubber bracelets and fluorescent socks. The annual school dance was another story, and for much of the late \u201980s I ached for one of Betsey Johnson\u2019s black Lycra tube dresses. \u201cWe have plenty of clothes at home; you\u2019ll wear something of mine,\u201d my mother told me more than once. And so, my debut party looks included navy and black pinstriped men\u2019s-wear-inspired CdG jackets with slight bustles and trains which, on a seventh grader, could be passed off as dresses. My mother wore white for her second wedding: a fitted, handmade-lace CdG evening jacket with an asymmetric train (a more elaborate, romantic version of her black daywear), a silk skirt with a layered handkerchief hem, and a veiled hat that she now denounces as \u201ctoo flowery,\u201d copied after one she\u2019d bought years before in Paris. I wore a skirt that matched hers and a sleeveless cotton poplin blouse that had several askew buttons going diagonally down the side, and which tied in a huge structured bow over one shoulder. This ensemble made a repeat performance at my eighth-grade graduation, where a white dress was required. I longed painfully for prim, lacy Laura Ashley, but \u201cyou already have something white\u201d was the answer. So in I strode, with uneven hem and a top that looked like I\u2019d buttoned it in the dark, festooned with a bow that was competing in size with my head. Faculty eyes bulged. Parents appeared puzzled and disapproving. Classmates \u2014 who were, of course, all wearing my dream of lawn-sweeping, eyelet Laura \u2014 snickered. I cringed. In high school, one memorable winter formal outfit was a two-piece black velvet number of my mother\u2019s, consisting of a long-sleeve top and a pair of matching \u201cpants\u201d with three pant legs. One was straight and cropped above the ankle; another was draped in a blousy fashion; the third was akin to a short-short. \u201cHow do I wear this, Mom?\u201d I asked. \u201cAny way you want,\u201d came her answer. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun, baby.\u201d The (eventual) lesson for me was that it\u2019s O.K. \u2014 to my mother it was preferable \u2014 to look different, as long as you look like yourself. When I think of that era when I was figuring out who I was, and who she was, it\u2019s always in terms of her clothes. Those cerebral, poetic, beautifully tailored, utterly individual, sometimes-challenging-to-other-people pieces gave her power and confidence. (So did really great lingerie, she would lecture me as a child.) They were, and are to this day, our secret language. She didn\u2019t look like the other moms, but I was always proud that this one, with her delicately destroyed hems, was mine. She really believed that you could do and be anything you wanted, and that, sartorially, you could get away with whatever you dared, as long as you stood up straight and wore it with a smile. Which she always did.
