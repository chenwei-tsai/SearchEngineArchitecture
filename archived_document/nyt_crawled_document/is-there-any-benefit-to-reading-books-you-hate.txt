{"text": "Have you ever been assigned a book for school that you simply loathed? Did you finish it? Did you learn anything, despite your dislike? Think about required reading, and the demands it places on your time, your brainpower and your emotions. Are there any hidden benefits to required reading assignments? In \u201cWhy You Should Read Books You Hate,\u201d Pamela Paul writes: Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: \u2014 Have you ever voluntarily chosen a book you disliked for recreational reading? Why or why not? If so, did you read it to the end? And what did you learn in the process? \u2014 How are readers benefited by seeking out and finishing books they dislike? \u2014 In your own future reading life, will you make it a personal goal to read books you are sure you will not enjoy? Why or why not? If so, what might you choose to read, and why? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.
