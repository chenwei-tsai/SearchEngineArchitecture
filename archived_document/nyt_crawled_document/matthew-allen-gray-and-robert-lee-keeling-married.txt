The Rev. Susan N. Eaves, an Episcopal priest, officiated. Mr. Gray, who is 33 and works in Richmond, is the Virginia state director for the Humane Society of the United States. He graduated from James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., and serves on the university\u2019s board of visitors. He is the son of Carolyn M. Gray and Robert A. Gray of Richmond. His mother retired as a registered nurse at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital there. His father retired as a lieutenant with the Richmond Police Department. Mr. Keeling, 44, is a managing vice president in human resources for Capital One Financial Corporation, also in Richmond. He graduated from Schreiner University in Kerrville, Tex., and received a master's degree in human development from George Washington University. He is a son of Donna J. Keeling and Robert L. Keeling Sr. of Medina, Tex. His mother is the admissions counselor for the vocational nursing program at Schreiner University. His father is the supervisor of engineering services at the Kerrville Public Utility Board. Mr. Gray (center) and Mr. Keeling met in April 2015 at Richmond Triangle Players, a performing arts theater. At the time, Mr. Gray was a member of the theater\u2019s board of directors and Mr. Keeling was a patron out with friends for the evening. Shortly before the show began, Mr. Gray, who had been chatting with one of Mr. Keeling\u2019s friends at the theater bar, helped carry in a few drinks, including Mr. Keeling\u2019s apple martini. \u201cIt was all kind of serendipitous,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cI went alone to the theater that night, which is something I never do.\u201d He handed Mr. Keeling his drink and sat beside him, and they engaged in small talk for 10 minutes. \u201cHe was very handsome and charming,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cThere was this intensity about him that made me feel connected to him immediately, and I definitely wanted to continue the conversation.\u201d As did Mr. Keeling. \u201cAt some point before the show I heard the sound of Matthew\u2019s laughter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a comforting and familiar sound.\u201d Their conversation continued later that week, when they went on a first date at a restaurant. They talked about family. Mr. Keeling shared about how his son, Max, was adopted and very close to his great-grandmother, Marian Salmons. \u201cWe also discussed our jobs and world events,\u201d Mr. Keeling said. \u201cNothing was off limits. I soon realized that while Matthew is very intelligent and super fierce when it comes to politics, he\u2019s also an extremely romantic and sensitive person, and a real big softy when it comes to animals.\u201d They began dating steadily, and it wasn\u2019t long before Mr. Keeling introduced Max, then 10, to Mr. Gray, bringing Max along on one of their initial dates. Mr. Gray was soon wondering, and hoping, that he too would become one of Max\u2019s favorites. \u201cI was a little nervous because on the one hand, I had met this wonderful guy, but on the other hand there was another person in the mix for me to impress,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cThis was really foreign territory for me.\u201d They met at Mr. Keeling\u2019s home and walked to a nearby restaurant for dinner, where Max entertained them with his collection of Pokemon cards. \u201cMax was so outgoing and inquisitive,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cI felt a wonderful connection between all three of us, but I was still a bit nervous and uncertain about how Max was feeling toward me, and how it would affect my relationship with Rob.\u201d After dinner, they walked to a nearby cafe for dessert. Mr. Gray\u2019s nerves were soon settled when Max unexpectedly walked between them and held each one\u2019s hand. \u201cA feeling of fearlessness, optimism and the sense that we would build our lives together rushed through me,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cThose were the first steps to the start of our new, modern family.\u201d", "section": "Fashion & Style", "title": "And a Son Makes Three", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/fashion/weddings/matthew-allen-gray-and-robert-lee-keeling-married.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T12:18:16-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T12:18:16-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
