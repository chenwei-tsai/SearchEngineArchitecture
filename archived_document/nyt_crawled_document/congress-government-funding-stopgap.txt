{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Friday approved a stopgap spending measure that will keep the federal government open for another week and the Senate is expected to give its approval as well, averting a shutdown this weekend as lawmakers finalize a long-term spending package. The move would also avoid the political embarrassment of a shutdown on Saturday, President Trump\u2019s 100th day in office. The measure approved by the House would continue government operations at current funding levels through next Friday. By that point, congressional leaders hope to have passed a spending package that will cover the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said the short-term measure \u201cenables us to continue to serve our constituents.\u201d \u201cWhile being far from ideal, it\u2019s exactly what we need to do,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. Final negotiations on the long-term spending package played out this week as House Republican leaders tried to round up the necessary votes to move ahead on another consequential matter, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Some White House officials had hoped a vote on a revised House bill to repeal the health law would take place before Saturday \u2014 a step that, if successful, would have showed that Mr. Trump was making progress on a central campaign promise. This week, the revised bill won the backing of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which received much of the blame for the demise of the House\u2019s earlier repeal bill in March, a legislative catastrophe for both Mr. Trump and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. But the revised bill has drawn opposition from a sizable group of moderate Republican members, and House Republican leaders opted not to hold a vote on the measure on Friday. \u201cLet us begin by being thankful that we\u2019re not going to do great harm to our country this week,\u201d Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said on the House floor on Friday morning. But he offered a word of caution: \u201cNow, there\u2019s always next week.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/politics/congress-government-funding-stopgap.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T11:07:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T11:07:16-04:00", "abstract": "The measure would keep the government running at current funding levels for a week.", "title": "House Approves Stopgap Funding Measure, Senate Expected to Follow"}
