{"text": "For nearly 20 years, Debrah Lee Charatan has tried to stay outside the media spotlight trained on her husband, Robert A. Durst, who is facing trial in Los Angeles in the killing of Susan Berman, his confidante. But that may be ending. In a $100 million lawsuit filed Monday in State Supreme Court in Mineola, N.Y., by Carol Bamonte, Mary Hughes and Virginia McKeon, the three sisters of Mr. Durst\u2019s first wife, Kathleen Durst, Ms. Charatan is described as a \u201ccoldblooded opportunist\u201d who in cooperation with Mr. Durst \u201cconspired and agreed to conceal the whereabouts\u201d of Kathleen Durst\u2019s body from her family. Ms. Durst disappeared in 1982. Her body has never been found. Ms. Charatan, a real estate executive in New York, controls her husband\u2019s financial affairs, pays his team of lawyers and is the chief beneficiary of Mr. Durst\u2019s 2003 will and an estate worth an estimated $100 million. Among the many twists and turns of Mr. Durst\u2019s 35-year tale is the fact that Ms. Charatan lives with Steven Holm, a real estate lawyer who has worked for Mr. Durst, 74. The claims about Ms. Charatan were made in an amended complaint to a 2015 suit. The new filing contends that Mr. Durst killed Ms. Durst and that he, Ms. Charatan and others violated Ms. Durst\u2019s family\u2019s right to sepulcher, a rarely used New York law granting relatives the right to immediate possession of a body for burial. Alan M. Abramson, a lawyer for Ms. Charatan, declined to comment. Although investigators have long suspected Mr. Durst of killing his first wife, he has never been charged in connection with her disappearance. Prosecutors in Los Angeles say that Mr. Durst shot Ms. Berman in the back of head in 2000 to stop her from telling investigators what she knew about Ms. Durst\u2019s killing. Ms. Berman, a writer, had been Mr. Durst\u2019s spokeswoman after his first wife vanished. In pretrial hearings in Los Angeles, several witnesses testified that Ms. Berman had told them that she had helped Mr. Durst conceal his role in his wife\u2019s disappearance. Ms. Charatan did not meet Mr. Durst until 1988, when friends introduced them. The lawsuit contends that Mr. Durst confided in Ms. Charatan and others the location of Ms. Durst\u2019s body and that she agreed to keep his secrets in return for cash. But it does not say how or when he confided in Ms. Charatan, whom he married in a secret ceremony in 2000, shortly after he learned that the authorities had reopened the investigation into his first wife\u2019s fate. The suit states that Ms. Charatan obtained power of attorney from Mr. Durst and supplied him with tens of thousands of dollars in cash after he fled New York and rented apartments in Galveston, Tex., and New Orleans under an alias while posing as a mute woman. Mr. Durst was charged with murder in 2001 after he dismembered the body of a neighbor in Galveston and led the authorities on a 45-day hunt before being captured in Pennsylvania. At one point, Ms. Charatan tried to withdraw $1.8 million from one of Mr. Durst\u2019s bank accounts, but the account had been frozen by the authorities. Mr. Durst was acquitted of murder charges, after he testified that the neighbor, Morris Black, had died when shot accidentally as they grappled over a gun. Mr. Durst testified that in a panic he carved up the body and dumped the pieces into Galveston Bay. Long estranged from his wealthy New York family, Mr. Durst sued the family trust seeking a payout and settled for $65 million in 2006. Ms. Charatan received about $20 million. Dick DeGuerin, who leads Mr. Durst\u2019s defense team in Los Angeles, said his client was innocent. \u201cIt\u2019s been a mystery for over 35 years what happened to Kathie, for Bob and everybody else,\u201d Mr. DeGuerin said. \u201cAs far as Susan is concerned, Bob didn\u2019t kill her and doesn\u2019t know who did.\u201d Ms. Charatan and her son, Bennat Charatan Berger, are owners of a number of tenement buildings in Brooklyn and Manhattan. In February, Ms. Charatan filed a $10 million defamation suit against 25 people who had posted anonymous critical items online about the management of the buildings. The lawsuit, which identifies the online critics only as John or Jane Doe, says that they posted false and scurrilous statements about Ms. Charatan and her son, including one that described them as \u201ctwo most infamous and abusive landlords in New York City.\u201d Her husband, Mr. Durst, is referred to in one posting as \u201ca famous serial killer and sociopath.\u201d The new complaint from Ms. Durst\u2019s family also names Mr. Durst\u2019s friend Susan Giordano, claiming that he told her the location of Ms. Durst\u2019s body. Ms. Giordano got to know Mr. Durst while he was in jail in Galveston. Ms. Giordano testified in February in Los Angeles that Mr. Durst had given her $350,000 to find what she called a \u201clove nest,\u201d where she could take care of him for the rest of his life. Ms. Giordano insisted that their relationship was platonic, and not romantic. Benjamin Ostrer, a lawyer for Ms. Giordano, declined to comment, saying he had not seen the complaint. A lawyer for Ms. Durst\u2019s sisters, Robert Abrams of Abrams Fensterman, said that because of the suit, \u201cCharatan, Giordano and others will now have to explain why they collectively accepted tens of millions of dollars to help Durst conceal his involvement in the disappearance of Kathie.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/nyregion/dursts-2nd-wife-helped-conceal-killing-of-first-suit-caims.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T17:11:56-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T17:10:46-04:00", "abstract": "Sisters of Kathleen Durst say that Debrah Charatan, who married Robert Durst in 2000, helped keep them from finding Ms. Durst\u2019s body.", "title": "Durst\u2019s 2nd Wife Helped Conceal Killing of First, Suit Claims"}
