Brown would spend at least 22 hours a day alone in his cell. On some days, he might get to spend an hour alone in the common room or an outdoor courtyard. And every once in a while, he would secretly tap fingertips with other inmates, through the metal lattices on their cellblock doors. It was the only physical human contact he could find, Mr. Brown said in a phone interview. \u201cI could talk to a guard, but I tried not to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re out to get you.\u201d Mr. Brown was released from prison in 2015 after evidence problems surfaced in his case and his murder conviction was thrown out. His experience at the Polunsky Unit is among dozens included in a critical report released Monday by the Human Rights Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. Its authors concluded that solitary confinement in Texas violates international human rights standards and amounts to a form of torture. Ariel E. Dulitzky, a law professor who runs the clinic and is an author of the report, said that solitary confinement practices in Texas, in particular, are hurting the United States when it comes to human rights. \u201cWe decided that it was important, as a university in Texas, to pay attention to what was happening here \u2014 why Texas was bringing this international criticism against the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Dulitzky said. The study was small and qualitative, analyzing questionnaire responses from 32 former Polunsky Unit inmates. It found that prisoners at the unit, in Livingston, Tex., suffered psychological problems as a result of confinement, compounded by a lack of access to health care and changes to execution schedules that forced some prisoners to prepare for death more than once. Mr. Brown, 35, remembers a never-ending cacophony there. \u201cEverybody\u2019d be talking over one another in there, so it\u2019s like one big, bad radio station that can\u2019t get a signal,\u201d he said. \u201cI lived in that cell like I was \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t even explain it. I put myself in that cell and just, like, zoned out.\u201d The report refers to Texas\u2019 death row practices as \u201cparticularly draconian,\u201d pointing out, for example, that Polunsky Unit prisoners do not share meals or recreational time with other inmates; cannot have physical contact with their families, even on their way to execution; and are held in solitary confinement as a matter of policy, rather than for safety or disciplinary reasons. Mr. Dulitzky acknowledged that other states with capital punishment have similar policies. He maintained, however, that Texas is unusual in that it uses all of these practices. There are currently 233 men on death row at the Polunsky Unit, said Jason Clark, the public information director for the state\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice. (Six women with death sentences are being held at another prison.) \u201cOffenders on death row are individuals who have been convicted of heinous crimes and given the harshest sentence possible under the law,\u201d Mr. Clark said in an emailed statement, adding that the department would \u201ccontinue to ensure it fulfills its mission of public safety and house death row offenders appropriately.\u201d Mr. Dulitzky acknowledged that many people in Texas were not concerned about prison conditions at the Polunsky Unit because inmates there have been convicted of the most severe offenses, like murder and rape. \u201cWe agree that if somebody commits a crime, they should receive a punishment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we say, at the same time, that once you impose a punishment on a person, you need to keep treating that person with humanity and with dignity.\u201d Critics of Texas\u2019 prison policies come from inside the system, as well. Lance Lowry, who is the president of the union chapter that represents correction workers in Huntsville, Tex., has been working in Texas prisons for decades. He said his objections to the state\u2019s solitary confinement practices have more to do with efficacy than civil rights. \u201cWe really need to focus a lot more on behavior modification and giving officers more tools to manage these prison populations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you take everything away from prisoners, you have nothing to manage them with. And they can become very dangerous when they have nothing to lose.\u201d The question now, Mr. Dulitzky said, is whether Texas\u2019 Criminal Justice Department will listen to its critics. \u201cGenerally, the attitude has been a strong lack of transparency from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice,\u201d he said. The report recommends using solitary confinement only as \u201ca measure of last resort,\u201d offering religious services and ensuring that inmates have access to natural light and fresh air. Mr. Lowry said that the system is not open to constructive criticism. \u201cRetaliation is real,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people do speak out, these agencies don\u2019t like it, and a lot of people are scared to voice their concerns. I\u2019ve definitely stepped out on a limb.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T10:13:05-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "abstract": "The report called the state\u2019s death row practices \u201cparticularly draconian,\u201d pointing out, for example, that some prisoners can\u2019t have physical contact with relatives, even on their way to execution.", "item_type": "Article"}
