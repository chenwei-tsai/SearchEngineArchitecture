{"text": "Labeling a high school freshman a \u201cgreat kid\u201d with \u201cawesome parents\u201d and a 3.5 grade point average would usually be the ultimate compliment. But when it comes to an unarmed black teenager who died at the hands of the police, such remembrances become fraught with questions over how black victims are perceived. That is what happened after a police officer in suburban Dallas fatally shot Jordan Edwards, 15, late Saturday night. Jordan was sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat of a car that was driving away from the officer who fired at it, Chief Jonathan Haber of Balch Springs said, adding that the shooting \u201cdid not meet our core values.\u201d In the aftermath, those who knew Jordan well were quick to laud the person he was. \u201cAwesome parents,\u201d Chris Cano, the father of a friend, told a local television station, WFAA. \u201cHe was not a thug. This shouldn\u2019t happen to him.\u201d Those comments were published in a New York Times article, and readers were critical of the narrative that such a quotation painted. \u201cIt implies that there could be a scenario in which police killing a person without cause is justifiable based on the victim\u2019s past experiences,\u201d Cassidy Fogg wrote on The Times\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIt\u2019s also a sentence that probably wouldn\u2019t appear in an article about a white victim.\u201d Activists for police accountability have long argued that black people killed by the police are too often the ones put on trial afterward, rather than the officers who shot them. If the shooting was unjustified, does it matter whether the victim had accumulated accolades? \u201cAnd besides, how the hell do the police know his past when they arrive on a scene and start shooting,\u201d another reader, Elizabeth Anderson, wrote on The Times\u2019s Facebook page. Although an array of studies have shown racial disparities in the criminal justice system, the default thinking among many Americans is often to assume that black people killed by the police were up to no good, and that their pasts somehow contributed to their fatal interactions with the authorities, activists and academics say. That is a much easier narrative to swallow than the alternative \u2014 \u201cthat we\u2019re looking at faulty policing,\u201d said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African-American Studies and English at Duke University. \u201cThere\u2019s a narrative about the kind of activities that young black men engage in,\u201d Mr. Neal said. And the death of black people at the hands of police officers can often set off a defense mechanism among the deceased\u2019s\u2019 family and friends. They emphasize that those killed were not bad people, that they did not play into society\u2019s jaded expectations. A lawyer for Jordan\u2019s family, S. Lee Merritt, told The Dallas Morning News: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard excuses before in the past: You know why it happens, because the dads aren\u2019t present. That excuse isn\u2019t here. Or the kid was violent. That excuse isn\u2019t present here.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/us/he-was-not-a-thug-questions-of-language-trail-police-killings.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T14:39:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T14:39:16-04:00", "abstract": "Descriptions of black people fatally shot by police officers, even complimentary ones, often raise debate over how African-Americans are perceived.", "title": "\u2018He Was Not a Thug\u2019: Questions of Language Trail Police Killings"}
