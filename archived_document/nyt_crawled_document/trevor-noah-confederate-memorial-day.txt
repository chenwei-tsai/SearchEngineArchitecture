{"text": "Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com Trevor Noah expressed his amazement on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Wednesday that something called Confederate Memorial Day still exists, even if it\u2019s just in Alabama and Mississippi. \u201cWhat are black people supposed to do on this holiday?\u201d he asked. He imagined the dilemma: \u201cSo I either don\u2019t get the day off, or I support slavery? Man, I\u2019ll take the day off, but I\u2019m watching B.E.T. the whole time.\u201d President Trump, who as a candidate criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s use of executive orders, is now touting the fact that he will have signed 30 of them within his first 100 days. On \u201cLate Night,\u201d Seth Meyers hit on a way to understand \u2014 and maybe even predict \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s apparently contradictory statements. Also less than clear is the timetable for Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the Mexican border. Mr. Meyers played a clip of the president being barraged with questions about when the wall would be built. Asked if it would be during his first term, he seemed reluctant to answer, then abruptly said, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d What to make of the new partnership between, of all people, Derek Jeter and Jeb Bush? Late night had some thoughts. The flinch of the furious. Maybe you sometimes wonder when a comedian is telling a true story and when she\u2019s making it up. If you had Dr. Phil\u2019s professional expertise, you wouldn\u2019t have to wonder. Senator Bernie Sanders, who just began a push for a federal $15 minimum wage, will speak to Seth Meyers on \u201cLate Night.\u201d And \u201cThe President Show,\u201d hosted by Anthony Atamanuik as President Trump, will debut on Comedy Central right after \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Watch this space for updates. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d isn\u2019t just a breathlessly praised new show. It marks the resuscitation of two careers.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/television/trevor-noah-confederate-memorial-day.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:08:53-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:08:53-04:00", "abstract": "The \u201cDaily Show\u201d host pondered the dilemma faced by black residents of Mississippi and Alabama: \u201cSo I either don\u2019t get the day off, or I support slavery?\u201d", "title": "Trevor Noah Has a Hard Time With Confederate Memorial Day"}
