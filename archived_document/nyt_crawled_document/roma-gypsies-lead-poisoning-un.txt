{"abstract": "More than year after a panel of experts recommended an apology and compensation for Roma people sickened by lead poisoning in a United Nations camp, the victims are not optimistic.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "A panel of United Nations human rights advisers urged the global organization more than a year ago to publicly apologize and compensate hundreds of ethnic Roma who were poisoned by lead waste in decrepit camps run by its peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. But it is increasingly unclear whether the Roma, also known as Gypsies, will get even an apology. A draft statement that would \u201csincerely apologize\u201d for the poisoning and other problems that the panel attributed to negligence by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, known as Unmik, has been under revision since March, according to people in and outside the United Nations who are knowledgeable about the deliberations. Those people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were talking about internal United Nations discussions, also said that the precise mechanism and amount of any financial remedy, should there be one, had not been determined. The main obstacle, they said, was the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs\u2019 objections to any language in the statement that could be construed as acknowledging liability. A copy of the draft statement was obtained by The New York Times. \u201cThere is a natural process on these issues, especially one as important as this,\u201d St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Tuesday. \u201cThe discussions are still very much ongoing, and the secretary-general expects to make a decision very soon.\u201d The issues surrounding the lead poisoning, which affected as many as 500 people in three camps that have long since closed, reflect an underlying tension within the United Nations over grievances from civilians victimized by the organization\u2019s operations around the world. As in the much larger cholera scourge that was traced to infected United Nations peacekeepers in Haiti, the organization\u2019s lawyers have tended to resist any acceptance of legal responsibility or mandatory compensation to victims. Even when the United Nations acknowledged a role in the Haiti cholera crisis in 2016, after years of denial and assertions of diplomatic immunity from lawsuits, rights advocates said its apology was carefully worded to avoid direct responsibility, and the compensation plan was structured as a voluntary act of good will, not as a requirement. Critics of the United Nations say its behavior in both the Haiti cholera and the Roma lead poisoning in Kosovo have undercut its moral authority. \u201cThe broader point is if you didn\u2019t do it for Haiti, and you don\u2019t do it for Kosovo, you don\u2019t have to do it for anyone,\u201d said Philip Alston, a New York University law professor and United Nations special rapporteur for extreme poverty and human rights. Mr. Alston wrote a scathing appraisal last year of the United Nations behavior during the cholera epidemic, which killed nearly 10,000 Haitians and sickened roughly 800,000. He also faulted its financial remedy, a $400 million voluntary trust fund that has attracted relatively small sums from a few of the organization\u2019s 192 member states.  A voluntary trust fund is among the possibilities for aiding the Roma, but the amount envisioned is in the $10 million range, people knowledgeable about the process said. The delay in redressing the Roma poisoning is the latest in a slowly moving process that began after the human rights panel delivered its opinion in February 2016, when Ban Ki-moon was the secretary general. In December, with just a few weeks before their terms ended, Mr. Ban\u2019s deputy secretary general, Jan Eliasson, convened a meeting about the panel\u2019s findings, according to people knowledgeable about it. Mr. Eliasson did not respond to a request for comment. The outcome was the draft apology statement made in the name of the top Unmik official, Zahir Tanin, the secretary general\u2019s special representative in Kosovo. The Office of Legal Affairs, which did not object to the idea of an apology at the December meeting, apparently changed its view when the draft was circulated a few months later. At a higher-level meeting convened in March by Mr. Guterres, the Office of Legal Affairs recommended against the apology language, people knowledgeable about it said. The United Nations deliberations over how to deal with the Roma poisoning have frustrated human rights advocates and the victims\u2019 lawyers, who have pressed the organization for years to take responsibility. \u201cThe victims of lead poisoning in Unmik camps in northern Kosovo have waited far too long for a public apology and compensation from the U.N., which was directly responsible for their suffering,\u201d Louis Charbonneau, the United Nations director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. The advisory panel found that Unmik had failed to protect Roma families uprooted from their homes and moved into three camps in the north part of Mitrovica, Kosovo, after war broke out in 1998 between Serbia and ethnic Albanian separatists. All the camps were within 200 yards of industrial waste from a lead-smelting factory. Although the United Nations realized the families were living on toxic land and health specialists urged their relocation, nothing was done to move the residents for years, even as many \u2014 especially older people, expectant mothers and children \u2014 were sickened by lead-contaminated soil and dust. \u201cYou could smell the toxicity in the air, smell it in the ground,\u201d said Paul Polansky, an American expert on the Roma who alerted United Nations officials in Kosovo to the problem in 1999. Mr. Polansky, an activist who helped produce a 2005 documentary about the lead poisoning, \u201cGypsy Blood,\u201d said in a telephone interview that he was not surprised at the United Nations\u2019 lack of actions. \u201cI expect them to do absolutely nothing,\u201d he said. Naim Mehmeti, 50, a scrap-metal collector whose family had lived in one of the camps, Zitkovac, said one of his daughters had died from lead poisoning before she was five. Another, now 13, has severely impaired vision from lead contamination. \u201cNobody even knew what lead was,\u201d Mr. Mehmeti said in a Skype interview from Kosovo. He was not optimistic about the possibility of compensation. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting much, not even an apology, because this is how the institutions work in Kosovo,\u201d he said. Dianne Post, a lawyer who represents some Roma victims, was also dismissive. Shown a copy of the draft apology statement, she observed that its reference to Kosovo\u2019s \u201cunique circumstances\u201d implied that the United Nations regarded the poisoning as an exceptional event. \u201cFactually it may be, but legally it is not \u2014 witness Haiti,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course they want to use \u2018unique\u2019 to avoid setting precedent for such violations.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/world/europe/roma-gypsies-lead-poisoning-un.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T19:03:59-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Roma Sickened in U.N.
