{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Federal prosecutors have yet to capture or convict the foreign computer criminals believed to be behind the hackings of big retailers like Target and Neiman Marcus. But in a rare case playing out in Federal District Court in Seattle, the Department of Justice netted a big player in a Russian digital crime ring who is the son of a prominent Russian lawmaker. And now law enforcement officials have made an example of him. On Friday, a judge sentenced Roman Seleznev, 32, to 27 years in prison \u2014 the longest prison sentence handed down for hacking-related charges in the United States \u2014 for running a huge credit card and identity theft operation from his various homes in Bali, Indonesia and Vladivostok, Russia, and selling millions of credit card numbers on the black market. Federal prosecutors asked for a 30-year sentence. Mr. Seleznev\u2019s schemes led to the theft and resale of more than two million credit card numbers, resulting in losses of at least $170 million. The total could expand into the billions, according to court documents. Among Mr. Seleznev\u2019s victims were 3,700 financial institutions and 500 businesses around the world, including several restaurants in the Seattle area. \u201cSimply put, Roman Seleznev has harmed more victims and caused more financial loss than perhaps any other defendant that has appeared before the court,\u201d federal prosecutors said in their sentencing memorandum. \u201cThis prosecution is unprecedented.\u201d For years, law enforcement in the United States has faced challenges in capturing and convicting Russians accused of hacking. Russian cybercriminals operate with relative impunity inside Russia as long as they do not hack targets in their country. In return for their immunity, cybercriminals are often tapped to work for Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies. It is only when Russian computer criminals have traveled outside Russia that United States law enforcement has detained them, most recently in Prague and in Barcelona. But law enforcement officials say more than three dozen overseas hackers suspected in crimes remain beyond their reach. The United States Secret Service, which handles financial fraud cases, tracked Mr. Seleznev for more than a decade, according to court filings. But he was careful not to go to a country that had an extradition treaty with the United States. The Secret Service caught a break in June 2014, when investigators learned that Mr. Seleznev planned a vacation to the Maldives with his girlfriend. The State Department persuaded Maldivian police to assist, although the country does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. A month later, Mr. Seleznev was arrested at the Maldives airport by local police. He was handed over to Secret Service agents and taken by private jet to the United States territory of Guam, and from there to a federal prison in Washington. Investigators seized evidence from Mr. Seleznev\u2019s computers of his various hacking and carding schemes. They also found photos of Mr. Seleznev driving flashy sports cars and vacationing in tropical locations, and photos of stacks upon stacks of what appeared to be 5,000-ruble bills. Mr. Seleznev is the son of Valery Seleznev, an outspoken member of the Duma, or Russian parliament, and a close political ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The elder Seleznev has accused the United States of \u201ckidnapping\u201d his son, and he told a Russian news outlet that the charges against him were a \u201cmonstrous lie.\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign affairs ministry has lashed out at Maldivian authorities for cooperating with the United States in what it, too, has described as a \u201ckidnapping.\u201d At trial, prosecutors successfully argued that Mr. Seleznev had run one of the largest credit card and online identity theft rings, under various aliases, including Track2, 2pac and nCuX \u2014 a translation of the Russian word for \u201cpsycho.\u201d Given the large number of victims and financial losses, federal sentencing guidelines indicated that Mr. Seleznev should be given a life sentence, but prosecutors recommended the 30-year sentence. The 27-year sentence handed down Friday is expected to send a message to other Russian computer criminals. \u201cThis is a huge success in that there are significant challenges to indicting Russian cybercriminals,\u201d said Levi Gundert, a former Secret Service agent who now works as vice president of intelligence at Recorded Future, a cybersecurity firm. In an 11-page handwritten letter submitted to the federal court this year, Mr. Seleznev admitted to, and apologized for, his crimes. \u201cI am alive today and I thank God and the United States of America government,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was going down a very deadly road before my arrest.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/technology/russian-hacker-sentenced.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T14:17:01-04:00", "abstract": "Prosecutors in the United States rarely manage to convict let alone arrest foreign hackers.
