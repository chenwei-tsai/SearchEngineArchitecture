The decision by Justice Denise A. Hartman of State Supreme Court involved an investigation by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics into whether the nonprofit, the Campaign for One New York, violated state regulations by failing to register in 2015 as a lobbyist. The two parties argued their positions in court in July, the first public court battle to emerge from various state and federal investigations into the mayor\u2019s fund-raising and political activities. The ruling, issued last week but not received by the parties until Monday, comes as Mr. de Blasio is also fighting in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to keep emails and text messages between City Hall and a small number of outside advisers \u2014 some of whom played central roles in the political nonprofit before it closed down this year \u2014 from being disclosed to reporters. \u201cWe disagree with the judge\u2019s final judgment, and so we\u2019re exploring appellate options at this point,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told reporters on Monday. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s lawyers cooperated with the investigation for months, turning over documents in an effort to show that although the nonprofit had registered as a lobbyist in 2014, it had conducted no lobbying during 2015 and therefore did not register that year. But after the state panel issued a second subpoena in May, the nonprofit\u2019s lawyers decided to stop cooperating, arguing that it had gone beyond the panel\u2019s jurisdiction. That second subpoena sought a broad range of information, including expenses, agendas and correspondence that related to donations received by the nonprofit. Its lawyers also withheld some documents \u2014 meetings and communications between the Campaign for One New York and the mayor\u2019s office \u2014 requested by the state panel, known as Jcope, in its first subpoena, citing various exemptions to disclosure, including attorney-client privilege and trade secrets. Justice Hartman, at one point, accused the nonprofit\u2019s lawyers of circular reasoning, writing that the Campaign for One New York \u201cinsists that, because it asserts that it did not lobby the mayor but only advised him, Jcope is precluded from obtaining communications between the mayor and the campaign.\u201d \u201cBut having laid a proper foundation,\u201d she continued, \u201cJcope is entitled to review them and make its own determination.\u201d Laurence Laufer, a lawyer for the nonprofit, said that while they were reviewing the decision, \u201cJcope has not conducted this investigation in good faith,\u201d and that no evidence of lobbying by the nonprofit had been provided. The panel, Mr. Laufer said, \u201cshould conclude this politicized investigation.\u201d Some of Mr. Laufer\u2019s own communications, including notes on a phone call, were withheld under attorney-client privilege. The judge ordered those documents turned over and, more broadly, said the investigation and its most recent subpoena were not harassment or a fishing expedition, but rather \u201cstood on firm factual ground.\u201d \u201cThe mayor is a public official,\u201d Justice Hartman wrote. \u201cAny attempt by Campaign to influence the mayor may have constituted lobbying.\u201d Daniel J. Horwitz, the chairman of the state ethics panel, said in a statement that the panel was \u201cpleased with the decision\u201d and \u201cwill continue to robustly enforce the law.\u201d The court hearing, originally closed to the public but opened after a motion by The New York Times, culminated a bitter and public feud between the state panel and the nonprofit\u2019s lawyers, who suggested the inquiry had been motivated by a political desire to hurt the mayor on the part of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat. The state panel has denied any political motivation behind its investigation. The nonprofit \u201chas not demonstrated that any of the subpoenaed documents are privileged or otherwise exempt from disclosure,\u201d Justice Hartman wrote, with the exception of documents from 2013 \u2014 which she said were not relevant to the inquiry \u2014 and four other documents that might be covered by attorney-client privilege. She ordered those documents to be turned over for review by the court to see if the privilege applies.", "item_type": "Article"}
