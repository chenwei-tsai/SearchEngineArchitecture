In doing so, the authorities have said, they may have defused a second bomb. The two men simply liked the bag they happened upon, according to officials for EgyptAir, where the men, who were visiting New York, worked as in-flight security guards. \u201cYou know, we see things left on the street in New York all the time,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cStuff no one wants. It\u2019s normal to take them.\u201d The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to publicly discuss the matter. Indeed, there is little unusual here about what the men, identified as Hassan Ali and Abou Bakr Radwan by the airline officials, did with the bag. New Yorkers have long scooped up finds off the pavement. The streets have given Wendy Blake a Persian lamb jacket, a cat-scratching post and, recently, a \u201cperfectly good salad bowl\u201d from Ikea. \u201cFree stuff, there is something really compelling about it,\u201d said Ms. Blake, a writer who lived and hunted for free goods in Brooklyn for 30 years before moving upstate. \u201cMaybe because the city is so expensive.\u201d The bag containing the pressure cooker may have been a Louis Vuitton knockoff, officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation have said. \u201cI get it,\u201d Ms. Blake said. For legions of New Yorkers, items on the curb \u2014 furniture, paintings, appliances and bags \u2014 have long seemed fair game. Yet those items should be left to trash carters like the Sanitation Department, according to the city\u2019s administrative code. This, plus the dicey situation into which the two EgyptAir employees unwittingly stepped, should make people think twice about taking trash, said City Councilman Antonio Reynoso, who is chairman of the committee on sanitation and solid waste management. \u201cWe might have gotten lucky here, as it seems that the actions could have assisted in disarming the bomb,\u201d Mr. Reynoso said on Sunday. \u201cBut this just further strengthens the case not to take anything off the sidewalk.\u201d Moonmoon Parmar, an environmental planner from Astoria, Queens, has left things outside in the past, hoping that someone would take them. She still would, she said: When she spotted a woman walking off with her discarded black handbag, she was pleased. \u201cIt was better than it going in the trash,\u201d she said. The practice is pervasive, said Susan Strasser, the author of \u201cWaste and Want: A Social History of Trash.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of the ways that stuff moves through urban spaces, that people discard things and other people pick them up,\u201d she said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a can that someone might collect, or whether it\u2019s something large \u2014 like a suitcase sitting there abandoned.\u201d Before the two men found the bag on West 27th Street, a bomb that was placed under a Dumpster on West 23rd Street exploded and injured 31 people. Ahmad Khan Rahami was arrested in Linden, N.J., two days later and charged with multiple crimes, including using weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Rahami has also been linked to an explosion in Seaside Park, N.J., and to a backpack containing pipe bombs found at a train station in Elizabeth, N.J. In Elizabeth, two men pulled from the trash a backpack that they wanted to keep, the authorities said. When they saw what appeared to be explosives, they notified the police. \u201cIf people want to pick up items that are clearly discarded in public, that is up to them to decide,\u201d Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department, said in an email. If anything seems suspicious, the police should immediately be summoned, she added. New Yorkers said they hunted for treasure in the trash for reasons ranging from economic to just plain fun. Jeremy Bastien, a maintenance worker who lives in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, enjoys being able to repair computer parts other people throw away. Julia Berick, who works in publishing and lives in the East Village in Manhattan, said it just seemed an inevitable part of urban life. \u201cIn an anonymous city, it seems like everything could be up for grabs,\u201d she said.", "item_type": "Article"}
