{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014  Under fierce attack from the political right, and with even some Democrats questioning its competence, the Environmental Protection Agency is facing a tumultuous election year \u2014 with rising regulatory responsibilities, falling budgets and its very existence at stake. The agency has long been a favorite political target for Republicans, who criticize its authority to regulate large areas of the American economy as it enacts rules to curb pollution. But the E.P.A.\u2019s challenges in 2016 are multifaceted. The Democratic presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have questioned the agency\u2019s handling of the drinking water crisis in Flint, Mich. And a toxic wastewater spill in a Colorado river last year brought charges of incompetence from both parties. The leading Republican presidential hopefuls, Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz, have each vowed to eviscerate the agency. \u201cWe are going to get rid of it in almost every form,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a debate this month. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have little tidbits left, but we\u2019re going to take a tremendous amount out.\u201d Mr. Cruz, at the same debate, added, \u201cI will pull back the federal regulators, the E.P.A. and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.\u201d And House Republicans, at a hearing Thursday on the Flint water crisis, called for the E.P.A.\u2019s administrator to resign. Republican policy experts are already talking about how to translate such talking points into concrete elements of the party\u2019s policy platform, to be unveiled this summer at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. While many policy experts are dismissive of Mr. Trump himself, the candidate\u2019s views on a sharply limited federal role in environmental protection align with specific ideas that some conservatives have pushed for years. No matter who emerges as the Republican nominee, the party\u2019s official policy will almost certainly take aim at the size, scope and structure of the E.P.A. Conservative policy makers are considering proposals that would effectively strip the agency of its authority to set, put in place and enforce pollution standards. The agency would continue to exist, at least in name, but it could end up functioning only as a small scientific research agency, possibly swallowed into another department. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to have the agency in its current form,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who has played a central role in drafting the party\u2019s environmental policy platform in previous presidential campaigns. \u201cSomething\u2019s going to be in the platform that gives the E.P.A. a serious haircut.\u201d Democratic candidates are not exactly rushing to the agency\u2019s defense. Mrs. Clinton said that as president she would open an investigation into its handling of the Flint water crisis. Mr. Sanders said that he would \u201cfire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately.\u201d At Thursday\u2019s hearing, Representative Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois and a highly regarded Senate candidate, said she was \u201cextremely troubled by how the E.P.A. also failed in its duty to serve as the last line of defense for the children of Flint.\u201d The agency\u2019s responsibilities have never been greater, and its resources have never been so strained. Created in 1970 by President Richard M. Nixon, the E.P.A. is charged with writing, carrying out and enforcing regulations under existing laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Its rules impose restrictions on business, industry and agriculture, limiting the amount and types of pollutants that can be emitted into the air and water, as well as where and how landowners can use their property. The regulations can sometimes impose billions of dollars of costs on industry, requiring companies to install expensive pollution control technology and in some cases to shut down polluting facilities. But President Obama\u2019s effort to combat global warming has transformed that mandate. The president\u2019s climate policies require regulations so sweeping that the E.P.A. has essentially been tasked with transforming major sectors of the American economy, including the auto industry and the electric power sector, over the next decade. Because those global warming regulations have been issued under the legal authority of an existing law, the Clean Air Act, it could be difficult for a Republican president to simply repeal them outright. But substantially weakening the agency that enacts the rules could effectively hamstring Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change legacy. Historically, environmental regulations have required polluters to install new equipment like so-called smokestack scrubbers and catalytic converters in cars, factories and power plants. But Mr. Obama\u2019s current suite of climate change regulations, if enacted, would go far beyond that. The E.P.A. would effectively change how automobiles are propelled (with electricity, not gasoline) and how electricity is delivered (via wind and solar, not coal), said Bob Persciacepe, the agency\u2019s deputy administrator during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cWe are at a pivotal moment in time, when, in fits and starts, the world is dealing with climate change and every country has to play an important role,\u201d he said. \u201cE.P.A. has been put in the spot to do this. The weight on their shoulders is heavy.\u201d All of this is supposed to be accomplished under tight budgets imposed by a hostile Congress. The agency\u2019s spending under Mr. Obama has been cut between 10 and 20 percent below the budgets of the previous three administrations, when adjusted for inflation. The agency\u2019s budget has averaged about $8.8 billion annually under Mr. Obama, compared with (in today\u2019s dollars) $9.7 billion under George W. Bush, $10.6 billion under Bill Clinton and $10.4 billion under George Bush. The agency\u2019s 15,408 employees are its fewest since 1989. As the E.P.A. has taken on more work with fewer resources, problems have proliferated. Last year, after the E.P.A. accidentally spilled three million gallons of toxic wastewater from an abandoned mine into the Animas River in Colorado, a government report found that the agency lacked the technical skills to handle such tricky projects. The agency has also been criticized for its implementation of a regulation known as \u201cWaters of the U.S.,\u201d which would expand pollution controls over the nation\u2019s rivers and streams. \u201cIt\u2019s clear E.P.A. cannot currently handle the issues on its plate,\u201d Representative Scott DesJarlais, Republican of Tennessee, said Thursday. A spokeswoman for the E.P.A. declined to comment on the politics swirling around the agency. But Obama administration officials noted that the E.P.A. still enjoyed public support. A Pew poll in September 2015 found that 52 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the agency. That support could make it more difficult for a Republican president to enact some of the most drastic changes envisioned by those drafting the party\u2019s policy platform, because at least some proposals would have to go before Congress. And eliminating the E.P.A. would not eliminate the government\u2019s legal obligations to carry out regulations under existing laws. \u201cI\u2019m a very conservative guy, and there are legitimate criticisms of E.P.A., and there has been E.P.A. overreach,\u201d said Jeffrey Holmstead, a former deputy administrator of the agency under George W. Bush. But, he noted, under the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, the E.P.A. is required to supply operating permits to industrial plants and manufacturers. \u201cEven if E.P.A. disappeared tomorrow, the regulations would still have the force of law,\u201d Mr. Holmstead said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/us/politics/epa-faces-bigger-tasks-smaller-budgets-and-louder-critics.html", "published_date": "2016-03-17T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:11-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:11-04:00", "abstract": "Under attack by both parties, the agency is facing a tumultuous election year, with more work, fewer resources and its very existence at stake.", "title": "E.P.A.
