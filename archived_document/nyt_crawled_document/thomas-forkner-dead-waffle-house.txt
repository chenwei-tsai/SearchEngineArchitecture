{"text": "Thomas Forkner, a founder of Waffle House, the family restaurant chain known for its hearty food, friendly staff and perpetual business hours, died on Wednesday in Suwanee, Ga. He was 98. His son, Tom Jr., confirmed the death. Joseph W. Rogers, who founded Waffle House with Mr. Forkner, died in March. Mr. Forkner first encountered Mr. Rogers in 1949, when Mr. Forkner, who was working in real estate then, sold him a house near his own in Avondale Estates, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. Mr. Rogers, who worked in a restaurant chain, and Mr. Forkner became friends and then business partners when they opened the first Waffle House in Avondale Estates in 1955. Both men kept their day jobs during those early years, but the business developed a loyal following and quickly expanded. By the early 1960s, they were engaged in Waffle House full time. The chain became a popular cultural touchstone known for its welcoming atmosphere; its ample menu of roadside staples like hash browns, eggs, steaks and waffles; and its all-day, everyday service. Overnight traffic was crucial to Waffle House\u2019s success, Mr. Forkner said, and he and Mr. Rogers tried to maximize it. \u201cOne supreme test of whether it\u2019s a good location \u2014 take a real rainy, blistery Tuesday or Wednesday night at two o\u2019clock in the morning, park your automobile there, and see how many cars pass,\u201d he told Atlanta magazine in 2007. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have many cars, you don\u2019t have a good spot.\u201d The restaurants are so reliably open that W. Craig Fugate, the leader of the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Obama administration, said that he had applied a \u201cWaffle House Test\u201d for determining the severity of a natural disaster. \u201cIf a Waffle House is closed because there\u2019s a disaster, it\u2019s bad,\u201d Mr. Fugate joked in 2016 on \u201cWait, Wait ... Don\u2019t Tell Me!,\u201d NPR\u2019s comedy quiz show. \u201cWe call it red. If they\u2019re open but have a limited menu, that\u2019s yellow.\u201d Today there are 1,859 Waffle Houses in 25 states, mainly in the Southeast. The company is privately held and does not release financial data, but Technomic, a restaurant industry consulting and research company, estimated that Waffle House had more than $1 billion in sales in 2015. Mr. Forkner stepped out of his full-time job at Waffle House in the late 1970s, but remained a prominent figure in the company. A spokesman for Waffle House said Mr. Forkner had kept an office at the company headquarters in Norcross, Ga., and drove himself there until a few months ago. Thomas Francis Forkner Sr. was born in Hawkinsville, Ga., on June 14, 1918, to Benjamin Forkner and the former Bessie Allison. His father oversaw the building of Avondale Estates and started the Forkner Realty Company. Mr. Forkner graduated from Young Harris College in Georgia and earned a law degree in Atlanta from the Woodrow Wilson College of Law, which has since closed, before he was drafted into the Army in 1941. During the war, he was a counterintelligence agent and worked on the Manhattan Project, helping to transfer sensitive material in the making of atomic bombs from Oak Ridge, Tenn., to Los Alamos, N.M. He met Martha Bishop while at Oak Ridge, and they married a few months later on Sept. 20, 1945. She died in March. After the war, Mr. Forkner took over the family real estate business. After leaving his full-time position at Waffle House, he devoted time to real estate and golf. He was named one of Golf Digest\u2019s top 10 senior players four times and was inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame in 2007. In addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters, Marti Forkner-Vernon and Allison Forkner; five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/thomas-forkner-dead-waffle-house.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T20:01:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "created_date": "2017-04-28T20:01:16-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Forkner met his future business partner, Joseph W.
