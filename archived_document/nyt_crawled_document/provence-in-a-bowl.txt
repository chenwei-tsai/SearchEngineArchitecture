{"text": "Jessica B. Harris stepped out of her pink cottage in New Orleans and into the sun. She took the stairs carefully, in gold boat shoes, her shoulders draped in flowing fabric, a Zuni necklace of tiny multicolored animals swaying around her neck. \u201cBeing a little old lady is less than advertised,\u201d she said. But Harris, who is 69, is not really a little old lady. She\u2019s a professor of English at Queens College who spring-breaks in New Orleans; a culinary historian and a witty, in-demand lecturer; and the author of a dozen cookbooks on the foods of the African diaspora. For years, her work has shaped my understanding of American cuisine, and I was so nervous to meet her that I practiced introducing myself just before I pulled up to her home. Good morning, Dr. Harris? Oh-my-God-hi! Harris\u2019s new book, \u201cMy Soul Looks Back,\u201d out next month, is her first memoir. Its focus is New York in the 1970s and early \u201980s, when Harris lived in the West Village and her social circle included some of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century \u2014 James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, Paule Marshall and Toni Morrison. Harris was a successful teacher and journalist, a rising star, but in her early days, among so much glamour, she felt like an outsider. For two days in Abidjan, on the Ivory Coast, she found herself both frenemy and fixer to Nina Simone. In Saint Paul-de-Vence, in the South of France, Harris spent a week at Baldwin\u2019s home, where he read to her, out loud, from start to finish, an early draft of his novel \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk.\u201d That week, Harris ate lamb and baked tomatoes, ratatouille and boeuf en daube. Outside, by the cypress trees in Baldwin\u2019s garden, under clear blue skies, she ate soupe au pistou. The Proven\u00e7al soup was simple: vegetables cut bite-size, simmered in broth, cheered up with plenty of garlicky pesto, dropped directly into each bowl. \u201cYou should know, I\u2019m pretty much incapable of following a recipe, including my own,\u201d Harris said as we leaned over her recipe for her book. She wrote the recipe for the memoir using a mix of research and memory, but she\u2019d cook it the way she liked to cook, in the moment, following her own senses, not a list. Soupe au pistou is well suited to Harris\u2019s spontaneous, unfussy approach to cooking. It\u2019s country food, adjusted endlessly to make use of whatever\u2019s around, easily doubled to feed a crowd. Traditionally it was a summer dish. You made it when the basil came up. Now basil is everywhere, all the time. Make soupe au pistou in the spring, go on through the summer and week to week your pot can still show you how time passes, from fresh favas and summer squash to corn and green beans. At the Crescent City Farmers Market, Harris took her time, looping the stalls before settling on what to buy, then reaching for pretty much everything that looked good. This included fat white turnips (which she referred to all day as \u201cthe turnips that devoured Cleveland\u201d), snap peas, yellow summer squash and tiny, thin-skinned red potatoes. She picked up a few pints of local blueberries to have for dessert with whipped cream sweetened with cane syrup, and a loaf of bread for the platter of cheese she planned to put out before dessert. \u201cI never met a stinky, runny cheese I didn\u2019t love,\u201d she said. Back in Harris\u2019s kitchen, which gleamed with vintage copper, I was on chopping duty, peeling and slicing vegetables on a dollhouse cutting board the size of my hand. Harris put Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora on the speakers in the next room and opened a bottle of her favorite ros\u00e9. \u201cYou good?\u201d she asked, if she noticed me hesitate. \u201cPhooey,\u201d she said, if something wasn\u2019t right. Harris sweated carrots and leeks in a tall copper pot. The sweet white turnips went in, along with their greens, and Harris got to work setting a table in her living room. \u201cI\u2019m a social cook,\u201d she said, moving books out of the way to make room for a pink tablecloth and antique glasses. At the market, earlier, she reached for her phone, in its Tweety Bird case, and called some friends over. \u201cI know it\u2019s last minute, but I\u2019ve got a wonderful surprise,\u201d she told them. \u201cI\u2019m making a soupe au pistou.\u201d By 7, friends were at her door, with gifts of homemade lemon curd and cold wine and a handful of gardenias. Harris added pasta and squash to the pot and let it bubble while she caught up with them. Off the heat, she stirred in a big spoonful of pesto, and the broth turned a beautiful bright green. Harris took a seat at the head of the table, surrounded by friends, and raised a glass.
