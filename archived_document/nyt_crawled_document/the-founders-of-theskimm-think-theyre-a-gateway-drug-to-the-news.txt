Its tagline is \u201ctheSkimm makes it easier to be smarter.\u201d What does that mean? ZAKIN: We didn\u2019t create theSkimm for lack of intelligence or lack of interest in the news. What we figured out was a way to make it easier for our readers to understand the world around them in a way that they enjoyed hearing about and in a way that made it easy to remember. A recent newsletter used \u201cwhen you and your friend both thought the other was making dinner reservations\u201d as a way to introduce the confusion over a U.S. aircraft carrier that was supposed to be headed to North Korea. Why does the newsletter have the tone it does? WEISBERG: We sound like people actually speak. We spent a lot of time developing the character of the Skimm Girl. When we bring people onto our team, no matter if they\u2019re an engineer or on products, we talk about who this character is, and what she would order at brunch, or what her favorite drink is. What is her favorite drink? ZAKIN: A jalape\u00f1o margarita. Do you think the chatty aspect trivializes the news? ZAKIN: You don\u2019t get topics that have more gravity than the ones we\u2019re talking about now, and the fact that people still read the news and enjoy the experience says a lot about the community we\u2019ve created. Do you think digests make people feel more informed than they actually are? WEISBERG: We would love it if everyone was as obsessed with the news as we are, but that\u2019s not the reality, and it never will be. We\u2019re proud to be a gateway drug. Why have you remained nonpartisan? ZAKIN: We didn\u2019t feel it was our place to endorse a candidate. We pushed our audience to make sure that they were informed, but we wanted them to make their own opinion. Last year, we worked with Rock the Vote and got over 110,000 people registered to vote, 95,000 of which were women. That\u2019s something we\u2019re hugely proud of: that this audience isn\u2019t just reading us every day, but they\u2019re also taking some sort of action. But what does that action mean if it\u2019s not in a direction you find politically productive? WEISBERG: It means you are making an effort to get outside your bubble and learn more about your place in the world. How do you decide what to cover? ZAKIN: Our goal is that anyone who goes to any work or social event can talk to anybody about anything. We\u2019re not putting a value proposition on what stories you should care about most, but what we are saying is that this is the stuff you\u2019re going to hear about. WEISBERG: I think the other way that editorial filter really comes into play is the way we work with brands. That part of our business is driven by native advertising, so we work with brands that we feel can connect with our audience. Ultimately, we think about ourselves as storytellers, whether it\u2019s telling the news of the day, telling the company story or telling the brand story. You started your careers in news at NBC. Do you have any discomfort about working with brands from that? WEISBERG: Considering ourselves journalists doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t consider ourselves businesswomen. Considering the chattiness of your tone, are you conscious of the need to negotiate gender stereotypes? WEISBERG: Well, as businesswomen who quit our jobs to start a company from a couch and have raised through Series B venture funding and employ 40 people, Carly and I are certainly doing a lot for the narrative of female entrepreneurship. ZAKIN: If we can empower people to feel more comfortable talking about Syria while they\u2019re having a glass of sauvignon blanc, then we\u2019re happy to celebrate that.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/magazine/the-founders-of-theskimm-think-theyre-a-gateway-drug-to-the-news.html", "material_type_facet": "News", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:09-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "title": "The Founders of theSkimm Think They\u2019re a Gateway Drug to the News", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:09-04:00"}
