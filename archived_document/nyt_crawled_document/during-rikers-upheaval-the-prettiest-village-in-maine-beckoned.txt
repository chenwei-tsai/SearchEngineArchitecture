{"text": "WISCASSET, Me. \u2014 The trip, even in the best of conditions, is one that will eat up at least a quarter of a day. It starts with creeping through traffic heading out of New York City and soon gives way to a tour of New England. One route touches five states, skirting bigger cities and cutting through smaller ones, but mostly the journey is spent cruising along on six-lane highways, whipping past a blur of trees. Investigators found that Joseph Ponte, the correction commissioner in New York City, had repeatedly taken his city-issued sport-utility vehicle on trips that ended here, a small town near the Maine coast with streets dotted with colonial homes and a blink-and-you-will-miss-it downtown that is nonetheless something of a draw. An inquiry by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation into the personal use of Correction Department vehicles found that they had been driven off to outlet malls and the Hamptons and, in the case of Mr. Ponte, to Maine, where he lived before coming to New York in 2014. Tracking the vehicle\u2019s movements through GPS, E-ZPass data and records on gasoline purchases, along with other information, investigators found that Mr. Ponte had spent 90 days last year outside of New York, including 35 during the workweek. Among the destinations, officials said, was Wiscasset, a town of more than 3,000 people reached after long rides on winding country roads and marked with a welcome sign that declares it the \u201cPrettiest Village in Maine.\u201d Mr. Ponte and his wife had, until recently, owned a home here, and he has adult children living in the state. Officials said he had also visited nearby resorts. The working-class town, sitting along the Sheepscot River, has an economy driven in large part by tourism; antiques dealers, art galleries and boutiques dominate the few blocks that constitute downtown, and Red\u2019s Eats, a small food stand, overshadows them all with its ability to draw a crowd as noteworthy as its lobster rolls. Some around Wiscasset said they had recognized Mr. Ponte or had encountered him or his wife around town. But many said people here tended to place a premium on independence, treasuring a kind of live-and-let-live attitude in which neighbors are friendly but also allow for a bit of space. \u201cEveryone just leaves you alone,\u201d said Deb Schaffer, who owns a boutique downtown and remembers seeing Mr. Ponte and exchanging greetings on the street. \u201cBut if you need something, they\u2019re there to help.\u201d Mr. Ponte does not appear to have left much of an impression on his neighbors around Wiscasset. But he had built a reputation for driving reforms in the prison as the commissioner of the state\u2019s Department of Corrections, gaining the support of prisoner rights advocates and others who praised him for being accessible and hard-working. His work in Maine led him to be recruited by Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2014 in an effort to overhaul the Correction Department in New York. During his time as commissioner, the agency has had some successes, including expanding education and therapeutic programs and ending solitary confinement for inmates younger than 22. But the report on the Department of Investigation\u2019s inquiry, which was released last week, reprimanded Mr. Ponte for the misuse of his city vehicle on trips that led to frequent absences during a time of upheaval at the Rikers Island jail complex. The mayor has defended Mr. Ponte, saying that he maintained his faith in the commissioner and that Mr. Ponte had been acting on incorrect guidance. Officials said he had put about 18,500 miles of out-of-state travel on the vehicle, costing less than $1,800 in gas and tolls. Officials and investigators declined to elaborate on where he had gone on those trips, and it is unclear how he spent his time in Maine. Mr. Ponte and his wife had owned a home in Wiscasset about a mile from downtown, a gray house perched on a hill at the end of a short road, with a wraparound porch offering a sweeping view of the river and a panorama of trees. It is about a half-hour drive to the State Department of Corrections headquarters in Augusta. The house, built in 1993, was sold in March and had been listed for $299,000; the new owner, Vince Pepe, said he and his wife had paid close to the asking price. Mr. Pepe, an artist, said the home is 2,600 square feet; was outfitted with its own sauna and workout room; and came with 13 acres of property, with a red barn near the house. Some neighbors in an apartment complex downhill from the Pontes\u2019 former home said that they had seen Mr. Ponte and his wife on occasional visits in the past, and that before the house had been on the market, the Pontes\u2019 daughter had been living there. R. Keith Rendall, an artist who lives down the street, said he had never seen much happening at the home and had assumed it was part of the apartment complex. Wiscasset has had its share of struggles over the years, particularly the closing of the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in 1996. The backbone of the community are the year-round residents \u2014 the \u201coil to the engine,\u201d as Dana Browne, a manager of Treats, a bakery and shop, put it. Many residents who found their way here are described as \u201cfrom away,\u201d a term heard often \u2014 and embroidered on a pillow for sale in one of the shops and even adapted to fit on a vanity license plate. These days, ahead of the busy season, there is no line at Red\u2019s, and in the parking lot by the yacht club, there were only a couple sitting in their truck, reading the paper and eating sandwiches on their \u201cdate night.\u201d The issue driving much of the town\u2019s conversations was hotly debated plans to alter Route 1, the main street through downtown, and add traffic lights. Even when things pick up, the draw of the area remains the same: It serves as a \u201csanctuary\u201d for many who come and appreciate the stunning vistas that surround them, said Matthew Robinson, an antiques dealer who has a shop in an old bank across from Red\u2019s. Visitors here try not to gain notice, and residents often list the names of the celebrities they have come across but have not gawked at. \u201cIt\u2019s not a place like the Hamptons,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way people sort of want it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t aspire to have a society.\u201d Across the street, as she worked in her shop, Ms. Schaffer said the area had an undeniable appeal, one that she remembered from visits as a child and that led her move here two decades ago. \u201cMy soul\u2019s at peace here,\u201d she said. Lynn Murray, who works with Ms. Schaffer, agreed. She had come to Maine for work years ago, then left for Montana only to miss the trees and water, and she quickly sought a way back. \u201cOur way of life,\u201d she said, \u201cis the best way of life.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/nyregion/during-rikers-upheaval-the-prettiest-village-in-maine-beckoned.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T18:14:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T18:14:10-04:00", "abstract": "Wiscasset, the former home of New York City\u2019s correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, was a frequent destination in his city-issued vehicle, investigators found.", "title": "During Rikers Upheaval, the \u2018Prettiest Village in Maine\u2019 Beckoned"}
