{"text": "DENTON, Tex. \u2014 On the morning of the 20th annual African Cultural Festival at the University of North Texas here, Torgbui Midawo Gideon Foli Alorwoyie, the festival\u2019s founder, was doing last-minute errands. There were drums to gather, programs to pick up from the printer, costumes to procure. For these annual events, he is his own promoter, his own publicist, his own street team. \u201cI do everything myself,\u201d he explained from the driver\u2019s seat of his minivan. Deep blue scars on his cheeks \u2014 marking him as a Midawo, or high priest, of the Ewe cult of Ghana\u2019s Volta region \u2014 bent as he glanced between two different cellphones. A thick chain with a gold medallion in the shape of Africa glinted on his chest. Mr. Alorwoyie (pronounced al-or-WO-yee), 71, is a rarity in American academia: a master drummer from Africa who is a tenured professor of African drumming and dance, disciplines that are difficult to categorize within Western musical theory. And in his own country, he is one of the few musicians working arduously to pass on traditions in danger of disappearing. Mr. Alorwoyie also carries the title of Torgbui, or paramount chief, in his region of Ghana, responsible for administrative decisions and rulings on certain judgments; an herbalist (a large bottle of gin at his home, stuffed with long roots, was repeatedly offered to a visitor for its healing properties); and a stern taskmaster to his performers and students. He has a key link to the evolution of American Minimalism: In 1970, the composer Steve Reich traveled to Ghana and studied with Mr. Alorwoyie for a month. \u201cDrumming,\u201d Mr. Reich\u2019s groundbreaking piece for nine percussionists, was written after his trip. At several rehearsals on the University of North Texas campus earlier this month, Mr. Alorwoyie guided a student drumming and dance ensemble that, for the festival concert, would be accompanied by five Ghanaian percussionists as well as Mr. Alorwoyie\u2019s wife, Memunatu, 46, a former principal dancer in the Ghana Dance Ensemble in Accra; several former students who regularly return to dance at his events; and their daughter, Gloria, 11, who has been under her mother\u2019s tutelage since birth. Lither and quicker than many men half his age, Mr. Alorwoyie exuded a fierce calm during rehearsals. For many rhythms, he stood next to the atsimevu, a massive drum played with sticks. Tapping against its hull to establish a beat, Mr. Alorwoyie called drummers and dancers into action, activating changes in the patterns and movements with nods or shifts in expression. When not playing, he paced like a general, hands on his hips. Some Ewe rhythms have a slippery, collapsing quality, an amorphous relationship to any easily recognizable downbeat. Mr. Alorwoyie\u2019s lead patterns directed the dancers, but when another drummer took over the atsimevu, Mr. Alorwoyie stepped into a dance with his wife; their playful steps around each other were like marital shadowboxing. As complex as the rhythmic patterns are, they go hand-in-hand with movement and song \u2014 the dancers and drummers serve one another. \u201cAfrican music is not something you just listen to,\u201d Mr. Alorwoyie said in an interview in his office, its walls covered in awards, degrees and newspaper articles about him dating back decades. \u201cThe answer is the dance.\u201d Mr. Alorwoyie left Ghana in 1976 and took a position as a visiting lecturer at SUNY College at Brockport. After stints at the American Conservatory of Music and the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, he joined the North Texas faculty in 1996. The School of Music there is one of the nation\u2019s largest, with an extensive percussion program. According to John Scott, the chair of the search committee that hired him, Mr. Alorwoyie is the first \u2014 and still the only \u2014 tenured African drummer at an American university. \u201cThe first year he was here, all of a sudden he says he needs money to buy cloth to make clothes for the ensemble, so they look like an African ensemble,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201c\u2018O.K., where are we going come up in the budget with clothes money for an ensemble?\u2019 But you manage to do it.\u201d The rhythms Mr. Alorwoyie plays and teaches belong to a language that has been stored in generations of memory, rarely recorded or preserved. Ewe songs are forms of communication; in some cases, phrases like \u201cthe lion is coming\u201d are reinterpreted as drum patterns, part of an alarm system that existed among villages. (Some songs, Mr. Alorwoyie says, routinely contained criticism of different families in a community.) Without a written history, traditional Ghanaian drumming (of which there are thousands of tiny variations) is part of a family of African song forms that don\u2019t fit easily into Western pedagogical models. \u201cThere was a time when ethnomusicology was in some places not really integrated into music programs,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cIt was sort of the bottom of the pecking order; there\u2019s a whole strata of musicians who looked down on ethnomusicology and ethnic music: \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t want to deal with this, it\u2019s not art music.\u2019 Just like the people who looked down on jazz and said, \u2018This is not real music.\u2019\u201d Kobla Ladzekpo, who taught for 38 years at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Abraham Adzenyah, who was at Wesleyan University for 46, are both master drummers from Ghana who enjoyed strong support from their academic communities, but neither ever had a title above adjunct professor. \u201cAfrican traditional performance arts have no conventional place in higher education schools of music or music conservatories,\u201d said David Locke, the chair of the music department at Tufts University, who has known Mr. Alorwoyie for four decades and collaborated with him on a research project on the Ewe drum language that resulted in a 2013 book. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily think that bias is actually capturing that, it\u2019s more of a historical condition that seems to make natural sense. On the other hand, there is a lot of prejudice and misunderstanding of African arts and performance arts and African ways of life.\u201d Without a notational system, the rhythms must be passed directly from generation to generation. \u201cThere\u2019s not a classroom that\u2019s going to teach you,\u201d Mr. Alorwoyie said. \u201cIn the villages and towns and cottages, you\u2019re not going to see nobody teaching nobody how to drum.\u201d He and the performers he brought to Denton for the festival are part of the group trying to transmit this fragile knowledge. \u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d said Godwin Abotsi, 37, a Ghanaian drummer and dancer who lives in Fort Collins, Colo., pointing to his head. In December, Mr. Alorwoyie and several of his students traveled to New York for a performance of \u201cDrumming\u201d with the ensemble Mantra Percussion at National Sawdust. The Ghanaian ensemble presented traditional compositions and dances, alternating with Mantra\u2019s performances of works by Mr. Reich. For \u201cDrumming,\u201d the two groups played in tandem, with Mr. Reich\u2019s piece fitting like a skin over a complex rhythmic skeleton led by Mr. Alorwoyie. The staggered bell pattern that anchors many Ghanaian rhythms became a beacon amid the phased bongo cycles of Mr. Reich\u2019s composition \u2014 an indigenous form cradling a modern one. (Through a publicist, Mr. Reich declined to comment for this article.) Even in Africa, the sacred songs and rhythms that Mr. Alorwoyie teaches are struggling, with the drummers and dancers of Ghana\u2019s national ensemble earning salaries that barely sustain them. Hiplife, a form of popular music heavily influenced by reggae, has some strands of traditional drumming, but in general those traditions are not highly valued by younger people. \u201cIt\u2019s associated with the past, it\u2019s associated with rural areas, you don\u2019t make money from it,\u201d Mr. Locke said of the traditional style. \u201cYou go to a funeral, and the D.J.s have their sound systems, and they\u2019re blasting the music at very, very high volumes, and the traditional folk are playing their traditional drums right next to where the D.J.s are set up. It\u2019s like the Industrial Revolution versus the preindustrial world.\u201d Mr. Alorwoyie travels to Ghana several times a year to attend to affairs that concern his chieftaincy, but he also is attempting to pass his library of music on to people who can sustain it. Rather than update the old patterns, he said that at this point in his life, he must return to the rhythms he knows; history demands it. \u201cIf I am trying to teach something else creatively,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to lose those very important messages.\u201d With this sense of reverence comes a teaching style in which anything less than what is expected is unacceptable. At a dress rehearsal for a festival performance, Mr. Alorwoyie gave a thorough dressing-down to both undergraduate students and veteran Ghanaian drummers. \u201cWhy are you talking?\u201d he asked sharply, after entering the backstage area and finding his dancers and drummers joking around at a moment when he wanted them to be entering for a procession. The ensemble fell silent. Mr. Alorwoyie \u2014 who is said to have been born with his fists curled tightly, marking him for life as a servant of rhythm \u2014 led them onstage, his body bouncing lightly to the beat of the squeeze drum under his arm, his eyes fixed intensely upon his charges.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/arts/music/gideon-alorwoyie-university-of-north-texas-ghana-steve-reich.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T11:43:07-04:00", "abstract": "The master drummer Torgbui Midawo Gideon Foli Alorwoyie, high priest of the Ewe cult and a teacher of Steve Reich, is sustaining his traditions in Texas.", "title": "A Servant of Rhythm From Ghana, in Texas", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Arts", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T11:43:07-04:00"}
