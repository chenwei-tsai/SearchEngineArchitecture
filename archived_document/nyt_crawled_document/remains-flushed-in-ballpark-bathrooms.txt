{"text": "The New York Mets were leading the Philadelphia Phillies, 2-1, after two innings when Tom McDonald stood up from his upper-deck seat at Citi Field. Nature was calling, and so was his obligation to his childhood friend and fellow Mets fan Roy Riegel, whose death nine years ago left Mr. McDonald, 56, vowing to honor their baseball bonds in an unconventional way: by disposing of Mr. Riegel\u2019s ashes in ballparks across the country. Even more unusual was his chosen method: flushing them down public restroom toilets in the ballparks between innings. \u201cThe game has to be in progress \u2014 that\u2019s a rule of mine,\u201d Mr. McDonald said one recent weeknight before entering a Citi Field bathroom, holding a little plastic bottle containing a scoopful of Mr. Riegel\u2019s cremains. He stepped into a bathroom stall and sprinkled the ashes into the toilet with as much decorum as the setting allowed. A couple of flushes later and Mr. Riegel\u2019s remains were presumably on a journey through Citi Field\u2019s plumbing. \u201cI took care of Roy, and I had to use the facilities myself,\u201d Mr. McDonald said, emerging from the stall with the empty container. \u201cSo I figure, you know, kill two birds.\u201d \u201cI always flush in between, though,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s another rule of mine.\u201d The key here is that Mr. Riegel was a plumber, so how better to honor him than by pumping his essence into the plumbing, Mr. McDonald said, adding that he has flushed Mr. Riegel\u2019s ashes at 16 stadiums so far while keeping journals of his trips. \u201cI know people might think it\u2019s weird, and if it were anyone else\u2019s ashes, I\u2019d agree,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for Roy, this is the perfect tribute to a plumber and a baseball fan and just a brilliant, wild guy.\u201d Mr. McDonald, who also goes by Porky, is a recently retired New York City Transit Authority office worker who has written about 3,000 poems, most of them about baseball, often traveling to ballparks across the country for inspiration. With no college education or formal instruction as a writer, he has cultivated an accessible, regular-fan style that owes much to his knockaround childhood in Astoria, Queens, not far from where the Mets play \u2014 which, it should be said, is in Flushing. Mr. McDonald and Mr. Riegel grew up a block apart and attended countless games together at Shea Stadium, which closed in 2008. As adolescents, they raced jubilantly onto the field when the Mets beat the Cincinnati Reds in Game 5 to win the National League pennant in 1973. They also suffered through many losing seasons. A watery send-off had not occurred to Mr. McDonald when he asked Mr. Riegel\u2019s family for a portion of his ashes shortly after his 2008 death. He originally had planned only to scatter them in ballparks and other poignant spots. He rubbed the ashes tenderly into the asphalt of the schoolyard at Public School 70 in Astoria, where the two had played pickup baseball, football and roller hockey. He smudged them proudly onto a marker on Lower Broadway commemorating the city\u2019s ticker-tape parade for the Mets after their 1969 World Series victory. He dusted them onto Shea\u2019s original home plate location, which is designated by a marker in Citi Field\u2019s parking lot. But scattering the ashes at some stadiums posed problems. Mr. McDonald\u2019s first attempt, at a Pittsburgh Pirates game in 2009 at PNC Park, was met with a gust of wind, recalled Adam Boneker, 46, a friend who has accompanied Mr. McDonald on many of his trips to ballparks to dump the ashes. \u201cIt was awkward,\u201d Mr. Boneker recalled, adding that they resolved to try it at a Minnesota Twins game at the Metrodome in Minneapolis but, once there, realized that an indoor stadium was not an appropriate setting. Afterward, at a nearby Irish pub, a frustrated Mr. McDonald excused himself to use the bathroom. He returned smiling and declared triumphantly, \u201c\u2018I just took care of Roy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Boneker recalled. Mr. McDonald had flushed the ashes in the bathroom. \u201cRight there, it hit me,\u201d Mr. McDonald said. \u201cAfter that, it just took on a life of its own.\u201d In the years that followed, he \u2014 often with Mr. Boneker \u2014 flushed ashes in stadiums in Arizona, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Mo., Toronto, Detroit, Cincinnati, Baltimore and elsewhere. In Cleveland, Mr. Riegel\u2019s ashes were flushed at both Progressive Field and at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, because Mr. Riegel was a devout rocker. In Chicago, Mr. McDonald flushed them at a White Sox game but not at a game of the Cubs, the Mets\u2019 old National League nemesis. \u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2014 not in a joke way \u2014 but funny that it was exactly like Roy would have wanted it,\u2019\u2019 Mr. McDonald said. Over the years, a wide circle of Mr. McDonald\u2019s friends have gotten updates on the latest disposals. \u201cIt became kind of an inside joke: What\u2019s the best place for Roy\u2019s ashes?\u201d said Mr. McDonald, whose friendship with Mr. Riegel stretched back to Pack 65 of the Cub Scouts and through adulthood as the fun moved into local bars. Mr. Riegel was \u201ca major partyer,\u201d Mr. McDonald said, and \u201cwalked that tightrope between genius and insanity.\u201d The fast life caught up with him, and he died at age 48 on April 8, 2008, the day of the home opener of the Mets\u2019 final season at Shea. Mr. McDonald attended the game without Mr. Riegel and returned home to find out his friend had died. He sat down and wrote \u201cA Final Opener, Indeed,\u201d a poem about how the start of each baseball season would renew their childhood friendship. \u201cEach April, we were once again, boys in constant, cool connection,\u201d wrote Mr. McDonald, who will read his poems next month at a symposium at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. In Mr. McDonald\u2019s Astoria studio apartment, filled with baseball and other memorabilia, he keeps Mr. Riegel\u2019s remaining ashes in a Planters peanuts can next to a set of World Series highlight videos and Mr. McDonald\u2019s collection of 149 autographs of baseball Hall of Famers. For each trip, Mr. McDonald spoons some ashes into an empty Advil bottle from the can, whose exterior is wrapped in old Mets ticket stubs. He said he had enough left for one more tribute, which he plans on doing at Durham Athletic Park, the former minor league ballpark in North Carolina where the 1988 movie \u201cBull Durham\u201d was filmed. Mr. Riegel\u2019s youngest brother, Hank Riegel, of Waterloo, N.Y., called Mr. McDonald\u2019s method of ash scattering appropriate, given his brother\u2019s offbeat outlook on life. \u201cHe\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, yeah, do that,\u2019\u201d Hank Riegel said. \u201cHe would definitely approve of it. Never once did Roy follow the rules.\u201d For years, Mr. McDonald consoled himself that at least Mr. Riegel never had to see his beloved Shea Stadium torn down. Only recently did he decide that Citi Field was worthy of Mr. Riegel\u2019s ashes. And so it was with a poignant smile that he tossed the empty Advil bottle in the bathroom trash can at Citi Field the other night and returned to his upper-deck seat. \u201cI know he\u2019s roaring at all this,\u201d Mr. McDonald said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/nyregion/remains-flushed-in-ballpark-bathrooms.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T14:41:56-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T14:41:56-04:00", "abstract": "A Mets fan is memorializing his plumber buddy by flushing his cremated remains into the pipes of baseball stadiums.", "title": "Honoring a Fellow Fan, One Ballpark Bathroom at a Time"}
