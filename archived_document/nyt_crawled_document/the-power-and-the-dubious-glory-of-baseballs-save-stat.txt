{"text": "Addison Reed is the Mets\u2019 setup man, the reliever who pitches the penultimate inning of the game based on the modern construction of baseball bullpens. All innings count the same, yet closers, who handle the game\u2019s final inning, get much of the fame and the financial rewards that come with it. Closers get to pump their fists, untuck their jerseys or mime shooting arrows into the sky when the victory is secured. Even the name of the statistic that defines their success has a tinge of the dramatic: save. The reliever who tosses at least the final inning of a victory of three runs or fewer, or finishes the game with the potential tying run on base, at the plate, or on deck, is rewarded with a save in the box score. The qualifications are a mouthful and arbitrary, but the statistic is ubiquitous. \u201cPeople like the saves,\u201d Reed said. Reed was once a closer himself. From 2012 to 2014, he averaged 34 saves a season for the Chicago White Sox and the Arizona Diamondbacks. After some struggles, a demotion to the minor leagues and a trade to the Mets in August 2015, he blossomed into one of baseball\u2019s best setup men. Still, saves are rewarded in baseball\u2019s salary-arbitration system, so the ones Reed racked up earlier in his career contributed to his sizable $7.75 million salary for the 2017 season. But even he has a problem with the statistic that has so helped his bottom line. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for the saves stat the previous few years,\u201d Reed said. But even so, he added, \u201cthe save stat is overhyped.\u201d It indeed may be, but the way bullpens are structured nowadays, the closer and the save receive the most attention. All-Star rosters are stuffed with closers, not middle relievers or setup men. And which factoid can fans recall more: that Jeurys Familia had a 2.55 earned run average in 2016, or that he had a major-league-leading 51 saves for the Mets? \u201cA save \u2014 it is an arbitrary number,\u201d Los Angeles Angels Manager Mike Scioscia said over the winter . \u201cBut at least it\u2019s a guideline that gives you a little base line of a player\u2019s performance.\u201d The save became a statistic in 1959 thanks to the baseball writer Jerome Holtzman. He once said that the term \u201csave\u201d had already been in use by the early part of that decade and that he had only developed the first formula for it. In that era of baseball, the complete-game starters were beginning to fade, and Holtzman wanted to recognize the growing number of relievers who logged important innings in games. The team\u2019s best reliever was usually called the stopper or fireman and often enough asked to work multiple innings. With the save, there was a way to quantify those who finished victories. By 1969, the save was officially recognized by Major League Baseball and later refined to its current requirements. Rollie Fingers, Goose Gossage, Bruce Sutter, Lee Smith and Dan Quisenberry brought notice to the statistic in the 1970 and \u201880s, often recording multi-inning saves. As relievers grew more prominent, 40 saves in a season became routine in the 1990s and 2000s because of closers such as Dennis Eckersley, Trevor Hoffman and Mariano Rivera, the career saves leader with 652. Francisco Rodriguez, a former Mets closer, set the single-season saves record with 62 with the Angels in 2008. As those number rose, so too did their financial value to the players who piled them up. Now, modern bullpens are built around the one-inning closer, normally the team\u2019s best and highest-paid reliever. Those bullpens are also built around the save, for teams try to get their closer as many save chances as possible \u2014 as opposed to assigning them what might be the most difficult situation of the game, regardless of the inning in which it comes along. \u201cIf we played in a nonemotional, noncompensated, neutral environment, I think we would flush that saves stat down the toilet,\u201d Houston Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said during the off-season.\u201cBut we don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThere is always going to be a constant pull and tug between players, compensation, manager and analytics about what\u2019s the smart thing to do,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut by far the smartest thing to do is win the game. That makes people like me happy.\u201d So is it time to rethink the save, or simply get rid of it, to let managers approach the game feeling less restricted in how they use their bullpens? \u201cDoing away with it is not the right thing,\u201d said Drew Storen, a former Washington Nationals closer and setup man and currently a reliever for the Cincinnati Reds, a team that has shown a willingness this season to dispatch with traditional bullpen roles. \u2019\u201cGuys are rewarded because of the save.\u2019\u2019 One issue with saves is that they are arbitrary. Why does a save have to be a three-run lead or less? Why not rely on advanced statistics that attempt to quantify the difficulty of a situation a reliever may find himself in? Why does pitching the final three innings of a game, regardless of the score, also count as a save? Gossage, a Hall of Fame closer, said in February that there was nothing particularly impressive about holding a three-run lead for a single inning. Any reliever who \u201ccan\u2019t save a three-run lead for one inning, they shouldn\u2019t even be in the big leagues,\u201d Gossage told N.J. Advance Media. Those who disagree with his notion argue that there is an emotional component of save situations that cannon be discounted. \u201cIt\u2019s the ninth inning,\u201d said Sandy Alderson, the Mets\u2019 general manager. \u201cYou\u2019re three outs away. I know how I react emotionally in the seventh, eighth, versus the ninth inning.\u201d Scioscia called closers a \u201cspecial breed.\u201d \u201cThe last three outs, although logic tells you it\u2019s just another three outs, my experience tells me it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some guys have trouble pitching in tight games.\u201d But the biggest moment of a game comes not always at its end. In fact, the average game last season featured 11.3 base runners, meaning that the leadoff hitter in the eighth inning would be the opponent\u2019s No. 3 or 4 hitter. The ninth would more likely start with the bottom of the order. So shouldn\u2019t the setup men assigned to the eighth inning be better rewarded than they are? Shouldn\u2019t they be treated almost as closers even if they are not piling up saves? \u201cTo me, I don\u2019t know why the save is such a big stat,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a weird topic.\u201d Saves are important, Reed said, but the heart of the order coming to bat in the middle of the game may be the more crucial moment. \u201cI honestly think that if you have a one-run lead in the fifth and you get out of it, that should be the save,\u201d said. \u201cAnd if you come in in the eighth with a three-run lead and nobody on, I think what happened in the fifth inning was more of a save than in the eighth or ninth.\u201d Then there is the even less-heralded work of a reliever who comes in without the benefit of a lead. Preventing your team from falling further behind in a close game could be considered a vital statistic. Right now, there is no stat that recognizes such an accomplishment, but Storen said there should be, maybe something called a \u201cdeficit hold.\u2019\u2019 \u201cA lot of times, the biggest innings I pitched were keeping the score 6-5 and we\u2019re losing,\u201d added Miami Marlins closer A. J. Ramos, a former setup man. \u201cI come in and keep the score close, and the next inning we take the lead or tie.\u201d To quantify the work of nonclosers, another statistic \u2014 holds \u2014 was developed in the 1980s for setup relievers who enter in a save situation and maintain the lead while recording at least one out. But even that does not necessarily satisfy Reed. \u201cI think the stats you should look at are the times you got out of a jam and your E.R.A., \u201d Reed said. \u201cIf you have a low E.R.A., you\u2019re doing your job. When I had 32 saves, my E.R.A. was in the high fours.\u201d Saves occupy such a rarefied place in baseball that they affect how the game is played. In the ninth inning of tie games on the road, or in extra innings, many managers decline to use their closer, preferring to send out other relievers and wait until the closer can potentially enter the bottom of the inning with a save opportunity. The Cleveland Indians demonstrated notable flexibility with relief roles after acquiring the star reliever Andrew Miller from the Yankees midway through last season and turning him into a multipurpose fireman. It also helped that Miller was durable and had already received his big payday \u2014 a four-year $36 million contract signed before the 2015 season. Miller had been handsomely rewarded by the Yankees for his previous bullpen work, even though he had very few saves before 2015. But when one of Miller\u2019s former bullpen mates in the Bronx, Dellin Betances, tried to follow Miller\u2019s lead and get $5 million in salary arbitration last winter, he was sharply criticized by the Yankees\u2019 president, Randy Levine. Betances is very good, but he has only been a fill-in closer for the Yankees. That was enough for Levine to argue that Betances did not deserve such a big payday. \u201cIt\u2019s like me saying, \u2018I\u2019m not the president of the Yankees; I\u2019m an astronaut,\u2019\u201d Levine said at the time. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not an astronaut, and Dellin Betances is not a closer.\u201d In the end, the arbitrator agreed with the Yankees and Betances ended up with $3 million for 2017 despite his three All-Star appearances from 2014 to 2016, and a 1.93 earned run average in that span \u2014 the fifth best in baseball. So it\u2019s no wonder that everyone wants to be a closer, with all those opportunities to pile up saves. And as long as baseball\u2019s compensation system continues to lavishly reward saves, Hinch said, managers will care about them. If it\u2019s important to players, it should be important to the manager, too. If the save ever goes out of fashion, Alderson said the financial dynamic surrounding it would change. For now, though, the smart money is on being a closer and coming into the ninth with as many three-run leads as possible. \u201cAs long as the game is making those choices and those designations, so is an arbiter,\u201d he said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/sports/baseball/the-power-and-the-dubious-glory-of-baseballs-save-stat.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T12:50:12-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T12:50:12-04:00", "abstract": "The closer is the swaggering star of many a bullpen.
