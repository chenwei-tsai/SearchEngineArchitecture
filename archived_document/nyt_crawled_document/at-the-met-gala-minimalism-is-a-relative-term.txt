{"text": "The theme of the exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute this year was fashion in an age of technology. This meant that people like Andrew Bolton, the institute\u2019s new head curator, along with Jonathan Ive of Apple \u2014 who served as a sponsor \u2014 spoke in lofty tones about the dichotomies of man versus machine, haute couture versus ready-to-wear, hand-sewn versus mass produced. For lay people, it meant a carefully curated exhibit of wild designer gowns and a gala celebration on Monday night at which the bulk of celebrity attendees wore metallics. Kanye West wore a loosefitting metallic jacket and a pair of colored contact lenses that turned his eyes a kind of iridescent blue. His wife, Kim Kardashian, wore metallic, beaded Balmain. The stylist Tabitha Simmons wore red and gold embroidered Dolce & Gabbana, looking rather like a chair in pre-revolutionary France. And the Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o donned a celery-green, metallic Calvin Klein dress, and an updo that seemed to recall both \u201cStar Wars\u201d and Nina Simone. At most major red carpet events, choices like these would be referred to as misfires. Here at the Met Gala, they imply merely that the attendees took the theme to heart. For example, the Fox News host Megyn Kelly had on a navy, fitted Badgley Mischka dress. There was glitter in her hair, which had been slicked back, Brigitte Nielsen style. \u201cIt was a lot of fun to wear it in a way that would ordinarily inspire a phone call from second-floor management,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. Sarah Jessica Parker wore 18th-century-inspired men\u2019s wear and said the evening was like a master class in fashion. \u201cSometimes you get an A and sometimes, it\u2019s a pass-or-fail situation,\u201d said Ms. Parker, who earned a fair share of ire last year for one such outfit. And Madonna had on a black lace Givenchy dress by Riccardo Tisci that left almost nothing about her rear end or her bosom to the imagination. Does she ever hear back from Ms. Wintour after making choices like these? \u201cOh, she doesn\u2019t speak to me,\u201d Madonna said. \u201cShe does speak to Riccardo, though.\u201d So anyway, the evening began on the red carpet just before 6 p.m., when Ms. Wintour arrived in a simple cream Chanel gown. Though she may be the brains behind this operation \u2014 whose involvement over the last decade and a half turned a trade-show-like event into a global social swirl that rivals the Oscars \u2014 she actually wanted the attention to go to Mr. Bolton, who created the exhibit on his own this year, the first since the retirement of Harold Koda, the Met\u2019s legendary costume chief. And the decisions about the exhibit, she said, were his entirely. Furthermore, after a China-themed exhibition last year with set pieces and lighting design complex enough to rival a U2 show, the desire this year was to do something a little simpler. But minimalism is a relative concept when you are talking about an exhibit of fur boleros and dresses made entirely of bones. One minute, Lady Gaga was ascending the stairs in a bustierlike top with platform shoes, along with fishnet stockings and no pants. The next, Kate Hudson was inches away from her, wearing a white dress that seemed to have been constructed entirely from shards of plexiglass. In came Claire Danes, her long hair pulled back, her husband, Hugh Dancy, on one arm, the designer Zac Posen on another, and a baby blue dress with a train so long it took an actual bus to get her there. Ms. Danes was not kidding when she explained this, prompting an obvious question: Was it remotely comfortable? \u201cUm,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m moving carefully and cautiously. And I\u2019m going to throw the whole after party under my dress.\u201d If no one was asking her if she was all right, that might just be because most of them were in a similar boat. The model Alessandra Ambrosio wore another metallic Balmain that looked as if it had been made from the mirrors at Studio 54. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy and it\u2019s uncomfortable,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is how it should be when you\u2019re coming to the Met Ball.\u201d Even former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took the theme to heart. Looking over at his companion, Diana L. Taylor, he said, \u201cShe gave me a wood bow tie made by machine.\u201d As in years past, the last major celebrity arrival was Beyonc\u00e9, who walked onto the red carpet at 8:40 p.m. in a nude-colored Givenchy dress that also had metallic embellishments and showed off her famous curves. Arriving fashionably late seemed apropos this year, coming a week after the release of her new album, \u201cLemonade,\u201d which hints strongly at possible past infidelity and discord in her marriage. But she was not there to talk about that, or why her husband, Jay Z, was not on her arm. The only question she answered was about how long it took to get ready. \u201cIt was actually a lot easier than last year,\u201d she said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/nyregion/at-the-met-gala-minimalism-is-a-relative-term.html", "published_date": "2016-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T10:41:15-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T10:39:39-04:00", "abstract": "Metallic and extravagant outfits, as usual, were consistent at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Anna Wintour Costume Center in New York.", "title": "At the Met Gala, Minimalism Is a Relative Term"}
