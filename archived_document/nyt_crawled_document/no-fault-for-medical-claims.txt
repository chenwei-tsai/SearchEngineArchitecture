{"section": "Opinion", "text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cG.O.P. Bill Would Make Malpractice Suits Harder to Win\u201d (news article, April 14): The largest injustice to patients is that the vast majority who suffer bad outcomes incur economic damages that are not large enough to justify the investment of the resources necessary to bring legal action, though the losses may be disastrous for the patient. These patients never enter the legal system and receive no compensation. A no-fault system, similar to workers\u2019 compensation, that compensated all patients for their full economic losses from predefined injuries would be equitable and benefit all involved, except the trial lawyers. Exceptions could be allowed for especially egregious cases. HERBERT RAKATANSKYPROVIDENCE, R.I.
