{"text": "\u201cHoney, doesn\u2019t this look just like a Gray Malin photograph?\u201d The photographer Gray Malin says he heard an American woman loudly exclaim this to her husband last summer at La Fontelina, a sun-dappled, umbrella-studded beach club in Capri, Italy. Mr. Malin, 31, was understandably thrilled and introduced himself. \u201cThey were on their honeymoon, we took a photo and it was so cute,\u201d he said. \u201cBut really, I was just as surprised as she was.\u201d Then, using a Canon camera, he went back to shooting La Fontelina, the type of place where everyone looks as if they just stepped off a yacht. It is a staple of \u201cLa Dolce Vita,\u201d his continuing series chronicling the glamour of the Italian Riviera. For eight years, Mr. Malin has been churning out pieces that don\u2019t require a background in art to appreciate: balloon-covered llamas on the Bolivian salt flats, brightly hued life preservers floating on top of a pool, balloon letters above a beach that spell \u201cI am busy.\u201d Along with framed prints (priced as high as $18,000), there are Gray Malin water bottles, luggage tags, iPhone covers, sneakers, hotel key cards, beach towels, drink trays and candle holders. There are collaborations with Neiman Marcus and shoots for which brands like Veuve Cliquot and Le Meridien pick up the tab. Mr. Malin\u2019s rise dovetailed with that of Instagram, where he has more than 231,000 followers, and the platform exposed his work to celebrity fans including Rihanna and Reese Witherspoon. \u201cHis beautifully composed aerial images caught my eye,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon wrote in an email. \u201cI love the feeling they evoke of beautiful days in the sun and living a colorful life.\u201d Like an Amazon algorithm, Mr. Malin has figured out, through every step of his photography career, what his audience liked and then altered his output accordingly. In 2009, he was selling prints for $65 apiece at flea markets around Los Angeles. \u201cI met and networked and learned what people were looking for in their homes, and if something did resonate, I thought, \u2018How can I further develop this work into other work that people will want to hang?\u2019\u201d he said, sitting at an enormous computer monitor in the conference room of his company\u2019s headquarters in West Hollywood, Calif. Outside, a dozen young staff members tapped diligently in front of similarly oversize screens. \u201cEvery photograph I started to take went from photography to fine-art photography to photographs that are meant to look great inside your home,\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cIt was like social media before social media.\u201d He is intimately acquainted with such a concept: His mother, Amy Muzzy Malin, edited the interior design sections of Glamour and Mademoiselle magazines before the family moved from New York to Dallas (his father is a real estate developer). In Dallas, Ms. Malin oversaw photo shoots and scouted locations for other magazines, and often brought Gray along. \u201cI\u2019d do my homework in the corner while they were shooting interiors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I was very aware of, at a young age, how a room looked.\u201d At 16, he took a high school photography class, spending nights and weekends in the darkroom and studying the clean lines of the Hungarian photographer Andre Kertesz. At Emerson College, Mr. Malin studied photography and marketing, to appease his parents. After school, he moved to Los Angeles to work in the promotions department of Paramount Studios but quit after a year. He got an internship with David LaChapelle and spent a week watching him shoot a Dos Equis ad. Then he interned with Jill Greenberg, the photographer known for her plasticized-looking portraits of celebrities including Simon Cowell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gwen Stefani. \u201cI realized I didn\u2019t want to do commercial work or portraiture,\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cI really wanted to do fine art, which sounds so 21-year-old-y.\u201d He enrolled in continuing-education classes and took odd jobs like assisting on a wedding. \u201cI shot some family in Manhattan Beach\u2019s Christmas card,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all wore white shirts and jeans.\u201d After a teacher asked him to do a humorous photo series, Mr. Malin visited Marfa, the art hub in West Texas that his parents had frequented since he was 13. On a lark, he threw a banana peel on the highway in front of the Prada Marfa installation and took a picture of it. His teacher and classmates loved the shot. Six months later, in September 2010, he returned to Marfa to do a more organized shoot around the Prada store. His lanky cousin served as a model, his father\u2019s buddy brought a mule, and a friend from Paramount brokered a deal for secondhand Prada shopping bags after Mr. Malin\u2019s eBay searches came up empty. \u201cIt\u2019s hysterical how hard it is to get shopping bags,\u201d he said. Mr. Malin had started on the flea-market circuit in 2009, and when he introduced the Marfa photos, they flew out of his booth. Around the same time, the home goods site One Kings Lane was picking up steam, and Mr. Malin emailed the company to see if it would be interested in selling his work. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really seen anything like it,\u201d said Susan Feldman, a founder of One Kings Lane. The site would put up limited quantities of Mr. Malin\u2019s prints and they would routinely sell out; he would invite friends over to watch movies while they slapped labels on boxes. \u201cIt was just what I was hoping \u2014 I was seeding myself into these somewhat affluent homes all over the country,\u201d Mr. Malin said. He eventually embarked on more ambitious projects: shooting beach scenes from helicopters over Miami and Kauai, Hawaii, and joining a National Geographic expedition to Antarctica, where he juxtaposed a beach ball with hulking glaciers. At Art Basel Miami Beach, he met the Bolivian photographer Gaston Ugalde (the \u201cAndean Warhol,\u201d according to some critics). Mr. Malin mentioned wanting to stage a shoot on Salar de Uyuni, the world\u2019s largest salt flat, in southwest Bolivia; Mr. Ugalde offered to take him there. \u201cHe surprised me, actually,\u201d Mr. Ugalde said. \u201cThe first impressions I had of him are very, not fragile, but a very delicate person. It\u2019s surprising to me that he was so great and he had balance and he wasn\u2019t afraid of making the trip on his own to the salt flats.\u201d But what about the great salt flat of the internet where much art is now promoted and sold? After creating an e-commerce site in 2013, Mr. Malin sought out \u201con brand\u201d social media influencers, like the model Rocky Barnes, who might be open to hanging a print in their homes and sharing a photo of it on their own feeds. \u201cNow,\u201d Mr. Malin said, \u201cthey really want to get paid.\u201d Mr. Malin himself is a low-key presence, spending summers on Lake Michigan with his husband, Jeff Richardson, a former business analyst for Mattel and Disney who became the chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Gray Malin last year and oversees pesky things like shipping and logistics. Mr. Malin wears polo shirts and sweaters around his neck and chooses not to dye gray streaks in his close-cropped hair. At a Vanity Fair party before the Oscars, while sequined starlets swirled around, he gushed that the most exciting week of his life was when Jenna Bush filmed a \u201cToday\u201d show segment on him and Maria Shriver came over to look at prints. \u201cIn one week, there was a Kennedy and a Bush in my house,\u201d he said. As for the current administration, \u201cthe day after the election, my dad called me and said, \u2018Are you kind of excited about this, for your brand?\u2019\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Are you kidding? I\u2019m devastated!\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018But think about it, you bring this escape to everyone,\u201d he remembers his father telling him. \u201c\u2018And now more than ever, people are going to need the escape.\u2019\u201d Indeed, Mr. Malin\u2019s professional Instagram profile says that he is \u201con a mission to make every day a getaway.\u201d In the aquamarine-hue feed of photos that follows, there is no indication of political tensions or nuisances like Mondays and hailstorms. If art reflects the times, this art reflects a collective desire to decamp to some place with beautiful natural light and no visible charging cables. While Mr. Malin claims he knows \u201clike, no artists,\u201d some have taken note. \u201cI get jealous sometimes,\u201d Mr. Ugalde said. \u201cI get jealous in a very positive way. He\u2019s very young, he\u2019s not trying to influence the collector or the observer with big philosophical, conceptual messages. Sometimes, it\u2019s just to make people happy.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/fashion/gray-malin-photographs.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T16:57:33-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T16:57:26-04:00", "abstract": "His pictures of balloons, life preservers and llamas are meant to soothe rather than provoke, and Rihanna and Reese Witherspoon are among his fans.", "title": "The Sunny Escapism of the Photographer Gray Malin"}
