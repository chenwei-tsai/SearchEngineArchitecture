{"text": "CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. \u2014 The attorney general of the United States, Jeff Sessions, on Friday came to this Long Island area besieged by the transnational gang known as MS-13, and in a 20-minute speech to local police commissioners and sheriffs vowed to eradicate the gang by, above all, cracking down on illegal immigration. He likened the gang, which has links to El Salvador, to the Colombian cartel and the mafia, and said that it smuggled gang members across the United States border and recruited young immigrants to its ranks. His message was a familiar one, and it bore the blessing of President Trump, who Mr. Sessions said was aware of the violence affecting Suffolk County, where the bodies of four young men were found brutally murdered in a Central Islip park on April 13. The authorities believe the killings were linked to MS-13, which would bring the gang\u2019s body count to 15 in Suffolk County since the beginning of 2016, the most violent stretch to date since MS-13 took hold here in the late 1990s. \u201cThe MS-13 motto is kill, rape and control,\u201d Mr. Sessions said at the United States Courthouse here. \u201cOur motto is justice for victims and consequences for criminals. That\u2019s how simple it is. Prosecute them, and after they\u2019ve been convicted, if they\u2019re not here lawfully, they\u2019re going to be deported.\u201d Mr. Sessions talked tough, declaring that \u201cthis is the Trump era,\u201d when the federal government would back law enforcement. He did not offer assurances to the sizable immigrant community that its members could feel comfortable coming forward to report crimes to the police without worrying about their immigration status. That has been an issue for local law enforcement officials, who fear that the Trump administration\u2019s promise to crackdown on undocumented immigrants will further distrust. In presentations throughout the county, the Suffolk County police commissioner, Timothy Sini, has made it clear that no one would be asked about their immigration status. Last week, speaking at a memorial service for one of the four young men killed, Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from the second district of New York, which includes Central Islip and neighboring Brentwood, echoed that statement. \u201cI certainly can\u2019t speak for the Trump administration, but they\u2019re not going to be deporting anyone who comes forward to report a crime like this,\u201d Mr. King said. Mr. Sessions said that prosecuting immigrants who had entered the country illegally and committed crimes was still the federal government\u2019s priority, and that the government was not \u201cout seeking witnesses to crimes to deport.\u201d But, he added, \u201cIt cannot be that the attorney general grants immunity contrary to law for people who violate the laws of the United States.\u201d Before Mr. Sessions arrived, about 200 protesters gathered in the early morning outside the courthouse building, across the lawn from the armored cars and Homeland Security guards. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that his response is anti-immigrant, which would lead to racial profiling Latinos, African-Americans,\u201d said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, who is the president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury. But Representative King was visibly angered by their presence. He had invited Mr. Sessions to come to Long Island to meet with law enforcement officials to help solve the problem, and attended a news conference after Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech. \u201cThey should be on their knees thanking him, not out there protesting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful, it\u2019s disgraceful that leaders in the community would criticize the attorney general.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/jeff-sessions-ms-13-gang-long-island.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T13:10:42-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T13:10:42-04:00", "abstract": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the best way to get rid of the gang, with its ties to El Salvador, was to crack down on illegal immigration.", "title": "On Long Island, Sessions Vows to Eradicate MS-13 Gang"}
