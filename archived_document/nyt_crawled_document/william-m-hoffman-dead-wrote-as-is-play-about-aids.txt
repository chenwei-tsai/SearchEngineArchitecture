{"text": "William M. Hoffman, whose epochal play \u201cAs Is\u201d was in the vanguard of Broadway\u2019s coming to grips with the AIDS epidemic and who wrote the groundbreaking libretto for John Corigliano\u2019s opera \u201cThe Ghosts of Versailles,\u201d died on Saturday in the Bronx. He was 78. The cause was cardiac arrest, his husband, William Russell Taylor II, said. Mr. Hoffman began his career as a book editor at Hill and Wang, where he published gay and lesbian playwrights in the \u201cNew American Plays\u201d series and in the 1979 anthology \u201cGay Plays: The First Collection.\u201d In doing so, he promoted the careers of Jane Chambers, Tom Eyen, Joe Orton, Robert Patrick and Lanford Wilson, among others. He followed his success as a writer by teaching, as a professor of journalism, communication and theater at Lehman College of the City University of New York, and as the host of \u201cConversations with William M. Hoffman,\u201d a regularly scheduled program in which he interviewed theatrical and musical personalities on the cable channel CUNY-TV. In 1985, Mr. Hoffman\u2019s \u201cAs Is\u201d and Larry Kramer\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d \u201crepresented the opening salvo in the theatrical war against AIDS,\u201d Prof. Roger W. Oliver of The Juilliard School and New York University wrote in The Juilliard Journal in 2010. \u201cAs Is,\u201d about a gay couple coping with the terrifying new pandemic, opened on March 10, 1985. It was produced by the Glines, a gay theater company, in association with Circle Repertory, and moved two months later to Broadway, where it ran for 285 performances and was nominated for several Tony Awards, including best play. It won the 1985 Drama Desk and Obie Awards for outstanding new production. \u201cAs Is\u201d is \u201cvery specifically about gay relationships, the problems that straights have in understanding and accepting gay sexuality, as well as the problems gays face in trying to deal with the disease that is destroying them,\u201d Joel Shatzky wrote in a 1992 essay, \u201cAIDS Enters the American Theater: \u2018As Is\u2019 and \u2018The Normal Heart.\u2019\u201d Mel Gussow wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Hoffman had \u201cfound exactly the appropriate tone for his subject, a dramaturgical equivalent of the title of the play.\u201d \u201cHe leads us to view the disease, its victims (actual and potential), and its survivors as is,\u201d Mr. Gussow continued, \u201cwithout a gloss of self-pity or sentimentality.\u201d Mr. Hoffman adapted the play for television in 1986, on the Showtime network, starring Robert Carradine, Jonathan Hadary and Colleen Dewhurst. Mr. Corigliano, the composer, and Mr. Hoffman, writing the libretto in English, took seven years to complete \u201cThe Ghosts of Versailles,\u201d which the Metropolitan Opera had commissioned in 1980 to celebrate the company\u2019s centennial in 1983. It had its premiere at the Met in 1991 \u2014 the first new opera performed there since 1967, and the first by either of the collaborators. With a cast that included Graham Clark, Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Marilyn Horne, Hakan Hagegard, Gino Quilico and Teresa Stratas, it was a critical sensation. Its central conceit: 200 years after the French Revolution, the playwright Beaumarchais is summoned to amuse the bored ghosts of the aristocrats who hover about the palace of Versailles and to use his drama to court the ghost of Marie Antoinette. \u201cTo me, the opera is primarily a love story, but it is also about the French Revolution, the nature of revolution in general, the nature of love, and the nature of time,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. Edward Rothstein wrote in The Times that \u201cGhosts\u201d brought \u201ccamp humor, postmodern pastiche, parody and effulgent tonal nostalgia to the Met.\u201d In 2016, \u201cGhosts\u201d won Grammy Awards for best opera recording and best engineered classical album, for the Los Angeles Opera\u2019s 2015 cast recording. During rehearsals for the Met\u2019s performance, Mr. Hoffman began working on \u201cRiga,\u201d a play about the murder of members of his family in Latvia during World War II. The play, which focused on two gay men, one black and one Jewish, opened in Los Angeles in 1999. \u201cI\u2019m trying to detoxify our culture,\u201d Mr. Hoffman told The Los Angeles Times. \u201cThis play, I hope, becomes a mirror\u201d in which people see themselves and the hatred that surrounds them.\u201d William Moses Hoffman was born on April 12, 1939, in Manhattan to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. His father, Morton, was a caterer. His mother, the former Johanna Papiermeister, was a jeweler. In addition to Mr. Taylor, he is survived by a brother, Edin Hoffman. He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the City College of New York, where he majored in English and Latin. Beginning in the mid-1960s, he wrote a number of short plays at Caffe Cino and La MaMa Experimental Theater Club. In 1977, he and Anthony Holland wrote \u201cCornbury: The Queen\u2019s Governor,\u201d about Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, the reputedly cross-dressing colonial governor of New York in the early 1700s. (It was revived in New York in 2009.) Mr. Hoffman was also nominated for a writing Emmy for the daytime soap opera \u201cOne Life to Live,\u201d a title that captures how a character in \u201cAs Is\u201d comes to grips with his homosexuality when he is struck with AIDS. Recounting his struggle to overcome a lonely childhood, the character, a promising fiction writer named Rich, says, \u201cI was so desperate to find people like myself I would look for them in the indexes of books, under H.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/theater/william-m-hoffman-dead-wrote-as-is-play-about-aids.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T19:43:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "created_date": "2017-05-01T19:43:05-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Hoffman began his career as a book editor and also wrote the groundbreaking libretto for John Corigliano\u2019s opera \u201cThe Ghosts of Versailles.\u201d", "title": "William M.
