{"text": "May is only just beginning, but the temperature in the American League East has been rising rapidly. After Baltimore\u2019s Manny Machado took out Boston\u2019s Dustin Pedroia with a late slide a little more than a week ago, Pedroia\u2019s teammate Matt Barnes threw a pitch that buzzed Machado\u2019s ear, which the Orioles did not care for \u2014 and neither did Pedroia, as he made clear after the game. On Sunday in Toronto, when Tampa Bay\u2019s Chris Archer threw a fastball behind the head of Jose Bautista, it was viewed by Blue Jays Manager John Gibbons as payback for Blue Jays reliever Joe Biagini hitting the hand of Rays outfielder Steven Souza Jr. the previous day. The Yankees, in contrast, have steered clear of any testy conflict in the division \u2014 perhaps because, for the first month of the season, they have found very little with which to take offense. But arriving in town on Monday were the Blue Jays, the team that has gotten under the Yankees\u2019 skin more than any other during the past two seasons. The Blue Jays won 25 of 38 games against the Yankees in that span, blowing past them down the stretch in 2015 and winning three of four late last September, helping them clinch a wild-card berth and all but eliminating the Yankees. Their last meeting of 2016 was a memorable one: Yankees pitcher Luis Severino hit the Blue Jays slugger Josh Donaldson; the Blue Jays\u2019 J. A. Happ answered by plunking Chase Headley; and Severino responded by hitting Justin Smoak. That led to two bench-clearing dust-ups in the first two innings, a welt under the eye of Yankees outfielder Tyler Austin and ejections for Severino, Manager Joe Girardi, the bench coach Rob Thomson and the pitching coach Larry Rothschild. The Yankees had the last word when Mark Teixeira hit a game-winning home run off reliever Jason Grilli in the ninth inning \u2014 which Teixeira punctuated with a bat flip and some extra words for Grilli from the dugout. The Yankees viewed it as giving the Blue Jays \u2014 \u201cthe kings of fun,\u201d Headley called them \u2014 a little taste of their own sauce. It was Bautista, of course, whose bat flip after a late home run in the 2015 playoffs so rankled the Texas Rangers that they hit him in their final meeting last year \u2014 which Bautista answered with a hard slide that begot an overhand right to his chin by Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor. \u201cWe\u2019re all a big brotherhood \u2014 without competitive juices flowing, we all get along great,\u201d Bautista said. \u201cBut sometimes your emotions get into it, and competitiveness gets into it, too, and that alpha-male instinct that we all have to some extent, it kind of gets in between that. A lot of it is also the history of the sport and how it\u2019s supposed to be played. Up to this point, there hasn\u2019t been anybody who has gotten seriously hurt, and hopefully that continues to be the case.\u201d Incidents like the recent ones in the division may well be a reflection of its changing nature. The Red Sox and the Yankees used to dominate, with Pedro Martinez seemingly dusting hitters for kicks, but now virtually everyone is in the race. The Red Sox, the Orioles and the Blue Jays each made the playoffs last year, and the competition figures to be just as fierce this year if the Blue Jays can recover from a spate of injuries and a dreadful 8-17 start. \u201cMaybe it used to be the Red Sox and the Yankees, but it\u2019s such a competitive division, nobody wants to get taken to the carwash,\u201d Yankees reliever Tommy Layne said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see these kinds of things happening.\u201d \u201cThis is a heavyweight division, man,\u201d said Grilli, who added that there was a greater sensitivity now to incidents like Machado\u2019s slide, especially after last year\u2019s rule change, which is supposed to prohibit takeout plays. \u201cThat used to be called hard baseball, breaking up a double play,\u201d Grilli said. \u201cIn that play, Machado was almost hugging him, holding it up,\u201d he added, referring to the Red Sox\u2019 Pedroia. \u201cWe can pick things apart, but hey, everybody\u2019s out to win. When you see that, it\u2019s guys wanting to fight to win. If that wasn\u2019t happening, people would be bored, like there wasn\u2019t any competition.\u201d Layne, who began last season with the Red Sox, agreed. \u201cSome people look at it, and they don\u2019t like that aspect of the game,\u201d Layne said. \u201cI love it. I think that\u2019s still keeping some of the traditional aspects of protecting your players and your teammates. But I think it breeds a better baseball.\u201d He added: \u201cHow long did people talk about the bat flip and the situation between Texas and Bautista? It brings attention to the game, which is not a bad thing. You put any person in this room, and their sibling\u2019s getting beat up, they\u2019re going to help \u2019em out. This is a family here.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/sports/baseball/american-league-east-yankees.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T21:40:57-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T21:40:57-04:00", "abstract": "It used to be all about the Yankees and the Red Sox.
