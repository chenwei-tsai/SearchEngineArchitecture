Based on research she did at the Yivo Institute for Jewish Research, a concert devoted to her work on Thursday, May 4, at the Center for Jewish History features \u201cNumber Six Goerck Street,\u201d a duet (the mezzo-soprano Rachel Calloway and the violinist Ari Streisfeld) about a 1905 rent strike by immigrants in the Lower East Side, and \u201cThe Dybbuk on Second Avenue,\u201d a piano solo (Kathleen Supov\u00e9). Other pieces are inspired by the experience of her immigrant grandparents; Ms. Gosfield herself will be among the performers.
