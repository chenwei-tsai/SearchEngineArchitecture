{"text": "JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 \u201cLook, Sir,\u201d the taxi driver said to me, pointing at a newly built five-story building. \u201cThat\u2019s a community health center. At one point it had practically collapsed, and now it\u2019s five floors high!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a Muslim, Sir,\u201d he added. \u201cI can see that Jakarta is finally being developed properly. I\u2019ve been in the streets every day for 15 years, and only now can I say that things are working as they should.\u201d Damn, I thought. It was three days before the second round of the gubernatorial election in Jakarta last month, an epic drama about race and prejudice that has divided people throughout Indonesia \u2014 at the presidential palace, in mosques, across social media and in many homes. The driver said he was a supporter of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as Ahok, Jakarta\u2019s incumbent governor. Ahok had promoted more transparent budgets, bureaucratic reform and better urban infrastructure. Ahok is also Christian and ethnic Chinese, and it\u2019s important to say this, because that\u2019s largely the reason that a few days after that taxi ride he lost his post to Anies Baswedan, a former minister of education and culture. Ethnic Chinese make up a little more than 1 percent of Indonesia\u2019s population. They have suffered from prejudice since colonial times, as well as occasional bouts of mass violence, partly a result of anti-Communism. But Muslim radicalism has gained traction in mainstream politics in recent years, and threatened the Chinese minority in new ways \u2014 as well as this Muslim-majority country\u2019s long tradition of religious tolerance. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about Ahok in front of the family,\u201d my mother-in-law had told me during a visit to Jakarta in February. She reminded me that her nieces and nephews were participating then in a wave of demonstrations that came to be known as the \u201cDefend Islam\u201d rallies. The protests were set off by a speech Ahok gave in late September criticizing political rivals for quoting the Quran in order to sway Muslim constituents against him. Ahok said the people were being \u201cdeceived with Surat Al-Maidah 51,\u201d a Quranic verse that the government\u2019s department of religion has translated into Bahasa Indonesia as prohibiting Muslims from selecting Christians or Jews as leaders or allies. For that, the Indonesia Ulema Council issued a fatwa saying that Ahok had insulted the Quran. The Islam Defenders Front (Front Pembela Islam, or F.P.I., in Bahasa), a hard-line radical Islamist organization, took him to court for blasphemy, which is punishable by up to five years in prison. Led by F.P.I., supporters of Ahok\u2019s rivals waged the demonstrations. Blasphemy cases are nothing new in Indonesia. Artists and critics have been prosecuted for writing a short story about the Prophet Muhammad descending to earth or publishing a popularity contest ranking him 11th, among other things. But the Ahok case is newly worrying because in the wake of the Defend Islam demonstrations, radical Islamic groups have spoken in favor of establishing Islamic law throughout Indonesia. Shariah currently is practiced only in the northwestern province of Aceh. The Defend Islam protests were staged on catchy, symbolic dates. The first one took place on Nov. 4, 2016, and was called \u201c411 Rally\u201d: \u201c411\u201d looks like the word \u201cAllah\u201d in Arabic script. The second protest, held on Dec. 2, 2016, became the \u201c212\u201d rally, a reference to a popular martial arts novel. The demonstrations resonated widely. For example, the artist Ardian Syaf secretly slipped into two panels of his new \u201cX-Man Gold #1\u201d comic book signs of his support for the Defend Islam Rallies. In one, he drew \u201c212\u201d on a building; in another, \u201cQS 5:51,\u201d referring to Al-Maidah 51, appears on the uniform of a baseball player. Previously, F.P.I. was best known for carrying out vigilante attacks at sites it considers immoral, like bars or clubs. Now, it has brought Islamic law into mainstream politics. In the recent Jakarta election, the group openly supported the candidacy of Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, better known as AHY, with the slogan, \u201cDon\u2019t elect a non-Muslim leader.\u201d Despite that backing, AHY \u2014 an army major and the son of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), Indonesia\u2019s sixth president \u2014 fell short during the first round in February, winning only 17 percent of votes. (Ahok got 43 percent, and Anies about 39 percent.) After his loss, supporters of the Defend Islam movement switched their support to Anies. Although Anies won the second round, and the governorship, the F.P.I.\u2019s job hardly is finished. Its target no longer is Ahok, but the electorate at large. And its ultimate objective is the 2019 presidential election. \u201cOur neighbors keep on trying to get us to join the Defend Islam rallies,\u201d my younger sister complained to me recently. \u201cThey say that, as Muslims, we have a duty to respond.\u201d She and I live in the same housing complex on the outskirts of Jakarta. Our neighborhood has a WhatsApp group forum, originally set up to discuss community issues like safety or road repairs. I don\u2019t check the messages, but she does, and she says they promote an Islamic political agenda. Intimidating slogans seem to be popping up everywhere around us. A number of mosques throughout Jakarta have hung banners proclaiming, \u201cThis mosque doesn\u2019t pray for dead supporters of blasphemers;\u201d they refer, of course, to Ahok\u2019s backers. Some Friday sermons now exhort, \u201cMuslims choose Muslim leaders,\u201d even though the law prohibits the use of mosques for political campaigning. The reaction to that proselytizing is no less excessive: Banners have also appeared warning that Jakarta will soon implement Shariah law. It\u2019s tempting, and perhaps reassuring, to cast the Jakarta election as a standard contest for power among political elites. After all, the dynamics of that gubernatorial contest familiar patterns in national politics. SBY backed his son AHY. President Joko Widodo and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, the main party in Parliament, supported Ahok. Prabowo Subianto, who lost the presidential election to Joko in 2014, endorsed Anies. And so Anies\u2019s ultimate victory over Ahok last month looks like a rebuttal to both Prabowo\u2019s loss to Joko and Joko\u2019s decision to remove Anies from his position as minister of education and culture last year. In fact, the Jakarta election stands for something much more ominous. More gubernatorial and local elections are planned throughout the country next year, and a presidential election is scheduled for 2019. Indonesian politicians like AHY and Anies have played with fire by sharing the political stage with religious groups: Because of them, radical Islamic groups are the new kingmakers of Indonesian politics.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/opinion/an-election-in-jakarta-an-omen-for-indonesia.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T10:08:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-05-02T10:08:24-04:00", "abstract": "Radical Islamic groups are the new kingmakers of Indonesian politics.", "title": "An Election in Jakarta, an Omen for Indonesia"}
