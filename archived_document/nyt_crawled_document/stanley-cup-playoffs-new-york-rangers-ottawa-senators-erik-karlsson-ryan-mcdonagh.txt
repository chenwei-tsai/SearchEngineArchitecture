{"text": "KANATA, Ontario \u2014 Erik Karlsson, the top defenseman of the Ottawa Senators, does not have much in common with Ryan McDonagh, his Rangers counterpart, when it comes to on-ice style. Karlsson, a two-time winner of the Norris Trophy and a nominee this season, is an offensive machine whose scoring and playmaking ability draw comparisons to Bobby Orr and Paul Coffey. He cruises around the ice like a shark eying injured prey, and when the puck finds his stick, he frequently makes otherworldly passes that send viewers reaching for the replay button on their remotes. The gritty McDonagh is known more for his driving and physical style, although he did have 36 assists this season. They share an intangible leadership quality. Both have commanded the respect of teammates and coaches, a major reason they were named captains within four days of each other in October 2014. And both appear to deftly navigate the fine line between leading by example and verbally prodding their teammates when needed. The collective skills of both captains will be on display in the second-round showdown between the teams starting Thursday night at Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa. Derrick Brassard, traded from the Rangers to the Senators for Mika Zibanejad in July, knows both players well. \u201cErik is the most dynamic defenseman there is,\u201d Brassard said. \u201cHe has really good vision, really offensive minded, and he also blocks a lot of shots. If you paired him and Ryan together, they would do well because Mac defends really well and skates really well. And he\u2019s also hard to play against.\u201d Senators defenseman Dion Phaneuf, a former captain with Toronto, said Karlsson\u2019s maturity was a crucial factor in the Senators\u2019 98-point regular season, during which Karlsson, 26, had 17 goals and 54 assists. Last season, Karlsson led the N.H.L. with 66 assists. \u201cHe\u2019s so consistent, that\u2019s the word I\u2019d use,\u201d said Phaneuf, 32, who relishes his supporting role for Ottawa\u2019s younger star. \u201cHe continues to be dangerous game after game. He logs the biggest minutes and plays the toughest matchups.\u201d McDonagh, 27, often does the same, and he has been effective in the playoffs alongside his longtime partner, Dan Girardi, both veterans of many Rangers spring runs. \u201cHe brought an edge to that whole series, let everyone around him know he was there, and I really loved that he wanted the puck,\u201d Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said of McDonagh\u2019s performance in the six-game win over Montreal in the first round. \u201cYou want guys who are difference makers.\u201d McDonagh, the 12th overall pick in 2007, has played seven N.H.L. seasons; Karlsson has played eight. Karlsson broke in as a 19-year-old, one year after the Senators drafted him 15th over all in 2008. McDonagh chose to compliment Karlsson instead of trying to dissect any contrasts between himself and the flashier Swede. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can compare us,\u201d McDonagh said. \u201cHe\u2019s a special player who plays a ton of minutes. He\u2019s a challenge every time you play him and he has the ability to put the puck into the net if he has the chance.\u201d Karlsson, who revealed this week that he battled a heel injury during the first-round series against Boston, which Ottawa won in six games, said his exploits took a back seat to the team\u2019s success. \u201cThis time of year, there\u2019s no hiding anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to push forward, and it\u2019s not going to be easy. I\u2019m taking care of my part and doing what I can to the best that possibly I can. I expect everybody to do the same. I feel we are on our way there.\u201d Forward Bobby Ryan, who has been with Ottawa for four seasons after playing six years with Anaheim, said he had seen Karlsson\u2019s leadership develop since he took the captain\u2019s mantle from Jason Spezza, who was traded to Dallas. \u201cHe almost tried too hard at first, felt he had to do everything himself,\u201d said Ryan, 30, who had four goals for the Senators in the first round after scoring 13 in the regular season. \u201cNow he\u2019s more vocal and demands the best out of everyone. He\u2019s going to demand that you are as passionate as he is.\u201d Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist, a fellow Swede, has been Karlsson\u2019s teammate in numerous international tournaments. Perhaps not wanting to add any fuel to the offensive firepower Karlsson brings each game, Lundqvist was succinct in his description. \u201cFunny guy and a great player,\u201d Lundqvist said. Karlsson\u2019s coach, Guy Boucher, made clear how much the captain means to his squad, which reached the second round for just the second time since reaching the finals in 2007. Ottawa lost to the Rangers in seven games in the first round in 2012, Karlsson\u2019s third season. \u201cI like that he\u2019s a guy with emotion; he\u2019s got torque,\u201d said Boucher, who became the Senators\u2019 coach last May. \u201cHe was all about the team from Day 1. That\u2019s where the maturity comes into play. Whenever you talk to him about an award or points, it\u2019s always deflected. I thought his leadership this year was a very clairvoyant one; he knew what to do and when.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/sports/hockey/stanley-cup-playoffs-new-york-rangers-ottawa-senators-erik-karlsson-ryan-mcdonagh.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T21:03:27-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T20:33:03-04:00", "abstract": "In a contrast in defensemen, Ottawa\u2019s Erik Karlsson is an offensive force known for his passing, while Ryan McDonagh has a more physical style.", "title": "Rangers and Senators Captains Lead by Different Examples"}
