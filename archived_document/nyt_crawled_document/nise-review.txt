{"text": "The territory couldn\u2019t be more delicate, but \u201cNise: The Heart of Madness,\u201d a mesmerizing drama from Brazil, navigates it skillfully to create a portrait of a real-life doctor who found an alternative to some of the more cruel trends in psychiatric treatment in the middle of the last century. Gl\u00f3ria Pires stars as Dr. Nise da Silveira (1905-1999), who as the film opens is taking up a post at a psychiatric hospital near Rio de Janeiro in 1944. She settles into a seat in a lecture hall where the benefits of lobotomies via thin spike are being extolled, then witnesses a cruel demonstration of another favorite technique, electroshock therapy. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in healing through violence,\u201d she tells colleagues, but, especially since she is a woman, they are dismissive. They assign her to what they think is busywork. She transforms the insult into opportunity, creating a unit in which patients who had been written off are given a chance to express themselves through painting and other art forms. The results are startling. The movie, full of characters behaving erratically, could easily have taken on the aura of a freak show, but the director, Roberto Berliner, somehow stays respectful of the subject matter even while depicting extreme psychiatric conditions. It\u2019s a study of courageous innovation against an entrenched medical orthodoxy. \u201cOur job is to cure patients, not comfort them,\u201d one colleague chastises. \u201cMy instrument is a brush,\u201d Dr. Silveira replies curtly. \u201cYours is an ice pick.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/nise-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:19:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:19:16-04:00", "abstract": "A drama from Brazil about a psychiatrist who defied medical orthodoxy and treated patients with paint brushes instead of spikes and electroshock therapy.", "title": "Review: \u2018Nise,\u2019 the Therapist Who Resisted Lobotomies"}
