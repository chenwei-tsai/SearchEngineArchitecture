{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Christopher J. Dodd, ending an uneven six-year tenure, will step down in September as chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America and will be succeeded as Hollywood\u2019s top lobbyist by Charles H. Rivkin, a former United States ambassador and assistant secretary of state. In announcing the change on Friday, the chiefs of Hollywood\u2019s six major studios lavished praise on Mr. Dodd, 72, who took over the movie organization after serving as a Democratic senator from Connecticut for three decades. \u201cHe helped create a fully integrated, global online antipiracy operation,\u201d Stacey Snider, chief executive of 20th Century Fox, said in a statement. Mr. Dodd was also credited with helping to gain distribution for Hollywood movies in China. China is likely to be Mr. Rivkin\u2019s initial focus. The studios are working to renegotiate Chinese rules that limit how many Hollywood movies are shown in the country each year. \u201cIf you ask these guys what their three major goals are, they will tell you China, China, China,\u201d Mr. Dodd said in a telephone interview, referring to studio executives. But Mr. Dodd, who plans to stay with the association until the end of the year to help with the transition, will also be remembered for two moments when the organization faltered. A major push in 2012 by copyright holders \u2014 including those represented by Mr. Dodd \u2014 for a tough federal law to control foreign online piracy collapsed in the face of stiff resistance from Google and other technology giants. Mr. Dodd had just taken over as the association\u2019s chief and had to adhere to legislation that forbade him from personally lobbying Congress for two years after leaving office, but the failure of the law, the Stop Online Piracy Act, became a black eye nonetheless. Mr. Dodd was also faulted for his handling of a 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. As hackers exposed thousands of emails and internal documents, Sony was left unassisted for a time, with Mr. Dodd unable to persuade executives at Hollywood\u2019s other major studios to offer public support. Sony threatened to withdraw from the organization over the episode, but ultimately remained a member. Sounding jovial and joking about no longer having to spar with the executive Harvey Weinstein over film ratings, Mr. Dodd said he was proud of his track record, particularly regarding online piracy. \u201cI wanted to leave the organization in a better place than I found it,\u201d he said, \u201cand I believe that is the case.\u201d Mr. Rivkin, 55, is a familiar face in show business. Before his government career, he ran the Jim Henson Company, the ancestral home of the Muppets. He was also the chief executive of Wildbrain Entertainment, known for producing the hit series \u201cYo Gabba Gabba!\u201d He was named United States ambassador to France in 2009 and later became the top State Department official for business and economic affairs under President Barack Obama. Despite his experience, Mr. Rivkin faces an arduous task at the association. The organization, which runs Hollywood\u2019s movie ratings system, has been weakened by budget cuts. All of the member studios are embedded within global media conglomerates, which employ their own lobbyists and often have competing interests. And when it comes to influence in Washington, Hollywood has been surpassed by Silicon Valley. \u201cIn today\u2019s digital world, the mission and function of the M.P.A.A. are more important than ever,\u201d Mr. Rivkin said in a statement. \u201cChris has done a great job, and I\u2019m excited to work with the member studios to continue to expand the global market for entertainment content, while ensuring creators\u2019 rights are respected around the world.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/media/chris-dodd-resign-mpaa.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T21:12:29-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T21:12:29-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Dodd, a former Democratic senator from Connecticut, will be succeeded in September as Hollywood\u2019s top lobbyist by Charles H.
