{"text": "Jesse Watters, the Fox News host who took heat this week for making a joke about Ivanka Trump that was criticized as lewd, said on Wednesday that he would be taking a family vacation until Monday. The move came just three days after his show began airing in a new high-profile time slot. Mr. Watters, who denied that his comment about President Trump\u2019s daughter was sexual, announced his upcoming absence near the end of Wednesday night\u2019s edition of \u201cThe Five.\u201d He will miss two days of the show\u2019s first week in prime time after it took over the 9 p.m. slot from \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d and he will miss his \u201cWatters\u2019 World\u201d show on Saturday. A Fox News spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the vacation had been planned before \u201cThe Five\u201d moved to its new time slot, or if the time off was related to the criticism Mr. Watters had received throughout much of Wednesday. Toward the end of Wednesday\u2019s hourlong show, Mr. Watters and his fellow hosts marveled at a wild baseball play in which a base runner leapt over the catcher to score a run, then he segued abruptly into his vacation announcement. \u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t run him over,\u201d Mr. Watters said. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m going to be taking a vacation with my family, so I\u2019m not going to be here tomorrow and Friday. But I\u2019ll be back on Monday, so try not to miss me too much.\u201d \u201cSaturday also?\u201d asked Kimberly Guilfoyle, a co-host. \u201cYes, and K.G. is going to be hosting \u2018Watters\u2019 World\u2019 on Saturday,\u201d he said, referring to Ms. Guilfoyle. Barely missing a beat, the focus then shifted to the birth of a two-toed sloth at the Memphis Zoo. Mr. Watters\u2019s highly scrutinized joke came during Tuesday\u2019s show as the hosts discussed footage of Ms. Trump being jeered on stage in Berlin while she was speaking on a panel about female entrepreneurship. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, the left says they really respect women, and then when given an opportunity to respect a woman like that, they boo and hiss,\u201d he said. Then he added with a grin: \u201cSo I don\u2019t really get what\u2019s going on here, but I really liked how she was speaking into that microphone.\u201d On Wednesday, after the clip had been shared widely on social media, Mr. Watters said in a statement that the comment had not been sexual innuendo, as critics perceived it to be. \u201cDuring the break we were commenting on Ivanka\u2019s voice and how it was low and steady and resonates like a smooth jazz radio DJ,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis was in no way a joke about anything else.\u201d It\u2019s an especially inopportune time for any whiff of sexism at Fox News. Mr. O\u2019Reilly, among the network\u2019s biggest stars,  left the network last week over accusations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. Its former chairman, Roger Ailes, was forced out last year after several female employees came forward with sexual harassment claims. Two more women, Julie Roginsky and Alisyn Camerota, lodged new complaints against Mr. Ailes this month. Mr. Watters, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. O\u2019Reilly, has ascended at Fox News despite occasionally attracting his own firestorms, including a heavily criticized segment in which he leaned on Asian stereotypes. In March, he scored an interview with President Trump.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/business/media/jesse-watters-ivanka-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T12:32:23-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T12:24:27-04:00", "abstract": "A Fox News spokeswoman would not say whether the vacation was planned before the host made what some saw as a lewd joke about Ms. Trump.", "title": "Jesse Watters of Fox Announces Vacation After Ivanka Trump Comment"}
