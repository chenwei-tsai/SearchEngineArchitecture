Harry B. Harris Jr., the head of the Pacific Command, told the House Armed Services Committee in a hearing on security challenges in the region. \u201cI\u2019ll take the hit for that.\u201d Admiral Harris ordered the Carl Vinson and three other warships earlier this month to cancel a port call to Australia and \u201csail north\u201d from Singapore into the western Pacific. An ill-timed news release by the Navy\u2019s Third Fleet created the impression that the carrier was headed north immediately, but in reality, it was steaming south to join the Australian navy in a secretive, truncated exercise in the Indian Ocean, 3,500 miles southwest of the Korean Peninsula. The confusing sequence of events \u2014 including a partially erroneous explanation later by the defense secretary, Jim Mattis \u2013 were only fully revealed about a week later when the Navy posted photographs of the carrier group steaming off the coast of Indonesia. The chain of errors surprised Admiral Harris\u2019s bosses at the Pentagon, upset edgy allies and caught the White House flat-footed \u2014 especially after President Trump asserted an \u201carmada\u201d was racing toward the impending crisis. By this week, the Carl Vinson had finally headed north and was conducting exercises with the Japanese navy in the Philippine Sea. Admiral Harris said the Carl Vinson \u2014 a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered carrier and its strike force, two destroyers and one cruiser \u2014 would continue steaming north, toward the Korean Peninsula, but did not specify exactly when it would be there. Other officials said it would likely arrive later this week. Asked how long it would take fighter jets aboard the Carl Vinson to reach North Korea from the ship\u2019s current location in the Philippine Sea, Admiral Harris said, \u201ctwo hours.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T12:04:22-04:00", "section": "World", "abstract": "Adm.
