A fixture as a game analyst at CBS for two decades, Simms will join \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d on the network for the coming season. Simms was recently replaced as CBS\u2019s top game analyst by Tony Romo after Romo, the longtime Cowboys quarterback, retired. Simms had been discussing the possibility of moving to \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d with CBS Sports President Sean McManus for several years. Simms has experience in a similar setting from his work on Showtime\u2019s \u201cInside The NFL.\u201d Simms said that McManus had expressed an interest in having him in the studio but that Simms had held off initially. \u201cI love doing the games, meeting during the week with coaches and players, getting the inside info,\u201d Simms said. \u201cIt is the best.\u201d He added, \u201cBut I also thought that I will work in New York and watch all the games instead of prepping for two teams, and will have all week to study the league, and that really intrigued me. \u201cThere are a lot of things I don\u2019t get to say on games I have a chance to say now. There are a lot of things I would like to talk about that I never would have talked about during games.\u201d Simms joins Boomer Esiason, Bill Cowher, Bart Scott and James Brown as part of the program. He said that he was more than comfortable with being part of that lineup and that he was looking forward to some pointed conversations among the group. \u201cJames and I get along really well,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh, \u201cOn \u2018Inside the NFL,\u2019 we\u2019re always playing footsie because I want him to send it back to me so I can challenge something someone said, or make a comment.\u201d He continued: \u201cBoomer and I have known each other for years, and we do not have thin skins, so we can say anything with each other. Of course, Coach Cowher, well, he\u2019s the coach, and we are going to disagree a lot because we were players and he was a coach.\u201d McManus is certain that will be the case. CBS was criticized over the Romo announcement, which seemed to have left Simms in the cold. But McManus said he believed that Simms, a former quarterback who was part of two Super Bowl-winning teams with the Giants, was entering a new and productive phase of his broadcasting career. \u201cWhen the news hit that Tony Gonzalez would not be back on the show, this seemed logical,\u201d McManus said. \u201cWe had a number of discussions about it, and I was excited about it, and he was excited.\u201d He added: \u201cThis will be good for viewers. Anyone who has watched just 30 seconds of \u2018Inside The NFL\u2019 will know that. One of the things I like best, Phil has strong opinions, but he has a way of doing it in a very respectful way. And you see the interaction they have on \u2018Inside The NFL.\u2019 It\u2019s really good stuff, a really good mix.\u201d The addition of Thursday night games to Simms\u2019s schedule made viewers wonder whether his workload had become too heavy. Simms disputed that, saying he felt last season was the best on Thursday nights for the network. \u201cA lot of people said it wore on me, and I am not going to say it physically was easy,\u201d Simms said. \u201cI told everyone over the years, man, when that game is ready to start, I never felt I was not completely prepared, and I couldn\u2019t wait for them to turn the camera on. \u201cSo that stuff is not true \u2014 it was never to the level where I couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d What about being absent from the broadcast booth after so many Sundays (and Thursday nights) behind the microphone? \u201cYeah, the excitement of just being there, hearing the crowd, the prep and talking to the coaches and players who are such a part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will probably get over that pretty quick.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/sports/football/phil-simms-joins-cbs-the-nfl-today.html", "section": "Sports"}
