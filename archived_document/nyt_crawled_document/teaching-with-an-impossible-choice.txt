An estimated 65 million people have been displaced by conflict. In 2000 Sasha Chanoff and Sheikha Ali, two humanitarian workers involved in a U.S. government rescue mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, faced a troubling choice. They couldn\u2019t help every refugee escape to safety, but could they try to help more than the 112 refugees on an approved government list? Mr. Chanoff stated in the film, \u201cThis was a list of life and death.\u201d What was their moral responsibility to the children and mothers they encountered during the mission who were in need of evacuation, but who weren\u2019t on the approved list? Should Mr. Chanoff and Ms. Ali risk the success of the entire operation to try to help even more refugees? This short documentary explores those difficult questions. Students 1.
