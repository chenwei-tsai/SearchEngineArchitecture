{"abstract": "Here\u2019s what you need to know to start your day.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "Good morning.  Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Call it the saga of the wayward warships. News that President Trump was sending a Navy strike force into the Sea of Japan last week fanned fears of a pre-emptive military strike on North Korea. But the ships were actually sailing in the opposite direction \u2014 a fact that only came to light after a photograph posted online by the Navy. The location of Vice President Mike Pence was more precise: He arrived in Japan to reiterate America\u2019s commitment to rein in North Korea. _____ \u2022 \u201cAs close as lips and teeth.\u201d That\u2019s how Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China, once described his country\u2019s relationship with North Korea. But there is renewed debate over China\u2019s longstanding patronage of its unpredictable neighbor after Shen Zhihua, a well-known Chinese historian, gave a speech on the issue last month. Here are some excerpts. We also examined what North Korea\u2019s recent military parade revealed about its rapidly growing capabilities. _____ \u2022 Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister of Australia, above left, said he was \u201cputting Australians first\u201d as he announced plans to replace a special visa category that allows entry to some temporary foreign workers. President Trump is tackling changes to visas, too: He is expected to sign an order aimed at making it harder for technology companies to recruit low-wage workers from foreign countries. _____ \u2022 As President Trump nears 100 days in the White House, he has shown that while he won office on a populist message, he has drifted away from some of the anti-establishment ideas that animated his campaign. And his campaign promise to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris climate deal? Mr. Trump\u2019s most influential policy advisers are now urging him to keep the United States in the 2015 accord. His efforts to overhaul the U.S. tax code are also in serious jeopardy. _____ \u2022  Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain called for snap elections in a bid to strengthen her hand before what promises to be tough negotiations on her country\u2019s exit from the European Union. The vote, scheduled for June 8, carries political risks for Ms. May, but analysts generally praised the decision. _____ \u2022 And in Indonesia, voters will choose the next governor of Jakarta, the capital, after a campaign that a local newspaper called \u201cthe dirtiest, most polarizing and most divisive the nation has ever seen.\u201d Opinion surveys indicate it will be a close race between the incumbent Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, known as Ahok, and Anies Baswedan, a former minister who is Muslim. \u2022 Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion brand seems undeterred by her White House job. China and Japan recently approved her trademarks, and dozens more are pending around the world. \u2022 The International Monetary Fund raised its global growth outlook to 3.5 percent this year, partly because of increased international trade. \u2022  Vijay Mallya, the Indian tycoon who called himself the King of Good Times, was arrested in London and is facing extradition. \u2022 The Samsung Galaxy S8 will be in stores soon, but our tech expert advises waiting to buy the $750 smartphone \u2014 and not just because of safety concerns over the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. \u2022 U.S. stocks were down. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Steve Stephens, the man suspected of posting a video to Facebook in which he killed a passer-by, shot himself when police in Pennsylvania attempted to pull him over, the authorities said. [The New York Times] \u2022 In France, two men were detained over a plot to disrupt the presidential election. The interior minister said they were \u201csuspected of wanting to imminently commit a violent action.\u201d [The New York Times] \u2022 The family of Laeticia Brouwer, a teenage surfer who was killed by a shark in Australia this week, said she died doing something she loved. [ABC] \u2022 China\u2019s Communist Party warned its members not to cross \u201cred lines\u201d on WeChat, a social media platform. Sharing pornography and disparaging party policies were among eight behaviors listed. [South China Morning Post] \u2022 A former Taipei city official admitted to beheading a bronze statue of a Yoichi Hatta, a Japanese engineer in the colonial era. [The Asahi Shimbun] \u2022 The first-ever living specimen of a giant shipworm, which eats mud and can grow to five feet long, was discovered in the Philippines. [BBC] \u2022 Here\u2019s a reminder that improving your health and fitness doesn\u2019t take much time \u2014 four minutes, in fact, is enough. \u2022 Trouble sleeping? Try replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Skip the sad pasta salad, and try one that is packed with roasted eggplant, chile and mint. \u2022 A Times reporter in Iraq attended an Easter service in one of the Christian towns near Mosul that has been hit hardest by the Islamic State. Soldiers with automatic weapons stood sentry on the roof. \u2022 The first woman to enter the Boston Marathon in 1967, Kathrine Switzer, ran it again on Monday at 70. This time, she didn\u2019t have to hide her gender to register and no one tried to force her off the course. \u2022 Finally, a dragon\u2019s blood potion from the fairy tales: Biochemists found that blood  from a Komodo dragon yielded molecules that kill bacteria and heal wounds. When the New England Patriots visit the White House today to celebrate the team\u2019s Super Bowl victory, several players will be missing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\u201d said LeGarrette Blount, above right. The missing players won\u2019t be the first to decline a White House visit. The Patriots\u2019s Tom Brady skipped the last time the team won the Super Bowl, in 2015, citing family commitment. Larry Bird didn\u2019t show when the Boston Celtics visited the Reagan White House in 1984. \u201cIf the president wants to see me, he knows where to find me,\u201d Mr. Bird said. The tradition of sports teams visiting the White House dates to at least 1865, when President Andrew Johnson welcomed two amateur baseball teams. The first championship team believed to have visited didn\u2019t have to travel very far: the Washington Senators, after winning the 1924 World Series. Even Canadian teams have visited. After the Toronto Blue Jays won the 1992 World Series, President George Bush invited the team. \u201cAmerica is proud of you,\u201d he told the team\u2019s coach. _____ Evan Gershkovich contributed reporting.
