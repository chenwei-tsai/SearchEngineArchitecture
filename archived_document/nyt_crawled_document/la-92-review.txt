{"text": "Even though the 1992 Los Angeles riots took place long before the spread of camera phones, they were captured on video from the beginning, or at least from the event that lit the spark: the beating of Rodney G. King by Los Angeles police officers. \u201cLA 92,\u201d one of several documentaries being released to commemorate the riots\u2019 25th anniversary, takes advantage of the wealth of broadcast and helicopter footage available to assemble a chronological account with a present-tense feel. The movie, which opens theatrically on Friday and airs on the National Geographic channel on Sunday, begins and ends by drawing a parallel with the 1965 Watts riots, which the news media addressed in strikingly similar language. Apart from overbearing music \u2014 the lead-in to the first day of the riots is scored with an orchestra tuning up \u2014 the film mostly lets the archival footage speak for itself. It\u2019s still shocking to see these scenes, both from before the Rodney King verdict (Chief Daryl Gates of the Los Angeles Police Department telling City Council members that if they don\u2019t offer support, the department \u201cis not going to be the kind of department that you want\u201d) and after (a man with a coffee cup walking by smoldering wreckage; Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat, calming a crowd outside a post office as the riots ebb). The directors, Dan Lindsay and T. J. Martin, won an Oscar for the humdrum high school football documentary \u201cUndefeated,\u201d and while they haven\u2019t constructed a sociological take on race relations in Los Angeles as sophisticated as \u201cO. J.: Made in America,\u201d they have made a taut and commanding primer.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/la-92-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:22:33-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:22:33-04:00", "abstract": "This documentary, one of several commemorating the riots\u2019 25th anniversary, assembles broadcast and helicopter footage into a taut chronological account.", "title": "Review: In \u2018LA 92,\u2019 the Los Angeles Riots Feel Like Today\u2019s News"}
