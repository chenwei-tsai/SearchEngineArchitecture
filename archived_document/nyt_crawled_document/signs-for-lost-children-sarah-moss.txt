Paper, $19. In an era when Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, encourages young women to lean in to paid work and Damien Chazelle uses his film \u201cLa La Land\u201d to portray the sacrifices lovers must make to pursue their artistic goals, the British writer Sarah Moss shows how little the concerns that rise from the intersection of work and love have changed over the last century. Her latest novel, \u201cSigns for Lost Children,\u201d offers a vivid psychological portrait of a woman doctor, Ally Moberly, whose efforts to help those struggling with mental illness in Victorian England are complicated by her own neuroses. In depicting Ally\u2019s marriage to an architect and engineer named Tom Cavendish, Moss raises significant questions about our modern sensibilities, our attitudes toward the competing pulls of work and love among husbands and wives. Moss\u2019s novel returns readers to a character from an earlier book, \u201cBodies of Light.\u201d There we came to know Ally Moberly, whose father is a successful painter and whose mother is a religious zealot devoted to the poor of Manchester yet haunted by the death of Ally\u2019s sister May. As this new novel opens, it is the late 1870s and Ally, a pioneer in the male-dominated medical profession, has just met ginger-haired Tom, who has risen from a working-class background to work for a company building lighthouses throughout the world. After she graduates and becomes a doctor, they are married, but six weeks later his employer sends him to far-off Japan. In chapters that move back and forth between them, we follow Tom on his Asian travels and Ally in Cornwall, where she works in an insane asylum whose female patients are treated with horrifyingly primitive methods. Tom\u2019s experiences in an alien culture and Ally\u2019s travails in England are juxtaposed, allowing the reader to join them on their separate quests even as their nascent marriage is shaped by their separate concerns. As a stylist, Moss deploys an arresting third-person stream-of-consciousness perspective to great effect, affording the reader a better understanding of her characters, particularly the very private Ally. \u201cYou chose the asylum,\u201d she tells herself, \u201cbecause you indulge yourself in feeblemindedness. Because despite all your training and all your so-called qualifications, you are still crazed.\u201d By employing brief chapters and a vibrant present tense \u2014 \u201cRain scrabbles on the roof and the fire hisses and shifts. In the kitchen, cups and bowls chime as water pours and the maids\u2019 voices rise and fall\u201d \u2014 Moss makes a novel rooted in the past feel contemporary. Ally and Tom are highly educated people who are fortunate enough to follow their callings. Yet Moss shows how they must recognize that their work inevitably changes them. As Ally attempts to study the treatment of mental illness in an era when the allegedly insane are left to molder in abusive institutions, she begins to regress herself, recalling harsh memories of life with her relentlessly ascetic mother and neglectful father and the tragic loss of her sister. In contrast, Tom\u2019s mission abroad \u2014 to bring Western engineering to a nation attempting to modernize while also fulfilling a lucrative commission to buy exotic wares for a buccaneering businessman \u2014 transforms him from a provincial Englishman who spurns \u201cslimy\u201d Japanese sweets to a wanderlust-afflicted vagabond obsessed with \u201cfox possession\u201d myths who \u201cdoes not want to go home.\u201d In this fine exploration of marriage and the complex minds of \u201clost children\u201d \u2014 that is, all of us \u2014 Moss mines and assesses a union of gifted individuals who follow their paths with great determination, unaware that their hearts will surely be changed in the process.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T06:00:25-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/signs-for-lost-children-sarah-moss.html", "item_type": "Article"}
