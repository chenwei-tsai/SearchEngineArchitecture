{"text": "Frederick Wiseman\u2019s judgment of what\u2019s wrong with ballet is far from crazy. That esteemed filmmaker, having directed his inquisitive gaze on American Ballet Theater and Paris Opera Ballet in documentaries, has expressed dissatisfaction with the narrow subject matter of most ballets: the fairy tales, the antique love stories, the avoidance of contemporary life. That\u2019s an old complaint, long shared by ballet insiders, experts and reformers. Mr. Wiseman\u2019s proposed treatment, though, is extreme, almost the equivalent of electroshock therapy. As a fellow with the Center for Ballet and the Arts, he suggested a ballet based on \u201cTiticut Follies,\u201d his notorious 1967 documentary about a state prison for the criminally insane. It\u2019s easy to imagine how that idea could go offensively wrong. But James Sewell, a Minneapolis-based choreographer, bravely took up the challenge, and at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts last weekend, his company gave the New York premiere of his \u201cTiticut Follies: The Ballet.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a disaster. That\u2019s too strong a word for a work this mild. The ballet borrows scenes and figures from the film, sensibly starting and ending with the part that\u2019s already theatrical, the inmate-and-staff musical revue that gives the documentary its title. This introduction of artifice is a hopeful sign, since so much of the film\u2019s power isn\u2019t transferable: the sad setting; the close-ups; above all, the ambiguity and shock of fact. The ballet has to rely on the powers of ballet. One of Mr. Sewell\u2019s methods is to draw on dance history. He recasts the film\u2019s humiliating strip search as the famous \u201cKingdom of the Shades\u201d entrance in \u201cLa Bayad\u00e8re,\u201d with its infinity mirror of ballerinas. This is clever, setting that idealized beauty in tension with the rudeness of rectal inspections. But the concept, by not developing, becomes tedious rather than disturbing, and the choice to stop short of actual nakedness seems a failure of nerve. Both of those shortcomings prove typical. The ballet\u2019s boldest scene shows us something the film can\u2019t. After Lenny Pickett\u2019s score samples an inmate\u2019s bewildered vocal confession to sexually abusing his own child, Mr. Sewell gives us a creepy father-daughter pas de deux. Here, the stylization of ballet allows it to represent, with disturbing clarity, something that a naturalistic approach would likely shy away from or blur. At the same time, the heinousness of the act implicates the form in which it\u2019s presented: the manipulative, splayed-leg duets that are troublingly ubiquitous in ballet. After this, they all feel ickier. For the most part, though, the multiple allusions to canonical ballets feel gratuitous \u2014 ingenious but discrete, like many of the production\u2019s ideas. And that\u2019s a more significant flaw than the nearly unavoidable awkwardness of less-than-extraordinary actors pretending to be mentally disturbed. The work\u2019s true disappointment lies in how it misses the big opportunity of the uncommon subject matter to force ballet into some new expressiveness. Between that deficiency of invention and the proliferation of self-references, \u201cTiticut Follies\u201d makes ballet seem more self-absorbed than ever, a condition you could diagnose as narcissism.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/dance/review-titicut-follies-tries-to-deliver-a-shock-to-ballet.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T15:50:02-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T15:50:02-04:00", "abstract": "Turning Frederick Wiseman\u2019s documentary about the criminally insane into a dance doesn\u2019t force ballet into new expressiveness.", "title": "Review: \u2018Titicut Follies\u2019 Tries to Deliver a Shock to Ballet"}
