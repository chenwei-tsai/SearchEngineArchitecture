{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cRattled by Trump Policies, Scientists Take to Streets\u201d (news article, April 23): These marches focused on the consequences of the proposed large cuts in the budgets of federal agencies that support fundamental scientific research. This research provides fundamental understanding of the processes that advance medical treatment, an example being the development of a vaccine against the Zika virus. Such research leads to understanding of basic science and engineering at the atomic level, leading to technical innovation and invention, and inevitably drives growth of the economy. Government support of basic research over the last 70 years has brought to this country the best minds from abroad. Thus, support of basic research in the biological, chemical and physical sciences is one of the best investments we can make. As an indicator, from World War II through 2016, the United States has won 48 percent more Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and economics than any other country. Cutting of basic science budgets will inevitably lead to national mediocrity. WILLIAM A. CRAMERWEST LAFAYETTE, IND.
