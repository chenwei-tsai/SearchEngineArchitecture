{"text": "\u2022 This year\u2019s Tony Awards nominations will be announced at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday from the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. The announcement can be viewed on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d at tonyawards.com, and on NY1. \u2022 Don\u2019t expect a \u201cHamilton\u201d-like sweep. That musical dominated the last awards season, garnering a record 16  nominations (and going on to win 11). This season, no single show has commanded the same attention or acclaim, and honors are likely to be spread around. \u2022 Expect the old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing revival of \u201cHello, Dolly!,\u201d starring Bette Midler in the title role, to score big. Among new musicals, keep a close eye on the tear-jerking \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d and the 9/11-themed \u201cCome From Away.\u201d \u2022 Not everyone will be smiling today, as the nominations come at the end of an unusually full \u2014 and competitive \u2014 Broadway season. Angling for recognition are 13 new musicals, 10 new plays, nine play revivals and five musical revivals. And the awards often mean money at the box office. \u2022 The prizes will be awarded at 8 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday, June 11, during a ceremony at Radio City Musical Hall, much of which will be broadcast on CBS. Kevin Spacey will host. Some 840 producers, investors, performers and others who work in the theater choose the winners. Competition for Broadway\u2019s big prizes will be hard-fought and harder to predict. We\u2019ll have all the news right here as it\u2019s announced, so keep checking back for the list of nominees, commentary by our critics and reaction from the artists. Two heart-wrenching musicals \u2014 \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d about an anxiety-ridden adolescent who insinuates himself into the life of a grieving family, and \u201cCome From Away,\u201d about a Canadian town that sheltered stranded travelers after the terrorist attacks of 2001 \u2014 are expected to be the leading candidates for best new musical, the most coveted prize with the biggest box office impact. The race for best new play appears to be wide open, but the odds are the winner will be an American writer making his or her Broadway debut \u2014 good news for those who care about the visibility and viability of new American plays. There were 37 Tony-eligible plays and musicals on Broadway this season, but two performances have been the indisputable must-sees: 23-year-old Ben Platt in a devastating star-is-born turn as a decompensating adolescent in \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d and 71-year-old Bette Midler in a delirious career-capping turn as a meddlesome matchmaker in \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d They are pretty well assured to be nominated for awards on Tuesday, he as best leading actor in a musical, she as best leading actress in a musical. Can either of them be beat? Ms. Midler seems like a lock. The reviews were nearly unanimous in their praise, despite some concerns about the quality of her singing voice; audiences have been worshipful and are paying top dollar to see her (premium seats are being sold for $748). Two much-honored Broadway mainstays, Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole, could face off in the awards derby for playing the rival cosmetics executives Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden in \u201cWar Paint.\u201d There were also some promising debuts \u2014 Den\u00e9e Benton in \u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812\u201d and Eva Noblezada in \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d \u2014 and some early career standouts \u2014 Christy Altomare in \u201cAnastasia,\u201d Laura Osnes in \u201cBandstand\u201d and Phillipa Soo in \u201cAm\u00e9lie.\u201d Mr. Platt has been universally acclaimed, and has accomplished the rare feat of creating an original role that speaks to young people. His main challenger is expected to be Andy Karl, who stars as the caddish weatherman Phil Connors in \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d Mr. Karl\u2019s magnetic performance has come to seem almost heroic, given that he tore his anterior cruciate ligament three days before the show opened and is performing in a knee brace. Other men to watch in lead roles: the pop singer Josh Groban, wowing critics and fans with his Broadway debut in \u201cGreat Comet,\u201d the television star David Hyde Pierce, daffy and winning as the feed store owner in \u201cHello, Dolly!,\u201d and Jon Jon Briones, the scheming Engineer in \u201cMiss Saigon.\u201d The unknown back story of a Middle East peace pact. The impact of deindustrialization on manufacturing workers in Pennsylvania. The ill-fated journey to Broadway of a Yiddish play with a lesbian subplot. And an imagined sequel to a great 19th-century drama. Each of the expected contenders for the best new play Tony marks the writer\u2019s Broadway debut \u2014 and each of the playwrights is American. Brits will not dominate this prestigious category this year. The front-runners are likely to be \u201cOslo,\u201d by J. T. Rogers, an unexpectedly crackling drama about a Norwegian couple who helped broker the 1993 Middle East peace accords, and \u201cSweat,\u201d by Lynn Nottage, which depicts the impact of a declining manufacturing plant on friends and family in Reading, Pa. Not to be counted out: \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d by Lucas Hnath, which was the last show of the season to open, and did so to uniformly positive reviews, and \u201cIndecent,\u201d by the Pulitzer-winning playwright Paula Vogel, which reconstructs the controversy over \u201cThe God of Vengeance,\u201d which opened on Broadway in 1922. The last Broadway season \u2014 the one with \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cAllegiance\u201d \u2014 was widely celebrated for its diversity, and all four acting awards for musicals went to black actors. This season, the successes were less flashy, but still noteworthy. \u201cJitney,\u201d the only one of August Wilson\u2019s 10-play Century Cycle never before staged on Broadway, was given a sterling production by the Manhattan Theater Club. The playwright, the director and the entire cast were African-American. Ms. Nottage, an African-American playwright who was unable to get \u201cRuined,\u201d her play about rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to Broadway, this year got there with \u201cSweat.\u201d The play\u2019s critical reception was mixed, but it won Ms. Nottage a second Pulitzer Prize. And a revival of \u201cMiss Saigon,\u201d with a predominantly Asian-American cast, served as a reminder of how much attitudes toward casting have changed: The leading role of the Engineer, controversially originated by a white British actor, Jonathan Pryce, in 1991, has since been played by actors of Asian heritage, and the revival stars a Filipino-American, Mr. Briones, who was in the original British ensemble. Once the nominations are announced, it\u2019s up to the voters. Over the next five weeks, they must finish seeing all the nominated shows, and then have until 6 p.m., June 9, to submit their ballots. Who are the voters? About 840 people cast ballots \u2014 theater investors and producers, as well as actors, directors, designers, journalists and others whose financial or professional lives intersect with Broadway. Many of them have financial interests in one or more of the nominated productions. There is campaigning, of a sort. Producers send glossy souvenir books, and often compendiums of positive reviews, to remind voters of what they\u2019ve seen, and some send gag gifts as well. Shows that opened in the fall \u2014 \u201cThe Great Comet\u201d and \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d for example \u2014 invite voters who attended months ago to see them again. Nominees, meanwhile, show up or perform at gala fund-raisers for nonprofit organizations that have Tony voters in the crowd. And there is an invariable battle for press coverage as well. A few folks can start making room on their shelves now. The Tony Awards administration committee announced Thursday that James Earl Jones, a two-time Tony winner (for \u201cThe Great White Hope\u201d and \u201cFences\u201d) will be given a special Tony for lifetime achievement in the theater. Baayork Lee, an actress, choreographer and director best known as a member of the original cast of \u201cA Chorus Line,\u201d will receive the Isabelle Stevenson Tony Award, which honors volunteerism, in recognition of her work with the with the National Asian Artists Project, which she founded. Dallas Theater Center will receive the regional theater Tony Award, and two longtime general managers, Nina Lannan and Alan Wasser, will receive Tony Honors for Excellence in the Theater. And a special Tony for sound design will be presented to Gareth Fry and Pete Malkin for their work on Simon McBurney\u2019s one-man show, \u201cThe Encounter.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/theater/tony-awards-nominations.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T05:00:33-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T05:00:33-04:00", "abstract": "The nominations will be announced at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday.
