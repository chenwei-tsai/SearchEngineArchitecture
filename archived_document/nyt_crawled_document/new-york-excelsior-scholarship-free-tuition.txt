{"text": "PURCHASE, N.Y. \u2014 For its recent accepted-students day, Purchase College, part of the State University of New York, had the usual array of inducements aimed at persuading admitted high school seniors to attend, including tours, sample classes and a jazz trio serenading families during lunch. But it also had a potent new weapon: New York State\u2019s Excelsior Scholarship, which this year will offer free tuition at the state\u2019s public colleges and universities for in-state students from households earning up to $100,000. At Purchase, a four-year liberal arts college, and other SUNY schools, it is worth close to $6,500. The program is the first in the nation to offer free tuition at a state\u2019s two- and four-year publicly funded schools. It was enacted just weeks before the May 1 deadline for most students to decide where they will matriculate, a choice that for many families involves weighing one school\u2019s financial aid package against another\u2019s. Though it is still too early to know how the program will shape college attendance in the state, if Purchase\u2019s accepted-students day was any indication, the promise of free tuition seemed a powerful lure for students and parents considering New York\u2019s public campuses. That was the case for Jasmine Yanase, who would qualify for the Excelsior program and was choosing between Purchase, which has a national reputation for its programs in the fine and performing arts, and the private Mannes School of Music (part of the New School). At Mannes, where tuition is about $45,000 a year, she had been offered $15,000 in financial aid. With Excelsior, Jasmine, a violinist and senior at the Bronx High School of Science, could afford to live on Purchase\u2019s campus in Westchester County, where room, board and fees ran just under $15,000 this year. Though she would commute from home to Mannes, Purchase would still be cheaper. \u201cI\u2019m definitely in love with this school,\u201d Jasmine said after finishing a tour of Purchase\u2019s campus. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting to see if Mannes is worth the money.\u201d Parents, too, at Purchase were warming to the idea of free tuition. Harry Martinian of Elmont said he and his wife, Anna, had expected to \u201cshell out a considerable amount of money\u201d for their son Otto\u2019s tuition. An aspiring lighting designer, Otto was also accepted at Adelphi University, a private school where tuition would run about $15,000 a year after financial aid was factored in. Like Jasmine, he could not afford to live on campus at the private college. Before the Excelsior program, Otto was counting on $3,000 in financial aid from state and federal sources toward tuition at Purchase, currently $6,470. Now, the new program would fill in the remaining gap. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief,\u201d Otto said. The family had no problem with the requirement that program participants live and work in-state for a number of years equal to how long they received the scholarship money, or have it convert to a loan. \u201cThis is smart government because it keeps the talent where it belongs,\u201d Mr. Martinian said in reference to the residency requirement. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has made Excelsior the centerpiece of his middle-class agenda, saying it will \u201cmake college accessible to thousands of working and middle class students\u201d who might otherwise not be able to afford to attend. The program\u2019s passage was hailed by Hillary Clinton, among others, for opening up college opportunities, but critics have complained that it does little to ease the college burden for the state\u2019s poorest students. (By 2019, the income cap for the scholarship will rise to $125,000.) Some have argued that the tens of millions of dollars allotted for the program this year should be used instead to help low-income students pay for room and board, which is generally not covered by existing state and federal financial-aid programs. Others faulted the scholarship\u2019s stringent eligibility requirements, including full-time enrollment and the need to stay in the state after graduation. Still others worried that the program would siphon students from New York\u2019s private colleges, putting their financial viability in jeopardy. At Purchase, college officials estimated that 2,100 of the 4,000 undergraduates, including incoming freshmen and returning students, would qualify for the Excelsior scholarship, which is designed to fill the gaps of tuition costs not covered by financial aid. Dennis Craig, the college\u2019s vice president for student affairs and enrollment management, estimated that two-thirds of those 2,100 students also would qualify for the state\u2019s Tuition Assistance Program and federal Pell grants, meaning the Excelsior money would be the \u201clast dollar\u201d and cover whatever the other programs did not. The remaining students would not have received any aid in previous years because their family\u2019s earnings would have left them ineligible for tuition assistance or Pell grants. Now the state will pay their tuition. \u201cThey would be taking out loans ordinarily,\u201d Mr. Craig said. \u201cThey are people pretty close to the top of the income bracket.\u201d The program, which was announced after students had been accepted, added an unexpected variable into carefully worked out equations colleges use to estimate how many students will accept offers of admission. Too few students and a college comes up short on revenue. Too many and three students are suddenly squeezing into dorm rooms meant for two. \u201cAs an enrollment manager, I worry about everything,\u201d Mr. Craig said. \u201cWe put our best foot forward and select a class that we think is good fit for the college and the student. Then there is a piece of this that is a little bit a roll of the dice.\u201d Stephanie McCaine, the college\u2019s director of admissions, anticipated that the program would have a more decisive effect next year, since news of the program broke well after application season. The college is hoping for a final head count of about 760 freshmen this fall. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much we can do to control human behavior, and there are many other factors that go into a decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will overwhelm us.\u201d Dozens of students called the college to find out about the program in the days after it was enacted, and on accepted-students day a good chunk of a panel on financial aid was devoted to explaining how it would work. The state\u2019s Higher Education Services Corporation is preparing an Excelsior application that should be ready by the end of May, and students will be notified after that. Jacob Ebel of Hudson, who plans to study guitar and psychology, admitted that the prospect of a tuition-free college experience was seductive. He would qualify for the Excelsior scholarship, but if he became a professional musician after graduating, he might not want to be tied to New York. \u201cThat sort of freaks me out,\u201d he said, adding that the cost of college was nonetheless a \u201cbig factor in my decision.\u201d Jacob was deciding among several SUNY schools and Ithaca College, a private school where financial aid would cut the cost of tuition, room and board in half, to about $30,000 a year. For his parents, Bill and Janet Ebel, who have put two older children through college, the cost difference is significant. Mr. Ebel, a building contractor and teacher who attended Princeton University, said the new state tuition program was \u201cvery attractive.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d said Mrs. Ebel, a mortgage broker. \u201cWe\u2019re in that sweet spot where we don\u2019t make $250,000 a year and we don\u2019t qualify for free giveaways, either. We are the epitome of New York\u2019s middle class.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/nyregion/new-york-excelsior-scholarship-free-tuition.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T00:01:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T00:01:24-04:00", "abstract": "The new Excelsior Scholarship, for use at the state\u2019s public campuses, is \u201chuge\u201d for qualifying in-state families when weighed against the costs of private colleges.", "title": "Free Tuition in New York Adds Powerful Pull at Decision Deadline"}
