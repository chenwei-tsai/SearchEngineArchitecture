{"abstract": "D.J. Taylor\u2019s clever and timely work contends that the world would be a poorer place without a bit of insolence and ostentation.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "The English writer William Golding (\u201cLord of the Flies\u201d) had a longstanding sense of social inadequacy. When he applied to Oxford University, the admissions interviewer noted that he was \u201cN.T.S.\u201d \u2014 not top shelf. Golding wrote that he would like to sneak up on Eton, the elite private school, as if he were a cartoon villain, \u201cwith a mile or two of wire, a few hundred tons of TNT and one of those plunger-detonating machines which makes the user feel like Jehovah.\u201d There\u2019s no sting like a class sting. There\u2019s a bit of Golding, an imagined status-anarchist, in most of us. Who doesn\u2019t hate snobs? Yet we\u2019re all snobs about some things. It\u2019s among the contentions of D. J. Taylor\u2019s clever and timely \u201cThe New Book of Snobs\u201d that the world would be a poorer place without a bit of insolence and ostentation. \u201cThe cultivation of an arbitrary superiority,\u201d he writes \u2014 whether we are in a refugee camp or a manor house \u2014 \u201cis a vital part of the curious behavioral compound that makes us who we are.\u201d Often enough, you\u2019d need a hydraulic rescue tool, a Jaws of Life, to pry apart snobbery from a simple human desire to get ahead. As Taylor puts it, \u201cnot all social aspiration is snobbish\u201d and \u201cto want to succeed and to delight in your success is not necessarily to betray a moral failing.\u201d Taylor\u2019s book takes its title and inspiration from William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s \u201cThe Book of Snobs\u201d (1848), in which that Victorian novelist defined a snob as one \u201cwho meanly admires mean things.\u201d Snobbery is no longer so easy to define. As in a string of binary code, the ones and zeros keep flipping. In a world in which reverse snobbery is often the cruelest sort, it can be hard for the tyro to keep up. This is where Taylor\u2019s book comes in. \u201cThe New Book of Snobs\u201d will not help you navigate the American status system. It\u2019s a very British book; so British that there are currently no plans to publish it in the United States. (I\u2019m reviewing it because it\u2019s new and interesting, and because copies can be easily found online.) To understand Taylor fully, it will help to be conversant with the humor magazine Viz, as well as with the humor magazine Punch; with the reality-TV star Katie Price as well as with the writer Nancy Mitford; and with the Kray twins and the rapper Tinie Tempah, as well as with Evelyn Waugh and Beau Brummell. Writing is hard because thinking is hard. Writing about class and snobbery, in particular, is so hard that doing it well bumps you a rung up the class ladder. In America, no one has made a serious attempt to unpick the multiple meanings of status cues since Paul Fussell did in his wicked book \u201cClass\u201d (1983). As a myriad-minded social critic, Taylor is not quite on Fussell\u2019s level. (Almost no human is.) But he\u2019s astute, supremely well read and frequently very funny. In its combination of impact with effervescence, his book puts me in mind of a Black Velvet, that curious cocktail made from Guinness stout and champagne. The English class system, with its hereditary titles, is vastly different from ours. But snobbery \u2014 class\u2019s meddlesome twin \u2014 is a lingua franca. There\u2019s plenty for an attentive student to learn here. We are in the age of Trump, and, clearly, some forms of attempted snobbery will always take the form of conspicuous consumption. Taylor correctly points out, however, that the wiliest snobs \u201cpursue their craft by stealth.\u201d He\u2019s excellent on the distinctions that can be conveyed \u201cby an agency as subtle as an undone button, a gesture, a glance, an intonation, the pronunciation of a certain word.\u201d In England, it\u2019s possible to be crushed by the sound of an attenuated vowel. Americans in Britain, Taylor suggests, must remain on alert. Upper-class Brits like to ridicule American vernacular by stressing our usages, as in (the italics are his) \u201cI think she\u2019s gone to the restroom,\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019ll have to take a rain check on that.\u201d Don\u2019t think you can escape this sort of game. \u201cThe man who most loudly proclaims his lack of snobbishness,\u201d Taylor writes, \u201cis most likely to be a snob.\u201d Taylor\u2019s book is filled with small, tart taxonomies. He lists the great snob heroes of fiction, including Lady Catherine de Bourgh in \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d He offers tidy profiles of notable snobs, including the journalist and politician Tom Driberg (1905-1976), who would write the managers of hotels in advance, \u201cdemanding an assurance that there would be no sauce bottles or other condiments on the dining tables during his stay.\u201d The author probes some of the class resentment behind Brexit, Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. President Trump is not mentioned in this book. But leaning on George Orwell and Charles Dickens, Taylor discusses nationalism as \u201can extreme form of snobbery.\u201d A great deal of strong writing about class has been emerging from Britain in recent years. I\u2019m thinking, in particular, of Owen Jones\u2019s book \u201cChavs: The Demonization of the Working Class\u201d (2011). Taylor\u2019s book is vastly different from Jones\u2019s, but, in a sense, these men are climbing the same mountain from different sides. To linger on the topic of class can seem like a sign of a sick soul. The subject can make us touchy, whether we are highborn or low or someplace in the middle. The critic Dwight Macdonald was a man of the radical left, yet a descendant of the old Dwight family of New England. In one grouchy 1947 letter, he wrote, \u201cWe can\u2019t all be proletarians, you know.\u201d With nearly all status signifiers in flux, books like Taylor\u2019s are more important than ever. Snobbery and immense learning, he makes plain, do not always walk hand in hand. But in 2017, it pays to heed the advice of Ian McEwan, who wrote: \u201cIt is quite impossible these days to assume anything about people\u2019s educational level from the way they talk or dress or from their taste in music. Safest to treat everyone you meet as a distinguished intellectual.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/books/review-new-book-of-snobs-dj-taylor.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T15:49:02-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "\u2018The New Book of Snobs\u2019 Updates the Shifting Science of Social Cues", "created_date": "2017-04-18T15:49:02-04:00", "section": "Books"}
