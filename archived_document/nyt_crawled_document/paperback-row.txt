{"section": "Books", "text": "Six new paperbacks to check out this week. A RAGE FOR ORDER: THE MIDDLE EAST IN TURMOIL, FROM TAHRIR SQUARE TO ISIS, by Robert F. Worth. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) A masterly account of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, and the region\u2019s decline into violence and anarchy, by a former New York Times foreign correspondent. Our reviewer, Kenneth M. Pollack, called the book \u201ca marvel of storytelling, with the chapters conjuring a poignancy fitting for the subject.\u201d THE MIRROR THIEF, by Martin Seay. (Melville House, $17.99.) Linked narratives brimming with delightful, esoteric detail unfold in three Venices: 16th-century Italy; 1950s Venice Beach, Calif.; and the Venetian casino in Las Vegas in 2003. A card counter, the man hired to track him down and an oblique book of poems weave through a series of schemes in this novel, with a structure that recalls David Mitchell\u2019s \u201cCloud Atlas.\u201d FREE SPEECH: TEN PRINCIPLES FOR A CONNECTED WORLD, by Timothy Garton Ash. (Yale University, $22.) Protected speech is under siege on a wide front and is caught up in a number of modern controversies, from the role of government surveillance to the criminalization of hate speech and the prosecution of whistle-blowers. Garton Ash examines 10 such cases, framed with his call for \u201cmore free speech but also better speech.\u201d THE NEST, by Cynthia D\u2019Aprix Sweeney. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $16.99.) A $2 million trust fund is set aside for the Plumb siblings, who are each counting on their share to rescue them from financial straits. But months before they are set to receive the money, Leo, the eldest, squanders a majority of the sum after a car accident; the ensuing family drama of \u201cfirst-world problems proves to be an enjoyable comedy of manners as Sweeney artfully skewers family dynamics,\u201d our reviewer, Patricia Park, wrote. LAROSE, by Louise Erdrich. (Harper Perennial, $15.99.) While hunting buck, Landreaux does the worst thing imaginable: He accidentally kills his best friend\u2019s child. As penance, he offers his own son, LaRose, to the grieving parents, setting in motion a powerful story of ancestry, justice and forgiveness. JOE GOULD\u2019S TEETH, by Jill Lepore. (Vintage, $16.) Gould \u2014 a New York eccentric friendly with many of the early 20th century\u2019s best-known artists \u2014 decided to record everything anyone said to him, aiming to \u201cwiden the sphere of history as Walt Whitman did that of poetry.\u201d The project, known as \u201cThe Oral History of Our Time,\u201d acquired a near-mythic status \u2014 and then some wondered if it ever existed at all. Lepore, a New Yorker staff writer and Harvard historian, sets out to discover the manuscript\u2019s fate.", "item_type": "Article", "abstract": "Six new paperbacks to check out this week.", "created_date": "2017-04-20T15:00:14-04:00", "title": "Paperback Row", "material_type_facet": "List", "published_date": "2017-04-19T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/books/review/paperback-row.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T15:00:14-04:00"}
