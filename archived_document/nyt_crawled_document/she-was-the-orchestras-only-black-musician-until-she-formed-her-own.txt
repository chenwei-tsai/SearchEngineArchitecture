Though Ms. Nwanoku had quickly formed a board of directors and had already selected most of her players \u2014 62 musicians representing 31 different nationalities \u2014 she was constantly reminded that it would be hard to promote their first concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall at the Southbank Center here in September 2015 or to even set up a website without a name. She knew she did not want it to be the Such-and-Such Philharmonic or the Something Symphony, and the recent trend for orchestras to take Latin or Greek names also did not inspire her. But the night before one of her board meetings, the name came to Ms. Nwanoku, a double bass player who grew up in Britain, where she was classically trained. \u201cI literally sat bolt upright in my bed at 4 a.m. and I just shouted \u2018Chineke!\u2019 \u201d she said, referring to a word from the Nigerian Igbo tribe, which was her father\u2019s clan. \u201cIn Chinua Achebe\u2019s book \u2018Things Fall Apart,\u2019 you see the word \u2018Chineke\u2019 every now and then, with people exclaiming it when something amazing happens. It means \u2018wonderful\u2019 or \u2018wow.\u2019 \u201d The next day, when the board members asked her the inevitable question about a name, Ms. Nwanoku told them and explained the meaning behind it. The board loved the idea. \u201cMy dad would be smiling that this Igbo word is being said by everybody,\u201d said Ms. Nwanoku, who has Irish ancestry on her maternal side. \u201cAnd it means something so positive.\u201d Since that first concert, the Chineke! Foundation \u2014 which includes both Europe\u2019s first professional orchestra made up entirely of minority musicians from across Britain and Europe, and also a junior orchestra \u2014 has had a strong impact not only on the musicians involved, but also on the audiences. The first concert in 2015 during the Africa Utopia festival sold out, and fans lined up outside the concert hall hoping to get in. The performance last year, held at the Southbank\u2019s larger Royal Festival Hall, which seats over 2,000, was also hugely popular. This year the orchestra has a number of performances, including a concert this past Sunday, St. George\u2019s Day, at St. George\u2019s Bristol, a former church turned concert space. In May, some members who have performed with the Sphinx Organization, a nonprofit based in Detroit that is dedicated to the development of black and Latino classical musicians, will appear in a musical showcase in the Netherlands. \u201cChi-chi is a force of nature, and what she has been able to do in a short period of time, it has been fantastic,\u201d said Afa S. Dworkin, the president and artistic director of Sphinx. \u201cThe response has been undeniably positive throughout the musical community.\u201d Ms. Nwanoku came up with the idea after attending a showcase of the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s Kinshasa Symphony at Africa Utopia in 2014. It reminded her of a conversation she had had with Ed Vaizey, then Britain\u2019s culture minister, who said that whenever he attended a symphony or ensemble where Ms. Nwanoku was performing, she often was the only member of a minority on stage. Ms. Nwanoku has played with some of Europe\u2019s leading chamber orchestras and was a founding member of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in London. \u201cAll of the orchestras I have played in, I have always been the only person of color for 35 years,\u201d she said, adding that many British orchestras go into minority and ethnic communities to perform and educate on classical music. After the conversation with Mr. Vaizey, and noticing that the audience for the Kinshasa Symphony performance was almost entirely white, she decided to do something. She soon began recruiting professional musicians from across Britain and Europe, including those with Indian, Bangladeshi, Caribbean, African, Sri Lankan, Pakistani and Iranian backgrounds. Within months, Chineke\u2019s professional orchestra was booked to perform at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. \u201cChi-chi managed to get things organized very fast, but you know she was a sprinter,\u201d said Simon Rattle, the artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic and a longtime friend, referring to the fact that Ms. Nwanoku was a competitive runner until age 18, when she was injured. \u201cWe want to spread the word that classical music is for absolutely everybody,\u201d Mr. Rattle said. \u201cAnd of course, we need orchestras to slowly and surely start looking like the communities in which they play.\u201d Five days before Chineke\u2019s debut, the musicians practiced together for the first time, and though they were a bit unsteady at first, they quickly found their feet. \u201cIt was the first time that many of us felt that no one was the odd man out,\u201d Ms. Nwanoku said. \u201cAt the end of the day, everyone was embracing.\u201d Desmond Neysmith, a British cellist who is a Sphinx alumnus, said performing for the first time with Chineke was a highlight of his career. \u201cI have done thousands of concerts, and very few stick out and stay in one\u2019s memory forever,\u201d he said, \u201cand that inaugural concert would be in that category, and it was one of those projects when you get paid at the end, you see it as an extra bonus.\u201d While Mr. Neysmith and other orchestra members say it has been great to perform with one another, Chineke\u2019s true purpose is to inspire young minorities to pick up instruments. \u201cThere is definitely a part of doing this for the younger generation,\u201d said Lena Fankhauser, a Juilliard-trained violist based in Vienna. \u201cFor them to have somebody to look up to, that is one of the main motivations for all of us and why we do what we do.\u201d Sheku Kanneh-Mason, an 18-year-old cellist who is a member of both of Chineke\u2019s orchestras, comes from a family of classical musicians, including an older sister and brother who are both studying at London\u2019s Royal Academy of Music. Mr. Kanneh-Mason, who last year was the first black person to win the BBC\u2019s Young Musician of the Year award, said that when he attended concerts while he was growing up, there were very few black or minority musicians on stage. \u201cIt has been inspiring to see lots of other young musicians like me,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan to be involved in Chineke until Chineke becomes unnecessary because eventually the aim will be for diversity to be the norm in classical music.\u201d", "abstract": "When Chi-chi Nwanoku founded Chineke, an orchestra made up of minority musicians, \u201cIt was the first time that many of us felt that no one was the odd man out.\u201d"}
