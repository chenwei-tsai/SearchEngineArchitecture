The Miami Heat are not hurrying toward any of them. In a change from the team\u2019s normal end-of-season schedule, the organization told players \u2014 whether they were about to become free agents or not \u2014 that they were welcome to stick around and keep working during the coming weeks. So while Monday was the start of the traditional exit meetings with Coach Erik Spoelstra and team officials, it was not a true parting of ways for the off-season. \u201cIt\u2019s cleanup day, not clean-out day,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cLockers are still going to be there. We want our guys to still feel at home here. Free agency is going to happen. A lot of our players are going to have free-agent possibilities or opportunities in July. But that\u2019s July.\u201d So the nameplates will remain on the lockers, the practice gear will not be packed up for the summer, and the sneakers will not be shipped to the players\u2019 off-season homes just yet. While a few players were out of town as they firmed up their off-season plans \u2014 point guard Goran Dragic was returning to his native Slovenia to play for his national team this summer \u2014 some were already thinking about getting back to work. \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s Miami,\u201d shooting guard Dion Waiters said. \u201cWhat other place is better than this in the summertime? I think it\u2019s great that guys should stick around and take advantage of it while you\u2019re here.\u201d Waiters took a $2.9 million deal for this season, saying it was a bet on himself \u2014 and it is likely to pay off, after Miami, which finished 41-41 over all, went 27-19 with him in the lineup. James Johnson, who can become a free agent, is also likely to receive a huge raise after the best season of his career by far. Luke Babbitt can become a free agent, too, and Wayne Ellington has a team option. Some changes are certainly coming, although if this core of Heat players has its way, the team will not look much different in the fall. Miami went 30-11 in the second half of the season, missing a playoff berth only because the Chicago Bulls owned the tiebreaker, and Dragic said that the Heat, if healthy, could make a run next season. \u201cThey know we want them back,\u201d Dragic said of the potential free agents. \u201cThey are a big part of this team. Everybody\u2019s so close, it\u2019s going to be hard for them to choose some other team, too. Hopefully, they stay.\u201d Not making the playoffs was painful, but some Heat players said things had begun returning to normal. Hassan Whiteside, who led the N.B.A. in rebounds per game this season, went to Tyler Johnson\u2019s house for a visit; players and coaches donned bunny ears at an end-of-season team party over the Easter weekend; and a few watched playoff games. There was not a lot of looking ahead, at least for now. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way until this summer,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to still reflect and embrace how unique this season was. I think, so often, all of us fall prey to \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019 and \u2018What is the future?\u2019 \u2014 and you\u2019re not able to enjoy and be present. You miss a lot of great things.\u201d Ellington said he thought he would be back with the Heat, and Waiters, while cautioning that he could not predict the future, indicated that he was thinking about staying with Miami. \u201cIt was a blessing, man \u2014 truly a blessing,\u201d Waiters said. \u201cBut we\u2019re just getting started. It\u2019s only the beginning. It\u2019s only the beginning.\u201d If so, most of those lockers will not need to be cleaned out for quite some time.", "abstract": "In a change from its routine, Miami invited players, including impending free agents, to stick around in the coming weeks, and hopes are already high for next season.", "section": "Sports", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/sports/basketball/miami-heat-offseason.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Heat\u2019s Season Is Over, but They\u2019re Not Ready to Stop Working", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T19:19:54-04:00"}
