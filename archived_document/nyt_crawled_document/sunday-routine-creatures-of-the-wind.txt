{"text": "Although they met in Chicago a decade ago, Shane Gabier, 43, and Christopher Peters, 33, the designers of the clothing line Creatures of the Wind, are a New York couple these days, living in Lower Manhattan in a prewar building that was, appropriately enough, originally built to provide housing for garment industry workers. \u201cSundays are our only day when we are physically forced not to work, because our office building is closed on that day,\u201d Mr. Peters said. \u201cSo even if we wanted to come in, you\u2019re not allowed to. We commit Sundays to actually living our lives.\u201d HEALTHY HIPPIE FOOD Shane Gabier: We wake up between 9:30 and 10 a.m. and eat breakfast at home. We eat pretty much the same thing every day; we have a very well-worn path. It\u2019s some form of peanut butter and bananas on toast, or chia pudding. Christopher Peters: It\u2019s some sort of healthy hippie food, basically, grains and fruits and nuts and stuff like that. COFFEE AND CHITCHAT SG: We go to Caf\u00e9 Grumpy for coffee every morning. We\u2019re definitely there by around 11. We really can\u2019t wait too long or we\u2019ll get a coffee headache. That place is kind of like \u201cCheers.\u201d We will always see at least two or three people we know, hang out for a few minutes and chat. PRIORITY WORKOUTS SG: Then we walk through Chinatown, through the park between Chrystie and Forsyth, to go to the gym. CP: There are all the elderly Chinese people playing card games, mah-jongg, and every other game you can possibly think of. It\u2019s supercool; there are just people getting really rowdy and playing games. SG: We go to Equinox. The SoHo one is our Sunday one, always. I run; I try and do five to six miles. CG: I\u2019ve started to get into lifting. Wherever we\u2019re at, we\u2019re at an Equinox at some point during the day. It\u2019s good to be able to do that for yourself. SUSTENANCE SG: After that, we go for brunch. CP: A lot of times we go to Lovely Day, and I always get the same thing. I like a glass of wine after the gym, because it really carries you. SG: Chris gets the salmon and I get the strawberry pancakes, sometimes with wine, sometimes without. If we don\u2019t go to Lovely Day, then we\u2019ll go to Dimes. Dimes is kind of like our go-to place every day. We go to Dimes grocery almost seven days a week for whatever. CP: Food is superimportant. I probably like food about as much as I like clothes. SG: And food is something that we have never skimped on. Whatever happens, we are always eating well, just for general morale. CULTURE VULTURES SG: By around 3, if we\u2019re not at home spacing out on the sofa, we go to a museum. MoMA is my favorite: I love the architecture; I love the courtyard; I love being up a couple levels and looking over that central space on the second floor. Then we high-tail it back down to our neighborhood, on the F train.  DINNER WITH FRIENDS SG: On Sunday nights, we\u2019ve been, for the last little while, having friends over at our place. CP: For dinner parties, which is great. We\u2019ve been living here for four years, but we finally feel that we have the right matrix of friends where we can have interesting parties of different people. SG: It took us a while in New York City to find those people that also connected with each other, but now we have that group of people, which is really nice. CP: A lot of our friends are people who also work in fashion and travel a lot, so it\u2019s exciting when people come back into town because you get to catch up quite a bit. RETRO RECIPES CP: We buy a lot of vintage cookbooks on eBay. We\u2019ll be like: We\u2019ll just try all these recipes, and just wing it. SG: The cookbook that we use the most is called the \u201cJapanese Country Cookbook.\u201d CP: A lot of times, you\u2019ll look at the recipe and be like, how hard could this be? Ten lines down they\u2019re like, you\u2019re supposed to have vinegared the potatoes the night before. And you\u2019re like: O.K., wait \u2014 what? This is crazy! PARTY DOWN CP: We\u2019ll have maybe six people over, and you\u2019ll lose a couple people at 9:30. You\u2019ll lose a couple more at maybe 10:30, and then the last group, when you\u2019re having a lot of fun, leaves at midnight or 1. We end up drinking a lot of wine, hanging out and talking about things.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/sunday-routine-creatures-of-the-wind.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T09:00:29-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T09:00:29-04:00", "abstract": "Shane Gabier and Christopher Peters spend time working out, eating well and entertaining friends at home.", "title": "How the Creatures of the Wind Designers Spend Their Sundays"}
