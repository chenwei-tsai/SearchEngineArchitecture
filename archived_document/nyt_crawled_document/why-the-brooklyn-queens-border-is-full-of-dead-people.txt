{"text": "Q. Why are there so many cemeteries near the border of Brooklyn and Queens? And what happens when they\u2019re all filled up? A. There are more than a dozen cemeteries near the line separating the two boroughs, in an area sometimes called the Cemetery Belt. More than five million people are buried in Queens alone, outnumbering those living there by more than two to one. The reason for the concentration is simple: As the population of New York \u2014 then just the island of Manhattan \u2014 soared in the early 19th century, the city had trouble finding space for its dead. Churchyards and backyard family plots, long the burial locations of choice, were hemmed in by buildings and could not expand; instead, bodies were sometimes piled into shallow mass graves. As a result, by 1822, unbearable odors were emanating from some cemeteries. To try to speed decomposition, one official had the yard at Trinity Church slaked with lime; he later wrote to a colleague, \u201cThe stench was so offensive as to cause several of my laborers to cascade freely.\u201d (Yes, \u201ccascade\u201d means exactly what you think it does.) Burials were banned south of Canal Street the next year. The state government addressed the issue in 1847, when it passed the Rural Cemetery Act. Inspired by the example of cemeteries like P\u00e8re Lachaise in Paris, Mount Auburn in Boston and Green-Wood in Brooklyn, the law allowed religious institutions and other entities to buy tax-exempt property for grave sites in undeveloped areas. In stark contrast to the slums of Lower Manhattan, which were crowded with tenements, the area around the border between Kings and Queens Counties was barren and, thus, an ideal location for numerous human remains. \u201cIt\u2019s land that is bumpy and rocky and difficult to farm on,\u201d said Jack Eichenbaum, the Queens borough historian. \u201cThe cemeteries developed a part of Queens that was not developable for anything else.\u201d A land rush followed the act\u2019s passage, as religious institutions and other organizations, not to mention enterprising speculators, raced to buy pastoral property. \u201cThe ideal location had rolling topography, views of the harbor and very short vistas,\u201d said Jeff Richman, the historian of Green-Wood Cemetery. \u201cThis was land that was not really good for farming or for constructing a pond but perfect for a picturesque cemetery.\u201d Attention to aesthetics was not for the dead alone. In an era that predated manicured green spaces like Central Park, cemeteries were popular leisure destinations; during the 1860s, Green-Wood rivaled Niagara Falls as the nation\u2019s top tourist site. The city\u2019s Common Council banned burials south of 86th Street in 1852, citing the supposed role of human corpses in spreading outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever. Over the next few decades, rising property values led most of Manhattan\u2019s graveyards to evict their residents. Hundreds of thousands of bodies were exhumed and taken by cart and boat to their new final resting places, sometimes in the dead of night, to limit the number of onlookers. Because of mass burials and disintegrated coffins, many of the remains had scattered. Today, even the other boroughs are running out of burial spots. Calvary Cemetery in Queens, where three million Catholics are buried, and Washington Cemetery, the Jewish graveyard in Brooklyn, are among sites that have been completely developed. Both have taken pains in recent years to find additional space for ground burials. There are no current plans for the establishment of new cemeteries in New York City, according to the New York State Department of State. Any new cemeteries would require the City Council\u2019s approval.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/why-the-brooklyn-queens-border-is-full-of-dead-people.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T09:00:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T09:00:05-04:00", "abstract": "Early on, that area was seen as an ideal spot for (theoretically) final resting places.", "title": "Why the Brooklyn-Queens Border Is Full of Dead People"}
