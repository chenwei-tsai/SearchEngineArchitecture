{"section": "World", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s Supreme Court on Thursday declared Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, a Christian denomination that rejects violence, an extremist organization, banning the group from operating on Russian territory and putting its more than 170,000 Russian worshipers in the same category as Islamic State militants. The ruling, which confirmed an order last month by the Justice Ministry that the denomination be \u201cliquidated\u201d \u2014 essentially eliminated or disbanded, had been widely expected. Russian courts rarely challenge government decisions no matter what the evidence. Viktor Zhenkov, a lawyer for the Christian group, said Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses will appeal the ruling, which he said had focused on the activities of the organization\u2019s so-called administrative center, a complex of offices outside St. Petersburg, but also branded all of its nearly 400 regional branches as extremist. \u201cWe consider this decision an act of political repression that is impermissible in contemporary Russia,\u201d Mr. Zhenkov said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe will, of course, appeal.\u201d An initial appeal will be made to the Supreme Court\u2019s appellate division, said Mr. Zhenkov, and if that fails, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses will take its case to the European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, France. Hard-line followers of Russia\u2019s dominant faith, the Orthodox Church, have lobbied for years to have Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses outlawed or at least curbed as a heretical sect, but the main impetus for the current campaign to crush a Christian group active in Russia for more than a century seems to have come from the country\u2019s increasingly assertive security apparatus. Founded in the United States in the 19th century, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses has its worldwide headquarters in the United States and, along with all foreign-led groups outside the control of the state, it is viewed with deep suspicion by Russia\u2019s post-Soviet version of the KGB, the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B. Summing up the Justice Ministry\u2019s case against the denomination, the ministry\u2019s representative, Svetlana Borisova, told the Supreme Court on Thursday that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had shown \u201csigns of extremist activity that represent a threat to the rights of citizens, social order and the security of society.\u201d During six days of hearings over two weeks, lawyers and witnesses for the religious group repeatedly dismissed the extremist allegation as absurd, arguing that reading the Bible and promoting its nonviolent message could in no way be construed as extremist. Human Rights Watch, in a statement issued in Moscow, condemned the court ruling as \u201ca serious breach of Russia\u2019s obligations to respect and protect religious freedom.\u201d Rachel Denber, the human rights group\u2019s deputy director for Europe and Central Asia, said the decision delivered \u201ca terrible blow to freedom of religion and association in Russia.\u201d Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses shuns political activity and has no record of even peaceful \u2014 never mind violent \u2014 hostility to the Russian authorities. But it has faced growing hostility from the state since President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia began his third term in 2012 and put the Orthodox Church at the center of his push to assert Russia as a great military and moral power. The denomination suffered relentless persecution by the KGB during the Soviet era and, after more than a decade of relative peace following the collapse of Communism in 1991, it again became a target for official harassment under a 2002 anti-extremism law that makes it illegal for any group, other than the Orthodox Church and other traditional religious institutions, to proclaim itself as offering a true path to religious or political salvation.", "item_type": "Article", "abstract": "The pacifist denomination said it would appeal the ruling, which puts it on the same footing as Islamic State militants.", "created_date": "2017-04-20T14:50:01-04:00", "title": "Russia Bans Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Calling It an Extremist Group", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-19T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/world/europe/russia-bans-jehovahs-witnesses.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T15:12:30-04:00"}
