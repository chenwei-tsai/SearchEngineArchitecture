{"text": "VARNER, Ark. \u2014 The State of Arkansas, which had rebuffed fears about its use of a controversial lethal injection drug, faced scrutiny early Friday about how well the drug had worked during the state\u2019s fourth execution in seven days. Kenneth D. Williams, a convicted murderer, died at 11:05 p.m. on Thursday at the Cummins Unit, a state prison in southeast Arkansas. A news media witness reported that Mr. Williams briefly experienced \u201ccoughing, convulsing, lurching, jerking\u201d after the state began to administer midazolam, the first of its three lethal injection drugs. \u201cThis is my 10th execution,\u201d said the witness, Kelly P. Kissel of The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen that.\u201d Mr. Kissel said Mr. Williams lurched forward 20 times \u2014 15 of them in rapid succession \u2014 and emitted sounds that could be heard in an adjacent room. By then, a microphone in the execution chamber had been switched off. The execution was not unusually long. Although Mr. Kissel and other witnesses depicted Mr. Williams\u2019s last moments as unsettling, state officials appeared unbothered. A spokesman for Gov. Asa Hutchinson, J. R. Davis, said the authorities believed Mr. Williams\u2019s movements amounted to \u201cinvoluntary muscular reaction.\u201d Mr. Davis, who did not witness the execution, added, \u201cThere was no testimony that he was in pain.\u201d The competing, immediate narratives about Thursday\u2019s execution were certain to fuel debate about midazolam\u2019s role as an execution drug in the United States. The medicine, a sedative, is intended to render prisoners unconscious before injections of other, more painful drugs that stop a person\u2019s breathing and heart. The United States Supreme Court has upheld its use in executions, despite arguments that the drug is not powerful enough to mask the pain of some lethal injections. In a statement early Friday, a lawyer for Mr. Williams, Shawn Nolan, requested a formal inquiry that Mr. Davis had already signaled was unlikely to be forthcoming. \u201cWhat\u2019s important right now is that all the information about tonight\u2019s execution must be meticulously documented and preserved so that we can discover exactly what happened in that execution chamber,\u201d Mr. Nolan said. Mr. Williams, 38, was expected to be the last Arkansas prisoner put to death for some time, chiefly because the state\u2019s midazolam supply will expire within days. Jodie Efird, a daughter of one of Mr. Williams\u2019s victims, said she believed the state had \u201cflawlessly\u201d carried out the execution. \u201cAny kind of movement he had was far less than his victims,\u201d she said after Mr. Williams was pronounced dead.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/arkansas-execution-midazolam-lethal-injection.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T03:17:55-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T03:15:17-04:00", "abstract": "A condemned man experienced \u201ccoughing, convulsing, lurching, jerking\u201d after the state administered midazolam, the first of three lethal injection drugs.", "title": "After Arkansas Execution, Questions Are Raised About Drug\u2019s Effectiveness"}
