{"text": "When the star soprano Diana Damrau joined the Virgin Classics label in 2006, she met its president, Alain Lanceron, after a performance. He asked what she\u2019d like to record. A Mozart and Salieri collection, she answered \u2014 and an album of the once-celebrated, now-neglected 19th-century German opera composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. More than a decade later, \u201cGrand Opera,\u201d whose title pays tribute to the genre of which Meyerbeer was the master, will be released on Friday, May 5. It\u2019s a departure for Ms. Damrau, a singer who mostly hews to the standards. But in a tough environment for selling records, esoteric is in. \u201cThese days you have to find new ideas for recordings,\u201d Mr. Lanceron said by phone recently. \u201cNot just the same old arias.\u201d Few things could be further from the same old arias than Meyerbeer (1791-1864). Hardly a corner of the repertory has grown mustier, a puzzling development given the composer\u2019s prominence during his lifetime. In his heyday, Meyerbeer was a uniquely powerful hitmaker, as well as an innovator who brought opera to new levels of orchestral color, dramatic scale, choral mass, historical richness and theatrical dazzle. In a series of works for the Paris Opera, beginning with \u201cRobert le Diable\u201d (1831), Meyerbeer systematically deepened the art form and how it was created. Writing a libretto, formerly a text dashed off in a few weeks, became a full collaboration between a composer and a librettist that could take years. Dramaturges and stage directors had roles of new significance. Meyerbeer helped invent the idea of tailoring dramatic and musical structures to each work, giving a courtly French tinge to \u201cLes Huguenots\u201d (1836); rougher, darker Teutonic tones to \u201cLe Proph\u00e8te\u201d (1849); and perfumed lyricism to evoke the Portuguese and Indian settings of \u201cL\u2019Africaine\u201d (1865). \u201cWithout him, Wagner is unthinkable, and much of Verdi,\u201d Leon Botstein, who conducted a revival of \u201cLes Huguenots\u201d at Bard College in 2009, said in an interview. \u201cHe and Rossini invent 19th-century opera.\u201d But in the decades after his death, Meyerbeer began to disappear from opera houses, one of the most important and influential composers ever to be so completely marginalized. He became better known as the object of Wagner\u2019s vicious, anti-Semitic disdain than for his music. With their seemingly old-fashioned artificiality, his works grew dogged by a reputation for unbearable length and vacuous spectacle. By the turn of the 20th century, George Bernard Shaw could write: \u201cNowadays young people cannot understand how anyone could have taken Meyerbeer\u2019s influence seriously.\u201d The Metropolitan Opera last performed a Meyerbeer opera in 1979: \u201cLe Proph\u00e8te,\u201d mounted for Marilyn Horne. \u201cL\u2019Africaine\u201d? Not since 1934. \u201cLes Huguenots\u201d was possibly the most successful opera of the 19th century, the first to reach 1,000 performances at the Paris Opera. But performances trailed off over the past century. The Met last put it on in 1915. \u201cWhy the Met doesn\u2019t do it is astonishing,\u201d Mr. Botstein said of \u201cLes Huguenots.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s completely relevant because it\u2019s about religious fanaticism. This is about people killing each other over religious belief.\u201d But while the Met has not yet shown signs of budging, a critical re-evaluation has been accompanied by recent glimmers of a renaissance. The Deutsche Oper in Berlin is in the midst of a cycle of Meyerbeer classics, with \u201cLe Proph\u00e8te\u201d to come in November; when the company did \u201cLes Huguenots\u201d in the fall, Opera News observed that the staging was one of three productions of the piece in Germany this season. Laurent Pelly\u2019s 2012 staging of \u201cRobert le Diable\u201d returned that work to the Royal Opera House in London for the first time since 1890. A 1988 San Francisco production of \u201cL\u2019Africaine\u201d with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo has just been rereleased on DVD. Ms. Damrau\u2019s invaluable \u201cGrand Opera,\u201d with Emmanuel Villaume conducting the orchestra and chorus of the Lyon Opera, doesn\u2019t just include arias and scenes from the better-known (that is to say, known-at-all) pieces. The disc also exposes true rarities like \u201cAlimelek\u201d and \u201cEmma di Resburgo,\u201d products of Meyerbeer\u2019s early forays into Italy and Germany, before his triumphant maturity in France. And this won\u2019t be the extent of Ms. Damrau\u2019s commitment to the composer: She is scheduled to star a few years from now in what will be a hotly anticipated new production of \u201cLes Huguenots\u201d at the Paris Opera with the tenor Bryan Hymel, who sang the title role in that recent London \u201cRobert le Diable\u201d and in 2015 released \u201cH\u00e9ro\u00efque,\u201d a French grand opera album. Born Jacob Liebmann Beer, Meyerbeer \u2014 as a young man he combined his maternal and paternal family names \u2014 was a child of the Prussian Jewish elite; both his parents were influential at the royal court. He was a virtuoso pianist before he found fame as a composer, fully embracing opera during a long early stretch in Italy. (It was a homage to his successes there that he began to go by Giacomo instead of Jacob.) With \u201cIl Crociato in Egitto\u201d (1824), he grew so celebrated that, when discussing the possibilities of creating an opera out of \u201cFaust,\u201d Goethe said that he wanted someone \u201clike Meyerbeer\u201d to compose it. But it was only once he began writing for the Paris Opera, which had the world\u2019s most impressive resources, that he made his full impact. With \u201cLes Huguenots,\u201d about the battle between Protestants and Catholics in 16th-century France, Meyerbeer began to see opera not as the play of individuals, but as a grander, more impersonal spectacle. \u201cHis historical operas are not simply based on historical subjects,\u201d the scholar Matthias Brzoska has written, \u201cbut take the historical process itself as their subject.\u201d The activity of large, anonymous crowds became his focal point, obliging an entirely new approach to the chorus and giving rise to the thrilling antiphonal explosions of the third-act finale of \u201cLes Huguenots\u201d and the organ-spiked coronation scene in \u201cLe Proph\u00e8te.\u201d To match this musical majesty, Meyerbeer demanded revolutionary advances in stage technology. One of the first onstage uses of an electric spotlight brought to life a sunrise in \u201cLe Proph\u00e8te\u201d; for its scandalous ballet for the sex-crazed ghosts of nuns, \u201cRobert le Diable\u201d featured perhaps the first realistically moonlit \u2014 that is, lit from above \u2014 night. The scenery for \u201cLes Huguenots\u201d cost 66,000 francs, more than double the price of Rossini\u2019s sweeping \u201cGuillaume Tell\u201d just seven years earlier. The premiere production of \u201cL\u2019Africaine,\u201d after Meyerbeer\u2019s death, featured the first completely revolving stage set and a fantastically realistic shipwreck. Recordings obviously can\u2019t do justice to this aspect of his operas, but Ms. Damrau\u2019s new album, nearly an hour and a half of music, has its own lavish exuberance. Coloratura showpieces, like \u201cOmbre l\u00e9g\u00e8re\u201d from \u201cLe Pardon de Plo\u00ebrmel,\u201d share the disc with extended scenes from \u201cLes Huguenots\u201d and \u201cL\u2019Africaine\u201d and, in what may be its first recording, the meaty \u201cLebe wohl, geliebte Schwester\u201d from \u201cEin Feldlager in Schlesien.\u201d It\u2019s fascinating work \u2014 so why Meyerbeer\u2019s slow fade? Wagner, and what he came to represent, is key. Meyerbeer was generous toward the younger, characteristically obsequious composer when Wagner was starting out. But some combination of factors \u2014 Meyerbeer\u2019s religion, the privations of Wagner\u2019s exile from Germany after a leftist uprising, Wagner\u2019s need to reject an artistic father figure \u2014 turned the younger man. In his grotesque 1850 pamphlet \u201cJewishness in Music,\u201d he condemned Meyerbeer without naming him: \u201cThe uninspiring, the truly laughable, is the characteristic mark whereby this famed composer shows his Jewishness in his music.\u201d A year later, in \u201cOpera and Drama,\u201d he sneered at Meyerbeer\u2019s \u201ceffects without causes.\u201d Used to having enemies, Meyerbeer bore the attacks with equanimity, continuing to speak well of Wagner and his work. But with Wagner ascendant, it was perhaps inevitable that Meyerbeer would decline. And his withering from the repertory wasn\u2019t simply because of injustice. The demands he placed on singers made his works daunting to cast. His plots can be thin, though it has been argued that this was more or less intentional, a way of highlighting social and historical processes rather than individual interactions. Processes aren\u2019t the path to modern popularity. Rossini, even serious, is more ingratiatingly personal. Henry Blaze de Bury, a Meyerbeer advocate, wrote that \u201che uplifts, he stirs, but hardly has what we commonly call the gift of tears\u201d \u2014 the gift, in other words, of what many want from opera. But Meyerbeer may be just the composer for our moment, not just in his subject matter but also in his almost proto-postmodern resistance to the fully immersive naturalism that would become the operatic norm after Wagner. Our taste for movies in which the protagonist, say, addresses the viewer (think Ferris Bueller) and novels that draw attention to novelistic conventions has much to do with his style. Meyerbeer was the master of a kind of detachment that paradoxically heightened his theatrical power. \u201cHe keeps the audience on the edge of their seats by not releasing them from the fact that they\u2019re half on the stage and half in their seats,\u201d Mr. Botstein said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe this is a kind of narcotic escape.\u201d He continues to inspire passionate partisans. The final pages of \u201cL\u2019Africaine,\u201d Robert Ignatius Letellier wrote in his introduction to Meyerbeer\u2019s diaries, \u201cbreak through the bounds of time, space and history to perceive a spiritual sphere, a pure realm of love where all are equal.\u201d Hyperbole? Modern audiences should get the chance to decide for themselves.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/music/heard-of-giacomo-meyerbeer-hes-on-the-cusp-of-a-musical-renaissance.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T15:38:39-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T15:38:39-04:00", "abstract": "A new album is one of the signs of renewed interest in the once-popular works of this 19th-century opera composer.", "title": "Heard of Giacomo Meyerbeer?
