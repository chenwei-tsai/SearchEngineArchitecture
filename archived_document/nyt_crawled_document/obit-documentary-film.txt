{"text": "A few years ago, the New York Public Library played host to a panel discussion called \u201cDead From the NYPL: The Perverse Pleasures of Obituaries.\u201d It drew an overflow, enthralled crowd, of which I was a member. As the evening wore on, it occurred to me for the first time that the writing of obituaries \u2014 my job at The Times since 2008 \u2014 might be a glamorous occupation with an enthusiastic fan base. The feeling returned not long after Vanessa Gould, a documentary producer, showed up at our Midtown Manhattan offices in 2012 to make a film about the newspaper\u2019s obituary department. Titled \u201cObit,\u201d it is now open in limited release. Movie cameras are not unprecedented at The Times. In 2011, the paper was the subject of \u201cPage One: Inside The New York Times,\u201d a fly-on-the-wall documentary that focused on the media desk and, powerless to resist, allowed the columnist David Carr to steal the picture. But that was media. Media is a sizzling subject, pulsating with the here and now. Obituaries, by definition, stare fixedly in the rearview mirror. Worse, they begin, as they must, with the bleakest of all possible announcements: Someone has died. Not a juicy premise for a film, one would suppose. Add to that the nature of the enterprise: gathering facts, arranging them, pressing the keyboard with one\u2019s fingertips, cutting a few words and adding a few others. Except for the phone calls, it\u2019s an inward-looking process, at least for the reporters. How do you make drama out of that? Ms. Gould had a few ideas up her sleeve. For one thing, she made the brilliant decision to film Jeff Roth\u2019s post-structuralist explanation of the morgue, as the newspaper\u2019s library of clippings is known \u2014 a shaggy-dog narrative meted out over the course of the film. She also took the time to follow a few obituaries through as they were being written, zooming in on furrowed brows as deadlines neared and, a touch sadistically, recording the moans and groans of reporters wrestling with leads. Ms. Gould turned up at my home early in the project, had her crew set up lights in my kitchen (you can see a few dirty dishes stacked on a microwave behind me) and for the next two and a half hours grilled me not only on the details of the job but also on the cosmic issues. Does dealing with death every day change you? Does it make you re-examine your own life? And on and on. The small-gauge questions were easy to deal with. It was fun to walk down memory lane, recalling fallen heroes like Lash LaRue, Hollywood\u2019s master of the bullwhip, or Roman Opalka, the Polish conceptual artist who painted millions of numbers in his (sadly interrupted) march toward infinity. I did not mind recalling a few bruising conversations with dissatisfied relatives, like the son who recommended that I make a fist and knock my own teeth out. (He had wanted a much darker portrait of his father, whom he despised, and I failed to deliver.) The big questions made me sweat. Although surrounded by the dead \u2014 my subjects, not my colleagues \u2014 I rarely think morbid thoughts. With some obvious exceptions, obits are unexpectedly happy occasions, more like the memorial service than the funeral. They recall days of glory and great accomplishments \u2014 like the naming of the Slinky. And yet. If you write about the dead, day in and day out, the shadows gather. The beat does make you think, measuring your own life and paltry achievements against those who, posthumously, land on Page B16 or A23 or \u2014 I think, randomly, of my subjects Christopher Hitchens, Harper Lee and Derek Walcott \u2014 on the front page. If a wistful Chekhovian mood creeps into the film from time to time, that\u2019s not by accident. It emanates from us, the sensitive caretakers of the illustrious departed, chaperones of the dead as they make their way to the next world.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/insider/obit-documentary-film.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Times Insider", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T17:08:20-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T17:08:20-04:00", "abstract": "The reporter William Grimes talks about his onscreen appearance in \u201cObits,\u201d a new documentary about a department reveling in newfound glamour.", "title": "Lights, Camera, Obits!"}
