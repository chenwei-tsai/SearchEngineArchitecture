{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "April has been a cruel month for big brands trying to look cool. First, Pepsi released, then pulled back, an awkward ad featuring Kendall Jenner that appropriated imagery from the Black Lives Matter movement. Then, Zara withdrew a denim skirt with patches that bore a striking resemblance to Pepe the Frog, a meme that was designated an alt-right hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League. Now, Nordstrom is drawing jeers on social media for selling a pair of jeans and a denim jacket from the label Prps that are covered in a mudlike material and resemble a used gardening outfit or a Canadian tuxedo that has seen better days. The fact that each item sells for $425 is what set people off. The store\u2019s website copy says the jeans \u201cembody rugged, Americana workwear that\u2019s seen some hard-working action.\u201d The description then falls into a time warp when it claims the stains on the jacket \u201cgive you permission to get down and dirty from rodeo to grungy rock show.\u201d Cue Alice in Chains. Plenty of stores and labels offer distressed jeans, which come with a whiff of bohemian chic. Take, for example, a pair of discolored, paint-splattered, torn pants from Robin\u2019s Jeans that sell for $595 at Neiman Marcus. Or may we interest you in a thoroughly shredded pair from Rag & Bone that was originally priced at $325 on shopbop.com? The Prps denim, with its entry into what might be termed manual-labor chic, seems to have set the internet ablaze with its attempt to take the look of those who work difficult jobs and sell it at a price affordable to those unlikely to earn their keep by the sweat of their plucked brows. On Monday, Mike Rowe, the former host of Discovery Channel\u2019s television show \u201cDirty Jobs,\u201d posted a stinging rebuke of the product to his Facebook page, which has more than 4.7 million followers. \u201cThe Barracuda Straight Leg Jeans aren\u2019t pants,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey\u2019re not even fashion. They\u2019re a costume for wealthy people who see work as ironic \u2014 not iconic.\u201d Mr. Rowe\u2019s post has been shared more than 14,000 times. Twitter users quickly took to their accounts to fire off more taunts. Steve Butts suggested, \u201cFor when you need a pair of jeans as fake as you are.\u201d \u201cIt seems my 5 year old son is a fashion designer. #mudjeans,\u201d Jonny Rothschild said in a post. \u201cNordstrom is selling pre-soiled/mud stained designer jeans + Balenciaga is hawking a $2K IKEA look-alike tote. Contractor chic is IN,\u201d Erica Russell commented, referring to a blue leather bag that the luxury label debuted in its spring 2017 men\u2019s show that looks similar to the furniture retailer\u2019s 99-cent tote. (Ikea recently took advantage of the copycat design with a tongue-in-cheek ad that helps consumers identify an \u201coriginal Ikea Frakta bag.\u201d) Some users saw a chance to cash in. One Twitter post read, \u201cMy grandpa is selling his barracuda straight leg jeans for $400, cheaper than what Nordstrom wants, hmu for details!!!\u201d Others pointed out another unlikely pair of pants that was recently on sale at Topshop and appears to have been pulled from the site. \u201cWeird day in jeans retail: Nordstrom offering fake mud jeans for $425, TopShop selling plastic jeans for $100,\u201d Darren Rovell wrote. The juxtaposition recalled the contentious \u201cclear-knee mom jeans\u201d \u2014 $95 pants with plastic windows at the knee \u2014 from Topshop that Nordstrom was mocked for selling last month. \u201cWe are truly living in the dark time line,\u201d one Twitter user wrote at the time. Nordstrom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For now, the muddied jeans and jacket remain available online.", "title": "Mud-Smeared Jeans?
