In stark contrast to his showy side, he is pathologically secretive about his taxes. Now, by an action that affronts the essence of open government, he declares that the White House visitor logs shall be closed to public scrutiny. By each of his actions to evade public disclosure, the president is advertising exactly where he is hiding secrets that he hopes the public will not discover. DAVID ERDMAN, CHARLOTTE, N.C. To the Editor: The Trump administration claims that it is no longer posting White House visitor logs out of grave national security concerns. This is the same rationale for the public\u2019s demanding access to them.
