Our eyes met, and she gave me a charming smile. \u201cWell,\u201d I said to myself as I returned her smile, \u201cI guess you still have what the ladies like.\u201d At which point she stood up and offered me her seat.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/nyregion/metropolitan-diary-the-smile-didnt-mean-what-he-thought.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Brief", "created_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:06-04:00", "abstract": "Misinterpreting a friendly glance on the subway.", "title": "The Smile Didn\u2019t Mean What He Thought"}
