{"text": "Alexandre Mattiussi, the hirsute designer of the French label AMI, has thick, curly hair, which he sometimes wears in Romanesque waves, and a bushy beard. But his most notable facial hair is the inch of fuzz that connects his eyebrows, making them one. \u201cIt\u2019s my signature,\u201d he said in 2014. \u201cOne of my friends told me you should take it off, and I said, \u2018You won\u2019t recognize me.\u2019 It\u2019s my thing.\u201d The basketball player Anthony Davis, too, is known for his eyebrow \u2014 singular \u2014 something he has no interest in changing. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change who I am,\u201d he told ESPN in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d He added, \u201cI guess it just makes me different.\u201d Levi\u2019s recently posted an image of the model Adrien Sahores to its Instagram account, with a thin but noticeable tuft of hair joining his brows. \u201cHe had a really natural self-confidence that we loved,\u201d said Levi\u2019s global creative director, Chad Hinson. Like Frida Kahlo, Bert of \u201cSesame Street\u201d and George Harrison before them, a new generation is embracing the subversive charm of the unibrow. In our overly plucked and supremely groomed world, there\u2019s a rebelliousness to leaving the brow as nature intended. In some cultures, the unibrow \u2014 sometimes called a monobrow \u2014 is even seen as a sign of good luck, and for men, a signifier of virility and fertility. Abraham Ortuno, a 29-year-old accessory designer who lives in Paris, flaunts his unibrow, sharing it with his Instagram followers. He goes with the term \u201cplatform eyebrows\u201d for the brow as a whole. \u201cI\u2019ve never been embarrassed by them,\u201d Mr. Ortuno said. \u201cThe opposite, actually. I don\u2019t get it when someone has designed eyebrows.\u201d J D Samson, a musician and artist, is another person who refuses to pluck. \u201cI knew one day it would come around,\u201d she said. In high school, she was named \u201cbest eyebrows\u201d by her classmates, which she suspects was a joke. \u201cWhen I got to college, I fully embraced it,\u201d Ms. Samson said. Her acceptance of her look came about partly because of the encouragement of a friend, the artist K8 Hardy. \u201cShe was like: \u2018You should just make it your thing and be proud of it. Wear it with pride.\u2019 I\u2019ll never forget that day.\u201d Jo\u00e3o Moraes, a 29-year-old art director, said he keeps his unibrow because of \u201ca mixture of aesthetics and laziness.\u201d After plucking it during his early teenage years in response to teasing, he eventually found peace with his natural look. \u201cI realized it wasn\u2019t the way my face was supposed to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a process where I was like: \u2018This is what I got. I\u2019ve got to rock it.\u2019\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/fashion/mens-style/embracing-the-unibrow.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T12:19:31-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T12:19:31-04:00", "abstract": "Put down the tweezers.
