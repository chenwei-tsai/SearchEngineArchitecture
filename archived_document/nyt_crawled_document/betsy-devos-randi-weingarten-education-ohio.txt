He was fielding questions from public officials and the national news media, keeping tabs on planned protests and coordinating a meeting with United States Marshals. \u201cNothing like this happens in Van Wert!\u201d said Mr. Amstutz, a small-town school superintendent. Then on Thursday, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Randi Weingarten, her antagonist and president of the American Federation of Teachers, descended on this small, rural school district for a highly anticipated meeting of two polarizing education leaders. In a town that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, and that takes pride in its public school system, educators hoped the two leaders could find common ground. The area remains avowedly Republican but is leery of the budget cuts that Mr. Trump has proposed for federal aid to poor school districts. Parents also have little use for the Trump administration\u2019s push to expand school choice and access to private-school vouchers. They want their neighborhood schools to work, because that is what they have. \u201cWe\u2019ve always voted Republican,\u201d Mr. Amstutz said. \u201cPublic education is one area where Republicans have done nothing for us, really.\u201d Ms. Weingarten and Ms. DeVos made for strange traveling companions. Ms. Weingarten called Ms. DeVos\u2019s confirmation a \u201csad day for children\u201d and has accused the billionaire secretary of undermining public education by bankrolling school choice initiatives in Michigan. Ms. DeVos is a staunch supporter of parochial and charter schools and has challenged teachers\u2019 unions. While she says she supports public schools, she has been sharply critical of their performance and believes in expanding options for parents. The two leaders have also clashed over Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed budget, which would cut the Education Department by $9 billion, targeting programs for poor students, even as it funds a $1.4 billion school choice initiative. Ms. Weingarten challenged Ms. DeVos to visit a public school system, and the result was the visit to Van Wert, a small district with a robust early childhood program, a nationally recognized robotics team and a community school that helps at-risk students graduate. \u201cIt was clear that this community has invested heart and soul into the students here,\u201d Ms. DeVos said, praising the district. Ms. Weingarten said the visit \u201cproves that support for public schools transcends politics.\u201d For teachers and students here, fights over funding and policy are not abstract. Jen Arend, a literacy specialist at Van Wert\u2019s early childhood center, is paid with federal Title I money, which provides additional resources to districts with high concentrations of poverty. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposes increasing Title I funding but using it for school choice initiatives. \u201cI hope she sees we\u2019re more than a line item in the budget,\u201d Ms. Arend said of Ms. DeVos. At Van Wert High School, Spencer Teman, a senior, showcased his robotics team\u2019s 18-by-18-inch robot, Suzanne, which won the state robotics championship this year. \u201cIn our school, opportunities are everywhere, and they should stay here,\u201d said Mr. Teman, 18, who is set to attend Miami University of Ohio next year. Van Wert, which serves 2,000 students two hours northwest of Columbus, is an unlikely place for a national showdown on education policy, which is largely driven by big-city politics. But it illustrates how politics and public education do not always match up. About 80 percent of Van Wert\u2019s 13,584 votes in November went to Mr. Trump, and the town is considered among the most conservative in the state. But \u201ceducation is different,\u201d said Linda Haycock, a newly elected state school board member who represents Van Wert and 22 other small northwestern Ohio counties. \u201cBecause in rural districts, they have the most to lose.\u201d Mr. Amstutz said that in Van Wert\u2019s schools, \u201cwe struggle every day to make ends meet.\u201d The school district is more than 95 percent white, and half of its students qualify for free or reduced-priced meals \u2014 an increase of 10 percentage points from when Mr. Amstutz took over as superintendent 10 years ago. The school system\u2019s $22 million budget supports five schools: an elementary school, a middle school, a high school, an early childhood center and an alternative school. The district receives about $2 million in federal funding. Title I pays for teachers who work with struggling readers in kindergarten through third grade. And Van Wert uses the federal Title II program, which funds professional development and is targeted for elimination, to reduce class sizes. Spending federal money or any other taxpayer funds on vouchers for private school tuition is looked on harshly. Ms. Haycock called it \u201creally theft.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s saying we passed a levy to go to our school district, and it\u2019s really going somewhere else,\u201d she said. Educators hope Ms. DeVos saw during her visit that they make do with what they have. In the elementary school, 60 percent of students are below the poverty line, and the school had to hire many support staff members, including a social worker whose caseload swelled to 40 this year, to help students and families meet basic needs and manage hardships. \u201cOut here in the middle of cow country, we have this amazing opportunity to serve kids who are no different than kids anywhere else,\u201d said Kevin Gehres, the elementary school\u2019s principal. \u201cOur funding is the blood, sweat and tears of our community, and we are held accountable for that.\u201d In the middle school, principals have overhauled scheduling to give teachers control of nearly 300 minutes of a 400-minute day. The district has a 96 percent graduation rate, but Van Wert High School\u2019s principal, Bob Priest, said he knew of 86 unfilled jobs at the local farm and food processing company. Too many students leave school unable to fill the jobs because they cannot pass a drug test and show up to work on time, he said. So the school has an internship program that pairs students with local businesses. Van Wert educators said they believed their biggest threat was school choice. An expanded voucher program would be \u201cpotentially catastrophic\u201d for the district\u2019s finances, said Mike Ruen, the district\u2019s treasurer. About 400 students now take advantage of a state open-enrollment policy, which Ms. DeVos endorsed during her visit. It allows students to attend an out-of-district school and take $6,000 in state per-pupil funding with them. Most of them attend schools in a neighboring suburb. About 20 students are enrolled in an online charter school that has a 39 percent graduation rate. And a local vocational school takes 80 percent of the funding for each student who transfers there. Only one private school competes directly with Van Wert public schools: a small Catholic elementary school in town that the public school system provides special education services to, mostly at no charge. A Catholic high school 15 miles away is less of a draw, but could become one if parents receive vouchers. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are against choice,\u201d Mr. Amstutz said. \u201cBut when you talk about expansion, taking money away from public schools, it gives people heartburn.\u201d Ms. DeVos made no commitments to changing course on the federal budget and policies, but said she needed to digest the visit. Ms. Weingarten, who has been invited to tour a school of choice with Ms. DeVos, said her union would continue to fight vigorously against budget cuts and publicly funded vouchers. \u201cI think today was important, and I hope that she saw things that will make her reflect on the importance of public education to our country,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said of Ms. DeVos. \u201cTime will tell.\u201d", "abstract": "The town of Van Wert, Ohio, became a crossroads of federal policy with a visit by Education Secretary DeVos and Randi Weingarten, a teachers\u2019 union leader.", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T22:09:04-04:00", "title": "Ohio Town\u2019s Schools Hope to Be \u2018More Than a Line Item\u2019 in the Federal Budget", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/us/politics/betsy-devos-randi-weingarten-education-ohio.html"}
