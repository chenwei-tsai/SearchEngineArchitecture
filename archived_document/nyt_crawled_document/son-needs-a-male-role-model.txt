{"text": "My husband and I divorced when our son was a baby. It was messy, and my son has no contact with him \u2014 which is sort of the problem. I am an only child, my father is dead, and my close friends are women. So, my 12-year-old boy is without an adult male role model. I would like him to have one. A close friend has a wonderful son in college who will soon be coming home for the summer. Would it be crazy if I asked my friend (or her son) if he would be willing to hang out with my son? ANN MARIE, NEW YORK Crazy? No. But awkward and unlikely to achieve your goal? Most definitely. Twenty-year-olds and preteenagers are not natural playmates \u2014 unless you are living in the world of early Judd Apatow films. (And you probably don\u2019t want your son hanging out with that version of Seth Rogen.) Even if you shared your motives with your friend, it seems unlikely to me that you will squeeze more than an outing or two from a kindhearted Joe College. So, bring out the Benjamins. Be honest with your friend and her son, and offer to hire him to watch your young man once or twice a week. Depending on their interests (and your budget), they can play tennis in the park or go to dinner and a movie. Meanwhile, you can join a book club or catch up on your me-time. Win-win, right? Now, this advice runs counter to Mike Mills\u2019s terrific film, \u201c20th Century Women,\u201d in which Annette Bening, in a situation like yours, enlists even more women to help her raise a good man. Surrounding your son with good people, regardless of their gender, is your first move. But I get your desire for him to see how stand-up men operate in the world. (Also, check with your son\u2019s teacher for school-sponsored options.) My lovely 27-year-old daughter has intellectual deficits and a seizure disorder. Unfortunately, the seizures cannot be predicted or prevented, and they are disruptive. Even more unfortunately, my brother and sister-in-law used the seizures as their explicit reason for not inviting her to her cousin\u2019s bar mitzvah. (They said they were afraid she would distract their son during his speech.) I made my displeasure known, and soon we were both invited without another word. The problem: I\u2019m still so angry that I\u2019d like to punch my brother in the face. What should I do? ANNIE It is not uncommon for people to make mistakes, give way to bad impulses or even be unkind \u2014 especially when their \u201cbig days\u201d are involved. Your brother and sister-in-law erred. But they also corrected their error, though silently, as soon as you pointed it out. Hold your tongue (for now), attend the bar mitzvah with your daughter and try to have a good time. When you can speak to your brother and his wife without threat of screaming, tell them their behavior hurt your feelings. They will probably apologize. When they do, remind yourself that their mistake grew out of the same protective impulse for their son that offended your vigilance on behalf of your daughter. Then accept the apology and move on. A close friend and his wife had twins three weeks ago. My friend and I Skyped frequently during the pregnancy, discussing his excitement and fears. (I live 3,000 miles away.) When his wife went into labor, I got text updates from him every few hours. But when the babies were born, one had serious health issues that kept him in the NICU. Understandably, the updates stopped. Since then, a guy who lives close to them has been designated point person and sends updates every few days. But I want to know much more than these emails contain. I\u2019m desperate to speak with my friend. I don\u2019t want to make him feel bad, but it\u2019s hard for me to know so little of what\u2019s going on, and I feel that I deserve to be more in the loop. What should I do? ANNA You are clearly suffering from a small loss of perspective. This situation is not about you \u2014 or your desires \u2014 at all. Your dear friend is under great stress right now. Unless otherwise requested, your sole job, at a distance of 3,000 miles, is to shower him and his family with love and support. This excludes calls or messages that seek to guilt him into replying to you. To be clear, under no circumstances should your texts include the phrases \u201cdying to hear from you,\u201d \u201ctell me how you\u2019re doing\u201d or \u201cI miss speaking with you.\u201d Your sole message is: \u201cYou are not alone. I am here for you if you need anything, day or night. Pick up the phone whenever you want to talk.\u201d Trying to wheedle your way into more than that would be selfish \u2014 which I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t mean to be. (But even if you do, don\u2019t.)", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/fashion/son-needs-a-male-role-model.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T09:46:36-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T09:46:36-04:00", "abstract": "Also, insensitivity about a disability and learning to live with being out of the loop.", "title": "Does a Son Need a Male Role Model?"}
