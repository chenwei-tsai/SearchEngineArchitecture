{"text": "Dear Diary: I walked along Court Street a block from my home. One storefront away, a bulldog in an old, tattered green sweater lumbered along the sidewalk alone. She sniffed a blue mailbox. She turned, slowly, in a circle. She sniffed the mailbox again. Was she lost? Down the block, an older woman stood at a corner store with a bag. \u201cZelda!\u201d the woman yelled in my direction. I smiled \u2014 the dog had a friend \u2014 and headed toward home. A week later, returning from buying a bottle of wine, I saw the old dog meandering down the street, in a larger brown sweater this time. A few brownstones down, the same woman was waiting patiently by a gate. \u201cIs that Zelda?\u201d I shouted. \u201cYeah,\u201d the woman said. \u201cShe\u2019s always doing this to me.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/metropolitan-diary-a-bulldog-on-court-street.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:06-04:00", "abstract": "Getting acquainted with a neighborhood pet.", "title": "A Bulldog on Court Street"}
