{"text": "Before the recent March for Science, scholars and journalists debated the likely effect of the protest: Would it defend science against politicization or unnecessarily polarize the public on the value of the scientific enterprise? Some early evidence suggests the march may have widened the divide among liberals and conservatives in their views of scientists but not, crucially, toward the research they conduct. As a purely organizational matter, the protests seem to have been a success. A crowdsourced estimate compiled by political scientists puts the number who participated in the march in the United States at 334,000 to 525,000 people. But the effect of the science march on public opinion is less clear. Though partisan and ideological resistance to scientific findings is widespread in some politicized domains like climate change, overall confidence in the scientific community among both liberals and conservatives remains robust, especially relative to other institutions in society. In particular, though the intensity of support has declined somewhat among conservatives, overall confidence remains largely stable. In the 2016 General Social Survey, for instance, approximately 40 percent of respondents said they had a great deal of confidence in the scientific community, an essentially identical result to 1977 (41 percent) and 1991 (40 percent). Support for science, in other words, is less polarized than many people believe. The fear that many observers have expressed (including me) is that events like the march could spread the polarization observed on contentious issues like climate change to views of science more generally. \u201cIf science begins to be seen as a \u2018liberal\u2019 pursuit\u201d in this way, wrote Megan Mullin, an associate professor of environmental politics and political science at Duke University, \u201cit risks losing public favor.\u201d Were these fears realized? Some preliminary evidence is available from Matthew P. Motta, a doctoral candidate in political science at the University of Minnesota who tracked opinions toward scientists and scientific research among a sample of survey respondents recruited on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk workplace. Though these participants are not representative of the general public, we can still conduct a valid test for polarization by comparing how the views of liberals and conservatives in the sample changed from before the march to afterward. (Eight in 10 respondents reported having heard at least something about it, including approximately one in two who said they heard a \u201cmoderate amount\u201d or a \u201cgreat deal.\u201d) Between the Wednesday before the march (April 19) and the Monday and Tuesday afterward (April 24-25), liberals and conservatives in the survey panel moved further apart in how warmly they felt toward scientists. Specifically, liberals reported somewhat warmer feelings toward scientists (up to 86 from 82 on a 0-to-100 feeling thermometer scale) while the feelings of conservatives toward scientists became somewhat less warm (down to 67 from 70). The liberal-conservative gap in agreement with the statement that \u201cScientists care less about solving important problems than their own personal gain\u201d also widened significantly \u2014 conservative agreement increased to 32 percent, up from 22 percent, whereas liberal agreement fell to 8 percent from 11 percent. However, no corresponding increase in polarization was observed on the statements that \u201cMost scientific research is politically motivated\u201d and \u201cYou simply can\u2019t trust most scientific research.\u201d On the latter question, for instance, agreement did not change significantly among conservatives (22 percent agreed before the march compared with 21 percent afterward) or liberals (6 percent agreed before the march; 3 percent did afterward). This finding suggests that the polarizing response that the march elicited toward scientists did not spill over into views of the research they conduct. Mr. Motta cites the emphasis on the marchers in news coverage as a potential explanation for these findings. In an email, he writes that \u201cthe \u2018public face\u2019 of the march appears to be the protesters; the clever signs they came up with, dressing as dinosaurs, etc.\u201d This focus on the scientists who participated, he writes, \u201cput a human face on science, which might be why it led to polarization with respect to attitudes about people, but not necessarily their research\u201d \u2014 a topic that received less attention. These findings should be evaluated in future studies, but they suggest another way in which science can become politicized \u2014 not by challenging the findings of a field of research, but by portraying the people who do science as political. In this sense, the march and events like it could paradoxically make scientists a more inviting target for future attacks.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/upshot/how-marching-for-science-risks-politicizing-it.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "The Upshot", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T05:30:25-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T05:30:25-04:00", "abstract": "If science begins to be seen as a \u201cliberal\u201d pursuit, one researcher said, it risks losing public favor.", "title": "How Marching for Science Risks Politicizing It"}
