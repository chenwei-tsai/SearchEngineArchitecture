A month later, the planes hit the twin towers and the next day, she told him that she was moving to New York. They made a well-received duet together on a mattress in his Hell\u2019s Kitchen apartment, and the following year he invited her to help him start a dance company. That troupe, Keigwin + Company, has earned fans and praise for its spirited, witty ensemble work with a knack for showmanship. But this week, Mr. Keigwin and Ms. Wolcott zoom in on their own relationship in \u201cPlaces Please,\u201d an intimate cabaret for two at Joe\u2019s Pub. Conceived as a peek into backstage, preshow preparations, the evening charts the ups and downs of making dance and making it in New York\u2019s dance world, told through movement and memories culled from their 16-year collaboration. It\u2019s a campy snapshot of the creative process, and a tribute to a long, entertaining friendship.
