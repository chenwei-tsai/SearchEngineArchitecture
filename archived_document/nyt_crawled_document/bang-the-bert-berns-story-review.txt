As it happens, a new documentary about Berns\u2019s too-short life (he died in 1967 at 38), \u201cBang! The Bert Berns Story,\u201d reveals that he resolved to take more control over his music after witnessing Mr. Spector botch one of his songs in a studio session for Atlantic Records. That was \u201cTwist and Shout,\u201d written by Phil Medley and Berns (under the name Bert Russell), and Berns was able to rescue it a year after Mr. Spector and the Top Notes\u2019 version, this time with the Isley Brothers. The ensuing R&B smash was soon covered by the Beatles, and Berns got down to working on both sides of the pond. Directed by Bob Sarles and Berns\u2019s son Brett, with narration written by the Berns biographer Joel Selvin (also interviewed here), the documentary packs a lot of showbiz lore into its brisk running time. Did you know that the  Strangeloves\u2019 \u201960s hit \u201cI Want Candy,\u201d of which Berns was a writer and producer (and which was later a New Wave \u201980s hit for Bow Wow Wow), got its title from Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg\u2019s best-selling dirty-book parody? Narrated by the musician and rock arcana maven Steven Van Zandt, the film begins with Berns\u2019s birth in the Bronx, and a sentence of death: heart disease spurred by childhood rheumatic fever. Much is made of Berns\u2019s motives in writing, with Jerry Ragovoy, what would be one of his biggest hits, \u201cPiece of My Heart,\u201d sung by Erma Franklin. Berns would not live to hear Janis Joplin\u2019s version. There\u2019s some juicy stuff here, including much about the intersection of the music business and the mob. As Mr. Selvin bluntly states, \u201cBert walked with gangsters, walked with killers, and he exalted them.\u201d The movie strikes an uneasy balance of romanticizing the connections and making the cleareyed observation that show business and criminality have always had, for complicated reasons, a close relationship. There\u2019s also an astonishing parade of interviewees. Even the notoriously taciturn Van Morrison, who had a sometimes fraught relationship with Berns, turns up and is quite generous in his assessment. The industry legend Jerry Wexler, of Atlantic Records, also a principal in Berns\u2019s own label, Bang, goes from villain to mentor to villain again. Neil Diamond\u2019s absence becomes highly explicable as the story of his quarrel with Berns unfolds. If you love the music Berns made, you\u2019ll love this movie; if you don\u2019t, I feel for you, but \u201cBang!\u201d might nevertheless entertain with its dish.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/movies/bang-the-bert-berns-story-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:54:58-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "title": "Review: \u2018Bang!
