{"text": "To the Editor: In reading your May 1 editorial about President Barack Obama\u2019s remuneration for his Cantor Fitzgerald speech (\u201cThe Cost of a Speech\u201d), I felt a bit put out by what seems to be a somewhat pejorative finger-pointing attitude toward his post-presidency. What this dignified and elegant man endured during his presidency from those who have acquired power should exempt him from this premature criticism of what appears to be a carefully thought through strategy for his appearances. He just might be the right man at the right time to help save us from ourselves, and for that, he can charge whatever he wants.
