{"text": "PARIS \u2014 The campaign of the French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron confirmed on Friday that it had denied the pro-Kremlin media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today accreditations to cover the rest of his campaign. On Sunday, after it became clear that Mr. Macron and Marine Le Pen would face each other in the election runoff on May 7, the news media descended on Macron headquarters. But journalists from RT, Sputnik and Ruptly, a Russian video news agency, were denied access. Other Russian media outlets were accredited for the event, according to a spokeswoman for the campaign, who said RT and Sputnik were considered \u201calternative media\u201d that produce \u201cpropaganda.\u201d In a weekly briefing in Moscow on Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria V. Zakharova, described the decision as \u201coutrageous.\u201d She said the \u201cprohibitive measures\u201d were \u201cpurposeful and blatant discrimination of the Russian media by a candidate to the presidency of a state that historically stood up for freedom of speech.\u201d Ms. Zakharova said the decision was in line with previous \u201cunsupported accusations against RT and Sputnik\u201d made by the Macron campaign, and she called on the French authorities \u201cto pay special attention to the violation of media rights in the course of the presidential elections.\u201d The French authorities and security experts have for months warned of the risk of election meddling by Russia, either through slanted or fake news, trumpeted by pro-Kremlin outlets, or through cyberattacks. It may well be that Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign has experienced all of them. The decision to bar the Russian outlets came on the heels of a report by the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro that Russian operatives had targeted Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign. Those operatives have also been linked to the hacking of Democratic Party officials before the presidential election in the United States last November. In February, Richard Ferrand, the secretary general of Mr. Macron\u2019s movement En Marche!, or Onward!, warned that the campaign\u2019s databases and websites had been hit by \u201chundreds, if not thousands,\u201d of attacks from inside Russia. As on most subjects, Ms. Le Pen and Mr. Macron\u2019s views on French-Russian relations differ vastly. Ms. Le Pen, whose earlier presidential bids have been partly financed by Russian loans, has supported lifting sanctions against Moscow that were imposed after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. She also met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia before the French election. Mr. Macron, after some wavering, adopted the European Union\u2019s position that sanctions could not be lifted until the Minsk agreements, which aimed to resolve the Ukraine crisis, had been fully implemented.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/world/europe/france-macron-russia-sputnik-rt.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T17:55:01-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T17:55:01-04:00", "abstract": "A spokeswoman for the presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said the two outlets, RT and Sputnik, were considered \u201calternative media\u201d that produce \u201cpropaganda.\u201d", "title": "Macron Denies Access to 2 Russian Media Outlets in French Campaign"}
