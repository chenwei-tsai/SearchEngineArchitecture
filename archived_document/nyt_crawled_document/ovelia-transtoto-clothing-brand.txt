Is it trends?\u201d she asks. \u201cThe definition is blurry. For me, creative expression takes the form of clothing \u2014 an object that someone can wear. You take two-dimensional fabric and turn it into a three-dimensional thing, and the number of stitches or the angle of the cuff can completely change the garment.\u201d Transtoto began to obsessively tinker with things while growing up in Jakarta, Indonesia. \u201cI was driven by a desire to transform whatever was in front of me,\u201d she says. She remembers following her own so-called recipes and concocting homemade sweets, or drawing on blank address labels and selling them as stickers to her friends. She took up pottery and studied under the ceramic artist Keng Sien Liem, but moved to London at age 26, where she earned a degree in fashion design from Central Saint Martins. After graduation, she freelanced \u2014 mainly creating and consulting on prints for other brands \u2014 met an adept pattern-cutter (\u201che\u2019s my lifeline, he can make anything happen,\u201d she says) and found a top-notch local factory. During this period, Transtoto fine-tuned her creative process. She calls herself \u201cnot so much of a mood-board person,\u201d and instead likens herself to a D.J. \u201cA D.J. takes a song that you might\u2019ve heard before, and he puts it in his mix and it becomes entirely new,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that comes from the past but feels fresh, and it can change how you feel about that particular music,\u201d she continues. She designs with Zaha Hadid; architects, she says, \u201csee that clothing is more than a piece of cloth. They can read objects and can understand the story behind things \u2014 they would probably be able to understand what my clothing is about.\u201d In March of last year, Transtoto packed a small collection into a suitcase and went to Dover Street Market in London, where she worked as part-time shop assistant. Each of the six women\u2019s wear designs she brought was somehow adjustable; for example, tugging on the straps of a jacket turned a oversize silhouette into a tighter, body-conscious style. \u201cI wanted to give people options so they could make the garments their own,\u201d she says. The store picked up her debut collection for the fall 2016 season. Transtoto designed a larger follow-up offering for spring, and her autumn/winter 2017 collection will soon come to DSM\u2019s London, New York City, Singapore and Ginza locations, as well as retailers like Maryam Nassir Zadeh, SSense and La Gar\u00e7onne. The garments combine opulent Old World forms and functional fabrics. This means floor-grazing mermaid-tail skirts cut from wool and jersey, high-waisted wrap skirts made from a custom-developed pleated fabric, loosely ruffled T-shirts, cropped and flared trousers and a sculptural coat (that contains a hidden hood) lined in Thinsulate, a synthetic thermal fabric used for the most intense outerwear. She notes that the last item, her favorite design, ticks all of her boxes \u2014 it is technical in construction, aesthetically pleasing and utilitarian. \u201cI want to make good products that people can live in,\u201d Transtoto says. \u201cYou could wear my stuff on a freezing mountain or to the opera \u2014 you could run out to grab milk without anyone looking at you like you\u2019re an alien.\u201d", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00"}
