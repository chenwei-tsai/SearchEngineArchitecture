Since the earliest days of social media, The Times has published on a host of social platforms. Now we\u2019re adding Snapchat Discover to the mix. Not there yet? Fear not. Here\u2019s a look at what it is, how it works and why we\u2019re there. Two years ago, The New York Times started telling stories on Snapchat, a social messaging and storytelling platform. The goal was to present our journalism in a highly visual way. Snapchat stories are compilations of videos and photos strung together over a 24-hour period. And each frame expires exactly 24 hours after posting. The result is a visual rough cut narrative. Since we launched, we\u2019ve taken you to rural Angola, brought you along with us on the red carpet at the Grammys, shown you what it\u2019s like on Air Force One. We\u2019d tell you to go watch them on Snapchat, but of course, they\u2019re long expired by now. When we wanted a creative way to visually explain the Electoral College, we turned to Snapchat. (Spoiler alert: M&Ms are involved.) And when we wanted to invite all our readers to Sam Sifton\u2019s house for Thanksgiving ... well, we invited them on Snapchat instead. We\u2019re going to continue telling stories on our Snapchat account and you can follow us. But you can also find us, starting today, on Discover \u2014 Snapchat\u2019s home for content from news and media organizations.", "abstract": "Since the earliest days of social media, The New York Times has published on a host of platforms.
