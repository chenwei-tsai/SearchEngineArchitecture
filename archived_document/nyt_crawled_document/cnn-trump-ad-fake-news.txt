{"text": "The head of President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign accused CNN of \u201ccensorship\u201d on Tuesday afternoon after the broadcast network refused to run the group\u2019s latest advertisement. CNN said it would run the 30-second television spot, a celebration of Mr. Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, only if the campaign removed a section that featured the words \u201cfake news\u201d superimposed over journalists from CNN, MSNBC, PBS, ABC and CBS. In response to the network\u2019s decision, Michael Glassner, the executive director of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign committee, called the decision \u201ccensorship pure and simple.\u201d \u201cBy rejecting our ad, CNN has proven that it supports censorship is biased and fears an opposing point of view,\u201d Mr. Glassner said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s loyal supporters know the truth: The mainstream media mislead, misguide, deceive, and distract.\u201d In the advertisement, a narrator claims that \u201cAmerica has rarely seen such success,\u201d before listing several purported achievements from Mr. Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know it from watching the news,\u201d he says, before the words \u201cfake news\u201d are briefly displayed. CNN defended the decision in a statement on Twitter. \u201cThe mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false,\u201d  the network said. \u201cPer our policy, it will be accepted only if that graphic is deleted.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/business/media/cnn-trump-ad-fake-news.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T15:48:04-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T15:48:04-04:00", "abstract": "The network said it would not take money to broadcast a falsehood in the ad.
