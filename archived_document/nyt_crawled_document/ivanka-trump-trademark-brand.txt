{"abstract": "The president\u2019s daughter, now a White House adviser, has filed 173 foreign trademarks in 21 countries, as well as in Hong Kong and the European Union.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "LONDON \u2014 Ivanka Trump calls her father a homebody. \u201cIf it were up to him, he\u2019d seldom leave New York,\u201d she once wrote. By contrast, she has been her family\u2019s leading globalist \u2014 doing deals around the world in her father\u2019s name and her own. Even since her father took office, her own fashion brand has continued to look abroad, filing four new trademarks in Canada and the Philippines, according to a New York Times analysis of trademark records. The continued activity is tricky territory for Ms. Trump\u2019s new job as White House adviser. While she has stepped down from both her own fashion company and from the Trump Organization and put her brand in a trust, she has not given up her financial control, an unusual situation to navigate now that she is subject to federal ethics rules on conflicts of interest. Even though many of her trademark applications were filed long before she took her government job, they could be decided on by foreign governments while she works in the White House, creating ethical issues with little precedent. Earlier this month, China approved three new trademarks for Ms. Trump\u2019s brand on the same day she met China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, according to an Associated Press report. Japan also approved trademarks in Ms. Trump\u2019s name in February that included footwear, handbags and other apparel, records show. And trademark applications in Ms. Trump\u2019s name are awaiting decisions in 10 countries, the Times analysis showed, including Kuwait, Qatar, Panama and Brazil. Ms. Trump has long been conducting a corporate two-step, trying to build her own global brand as she has helped push her father\u2019s name into new parts of the world. Over all, Ivanka Trump Marks L.L.C., her trademarking business, has filed 173 foreign trademarks in 21 countries, as well as in Hong Kong and the European Union, in little more than a decade, according to the Times analysis. There are probably more, since there is no single repository of all global trademarks. All of the applications on record took place before she was a White House adviser. Ms. Trump\u2019s previous role as an informal adviser to President Trump had already raised questions. She is a woman with a multitude of overseas business ventures who since the election has been afforded prime seating at meetings with a who\u2019s who of foreign leaders \u2014 from Justin Trudeau to Shinzo Abe to Angela Merkel. Now such issues become more complex. While presidents are exempt from federal conflict of interests law, Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, another senior White House aide, are not. As such, they are barred from making decisions in government that could benefit their financial holdings, which are worth as much as $740 million, according to recent filings. They are also covered by the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause barring federal officials from accepting \u201cany present, emolument, office or title of any kind whatever from any king, prince or foreign state.\u201d Whether trademarks run afoul of such rules is a matter of debate between the Trump administration and its critics. Trademarks are certainly valuable assets as companies seek exclusive control over their global brands, and Ms. Trump herself has said that the first step in building a brand is to \u201cdo a comprehensive trademark search.\u201d Ms. Trump has taken steps to separate herself from her company. Her brother-in-law and sister-in-law serve as trustees, while Abigail Klem, her brand\u2019s president, runs the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. But she has kept her financial interest in the company, and retains the ability to approve or veto certain deals through her trust arrangement. Ms. Trump also maintains a stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, just down the street from the White House. \u201cWhen they weren\u2019t going into the White House, I thought there was a lot of leeway there,\u201d said John Pudner, the executive director of the conservative nonprofit Take Back Our Republic. Now, he said, \u201canything can be viewed as influence.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s bad for the administration,\u201d added Mr. Pudner, who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cIt could call into question any decision made, people wondering if there\u2019s a business angle to it.\u201d The White House referred comments to the Trump Organization, which did not comment. Ms. Klem, president of Ms. Trump\u2019s brand, said in a statement, \u201cThe brand has filed, updated and rigorously protected its international trademarks over the past several years in the normal course of business, especially in regions where trademark infringement is rampant. \u201cWe have recently seen a surge in trademark filings by unrelated third parties trying to capitalize on the name, and it is our responsibility to diligently protect our trademark.\u201d Ms. Trump has long had an international outlook. In her 2009 book, \u201cThe Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life,\u201d she credited the influence of her mother, Ivana, for her own love of travel. And not long after she joined the Trump Organization in 2005, she helped lead her father\u2019s business abroad. \u201cBefore my brothers and I joined the company, our business was primarily a New York-based operation,\u201d she wrote in her book, adding that her father would say, \u201cThere are plenty of great deals right here in New York.\u201d It was not long before she began to concurrently push her own brand in many of the same markets as her father\u2019s. While she was overseeing the development of a controversial Trump Tower in Azerbaijan, which has since been abandoned, she was also filing trademarks for her own brand, for clothes and cosmetics. In China, while she was helping her father\u2019s company make inroads, she developed her own following, taking out at least 23 trademarks for everything from swimwear to wedding dresses, both to battle locals trying to infringe on her name and to support her own interests. Ms. Trump has a following in China, where young professionals often equate material wealth with success. A video of her daughter singing in Chinese even went viral. But for many Chinese, Ms. Trump is the epitome of the fuerdai, a Mandarin expression that means \u201crich second generation,\u201d a term provoking a mix of respect and resentment. A spokesman for the brand said several of its licensees wholesale products in China. More than a dozen of Ms. Trump\u2019s own Chinese trademarks were filed during the election campaign. In Manila, Ms. Trump was the linchpin for a new Trump Tower rising in Makati City, a project that \u201ccame about from a meeting that took place between Ivanka and I,\u201d Robbie Antonio, the son of a prominent Filipino developer, once said in a promotional video. Ms. Trump\u2019s friendship with Mr. Antonio is not hard to understand. He has a bit of Trumpian flair himself \u2014 an art collector who once commissioned a Rem Koolhaas-designed home filled with portraits of himself. Ms. Trump and Mr. Antonio have also been involved in a plan to sell her jewelry in the Philippines, but a spokesman for the brand said it did not have any current plans to open a store there. And records show her business has applied for three new trademarks in the country this year. It is not clear how Ms. Trump, now a federal employee, will navigate continuing ties to far-flung foreign business interests. Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a left-leaning watchdog group, said that if Ms. Trump\u2019s brand was trying to expand operations or import from other countries, there could be \u201cmeaningful interaction\u201d with foreign governments. Foreign companies, too, might also try to cut special deals with the brand to curry favor with the Trump administration, Mr. Weissman added. \u201cThen you get into the issue about improper influence,\u201d he said. Jamie Gorelick, a Washington ethics lawyer who is acting as an independent adviser to Ms. Trump\u2019s trust, has said that the trust prohibits Ms. Trump\u2019s brand from reaching deals with foreign governments or state-owned enterprises. For Ms. Trump, the risks may be necessary. Helping steady her father\u2019s presidency could be critical to preserving the appeal of both her brand and her father\u2019s. Certainly, his scorching rhetoric has led to a complicated period for Ms. Trump\u2019s brand, both at home and abroad. Her business interests have faced boycotts, and Nordstrom, citing poor sales, said in February that it would no longer sell Ms. Trump\u2019s shoes and clothes. There was also a backlash to the backlash, as online sales of Ivanka Trump-branded products skyrocketed right after Nordstrom\u2019s decision, according to Lyst, a fashion e-commerce site. Ms. Trump also made waves in China in February by posting a video of her 5-year-old daughter, Arabella, singing in Chinese on Instagram, a move some saw as aimed at soothing raw feelings between China and the Trump administration. And in March, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d featured a sketch, starring Scarlett Johansson, that had Ivanka selling a perfume called \u201cComplicit.\u201d (She recently told CBS, \u201cIf being complicit is wanting to, is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I\u2019m complicit.\u201d) \u201cEverything she does,\u201d said Mr. Weissman of Public Citizen, \u201cis effectively an advertisement for the Ivanka Trump brand.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/business/ivanka-trump-trademark-brand.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T14:45:28-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Ivanka Trump\u2019s Global Reach, Undeterred by a White House Job", "created_date": "2017-04-18T14:45:28-04:00", "section": "Business Day"}
