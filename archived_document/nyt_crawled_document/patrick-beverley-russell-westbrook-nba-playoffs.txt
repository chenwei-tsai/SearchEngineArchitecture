The ad, which was making its debut, was for Patrick Beverley\u2019s summer basketball camp for children: Camp Lockdown. If anyone was curious about the meaning behind the camp\u2019s name, Beverley made it obvious once the game began. As the Rockets eased their way to a 118-87 victory in Game 1 of their first-round series, Beverley applied an inhumane amount of defensive pressure on the Thunder\u2019s Russell Westbrook, who labored through one of the more difficult games of his career. Westbrook shot 6 of 23 from the field and committed nine turnovers. Doug Bibby, the director of Beverley\u2019s summer camp, was thrilled \u2014 thrilled with Beverley\u2019s defense, thrilled that the Rockets had graciously agreed to run the ad before the game (and again at halftime) and thrilled with the timing of it all. \u201cBig ups to the Houston Rockets!\u201d Bibby said Monday afternoon in a telephone interview. Beverley, a 6-foot-1 guard, was at his dynamic best in the series opener, the best pitchman possible. In addition to his suffocating defense, he collected 21 points and 10 rebounds while shooting 8 of 13 from the field. He also survived a bruising collision with the Thunder\u2019s Steven Adams in the second half, which was perhaps a sign of more physical play to come in the series. After the game, Beverley appeared utterly unfazed. Asked about the play involving Adams, Beverley turned to a television camera. \u201cGood screen, Steve,\u201d he said. To those who know him best, it was classic Beverley \u2014 the intensity, the feistiness, the willingness to absorb contact while doling out a bit of it himself. His teammates see this type of stuff from him all the time. But he still managed to lift his play against Westbrook, the favorite to win the Most Valuable Player Award this season. \u201cIncredible,\u201d Eric Gordon said. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Trevor Ariza said. Houston Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, who cautioned against reading too much into one win, compared Beverley, a fifth-year pro, to Raja Bell, a former guard who played for D\u2019Antoni when he was coaching the Phoenix Suns. Like Beverley, Bell was beloved by teammates for his relentless approach and was loathed by opponents for being a total nuisance. \u201cTo have that type of competitive spirit, you don\u2019t find it too often,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty rare.\u201d James Harden, who led the Rockets with 37 points, said Beverley\u2019s effort level in Sunday\u2019s game was no different than it had been all season. \u201cHe brings it every game,\u201d Harden said. \u201cHe brings that intensity, that dog that we need.\u201d It is not a style that can be easily mimicked, but Beverley wants to at least try to influence the next generation of players \u2014 and he plans to start with a group of campers for a week in mid-July. In addition to the usual summer-camp staples like ball-handling, shooting and teamwork, Camp Lockdown will have one particular point of emphasis. \u201cDefense,\u201d Bibby said, \u201cand playing it like Patrick does.\u201d Bibby, the boys\u2019 basketball coach at Central High School in Louisville, Ky., runs basketball camps in the summer, including one for the Chicago Bulls\u2019 Rajon Rondo. Rondo and Beverley are represented by the same agency, BDA Sports, which reached out to Bibby when Beverley expressed an interest in staging his own camp this summer. Last month, Bibby visited with Beverley and his family to map out a plan. They found a facility outside Houston. They agreed on the general setup. Beverley even had a friend design a logo: a silhouette that features Beverley\u2019s facial hair and his self-proclaimed nickname, Mr. 94 Feet, a nod to his willingness to cover the entire court. \u201cNot a lot of guys in the N.B.A. want to defend,\u201d said Bibby, whose cousin Mike Bibby played 14 seasons in the league. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a guy like Westbrook who can score 40 points on any given night and you\u2019ve got a guy like Patrick Beverley who says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to step up to that challenge for this entire series,\u2019 that takes a load off of a lot of people.\u201d In his own way, Beverley is a more realistic role model than many N.B.A. stars. He was a second-round draft pick. He is not a giant. He does not have saucepan hands like the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 Kawhi Leonard or the impossible reach of the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo. But Beverley is an elite defender all the same. \u201cFor kids, it makes you think that the dream of playing in the N.B.A. is attainable,\u201d Bibby said. \u201cHe plays with heart. He plays with emotion. To me, you can have all the athletic ability and height in the world. But if you don\u2019t have the passion or the intellect to play the game the right way, it doesn\u2019t matter how tall you are or how big you are.\u201d Ahead of Sunday\u2019s game against the Thunder, Bibby had 10,000 fliers for Camp Lockdown printed up. Fans found them on their seats when they arrived at the arena, and then the ad played overhead. Bibby was grateful that the Rockets were willing to help get the word out.
