{"text": "TRENTON \u2014 Amtrak officials said on Friday that overhauling the tracks and rail equipment at Pennsylvania Station in New York would require two or three significant disruptions to commuting schedules over the summer. Precisely when the disruptions would occur and how long they would last, however, the officials could not say. They said they would meet next week with officials of commuter railroads in New Jersey and New York to decide how to schedule the track closings to limit their effects on the 600,000 train riders who pass through Penn Station each weekday. Amtrak should be ready to lay out its plan for the weekday disruptions by the week of May 8,, the railroad\u2019s chief executive, Charles W. Moorman, told lawmakers at a hearing in Trenton. Mr. Moorman said Amtrak\u2019s goal was to finish the most complicated repairs by Labor Day, and to then resume working on the tracks only at night and on weekends. He said he did not know how many weekdays would be disrupted but that \u201cit\u2019s certainly not going to be every day this summer.\u201d Mr. Moorman said the disruptions would affect riders who use Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road, all of which share the tracks and platforms at Penn Station, North America\u2019s busiest rail terminal. Amtrak, as the landlord at Penn Station, has drawn up a schedule for the work and will give officials with the commuter railroads a chance next week to respond to it and to suggest changes, Mr. Moorman said. \u201cWe are eager to work collaboratively together with New Jersey Transit,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, our organizations have a very good relationship at the ground level.\u201d Steven Santoro, New Jersey Transit\u2019s executive director, testified at the hearing after the Amtrak officials. He told lawmakers that his staff had just received the Amtrak proposal and had not had a chance to assess it. The plan to schedule track work at the station on weekdays is a change for Amtrak, whose traditional approach has been to limit work to late nights and weekends. But a series of derailments and other problems at and around the station in the past several weeks prompted Amtrak officials to alter their strategy. Assemblyman John McKeon, a Democrat, referred to a timeline of recent train troubles displayed on screens in the hearing room as a \u201c30-day nightmare.\u201d He said it was hypocritical of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to blame Amtrak for the problems, given that Mr. Christie, a Republican, had canceled a project meant to double the capacity for commuter trains between New Jersey and New York City. \u201cThe fact that the governor has the temerity to blame anyone but himself, pointing at Amtrak, is astounding to me,\u201d Mr. McKeon said. On Thursday, Mr. Christie told reporters that he had been right to threaten to withhold payments to Amtrak for maintaining the station because Amtrak had accepted responsibility for the derailments and had decided to accelerate repairs. Mr. Santoro said that Mr. Christie\u2019s goal in making the threat was to get Amtrak\u2019s attention. \u201cI think that attention\u2019s been got,\u201d Mr. Santoro said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/amtrak-penn-station-disruptions.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T17:28:55-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T17:28:55-04:00", "abstract": "Amtrak\u2019s chief executive could not say exactly when the disruptions would occur or how long they would last, only that \u201cit\u2019s certainly not going to be every day this summer.\u201d", "title": "Penn Station Work Will Cause 2 to 3 Major Weekday Disruptions, Amtrak Says"}
