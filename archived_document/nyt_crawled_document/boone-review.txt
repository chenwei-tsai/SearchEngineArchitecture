{"text": "Anyone used to the convenience of city living should feel a tad guilty expressing impatience with \u201cBoone,\u201d a loving portrait of a goat dairy farm in Jacksonville, Ore., from the photojournalist Christopher LaMarca. If you buy milk of any kind, it\u2019s only fair to see what happens before it reaches the store. Over 75 minutes, Mr. LaMarca\u2019s documentary watches three farmers toil over feeding, milking, bottling, chopping wood, picking vegetables and tending to goats giving birth. Some of the most humane scenes show the farmers simply going about their lives, caring for a dying dog or dancing while cooking. Even so, \u201cBoone\u201d is slightly monotonous, and familiarity may be one cause. Quite a few strong documentaries have already explored the decline of American rural traditions, including \u201cSweetgrass,\u201d a near-abstract immersion in the sights and sounds of a Montana sheep drive, and \u201cPeter and the Farm,\u201d a harrowing character study. There are also drawbacks to Mr. LaMarca\u2019s noninterventionist approach. Although we hear a snippet of a news report and a brief discussion of how the enterprise can\u2019t support both its needs and the farmers\u2019, the film provides scant context for Boone Farm\u2019s financial distress. When an end title card attributes the farm\u2019s closing to \u201cregulations preventing the sale of raw milk and cheese,\u201d the film points an accusatory finger having never made a case. Unmediated footage can be edited polemically, as in Frederick Wiseman\u2019s films, but \u201cBoone\u201d seems resigned to sidelong glances, confident that merely observing farm life, including some spunky animals, is enough.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/boone-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:49:59-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:49:59-04:00", "abstract": "A documentary observes life \u2014 births, milking and vegetable picking \u2014 on a goat farm in Oregon.", "title": "Review: Lovingly Tending the Livestock in \u2018Boone\u2019"}
