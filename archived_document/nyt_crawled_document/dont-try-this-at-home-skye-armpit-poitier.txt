For every really prolific constructor who seems to be able to throw one of these together without much effort, there is an Adam Fromm, who takes the craft so seriously that he stopped making them rather than make puzzles that weren\u2019t up to his standards. You have to admire that kind of thinking. Here is a man who wants your crossword to be so entertaining that he worked on today\u2019s puzzle intermittently over seven years. And he kept at it until it was polished and ready to see daylight. Kudos also to Will Shortz, who has unending patience. The result is a very entertaining, sparkling puzzle, with so much going for it. Mr. Fromm explains the areas that he feels are both strong and weak, and I tend to agree with him. But I would like to point out how hard it is to use this sort of 15-letter \u201chashtag\u201d grid design and make most of the 15s really interesting, while cramming the rest of the puzzle with good fill. And, as Mr. Fromm says, there are those corners. It always comes down to those tricky, tricky corners. The northwest corner that Mr. Fromm worked so hard on is beautiful, with HEBRIDES, AQUILINE, JUICEBOX and \u201cJACKASS THE MOVIE\u201d crossing RICK SPRINGFIELD, who was famous for his song \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl\u201d and his role on \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d but to me will always remind me of being chased by the police around Carnegie Hall because two dolts that I went to high school with talked me into helping them sell what turned out to be counterfeit concert T-shirts. We also have BAD IDEA, MAKING DO, BITE ME, A RAISIN IN THE SUN, ATALANTA, SEX TAPE, SINO-JAPANESE WAR and EDIE FALCO. Mr. Fromm shows a lot of talent for themeless construction, and I hope we get to see more of them in the future. \u25a0 19A: Hi, yes, if you need me, I\u2019ll be in the profanity filter, picking out comments that mention the entry \u201cJACKASS THE MOVIE.\u201d Don\u2019t try this at home. \u25a0 24A: Do PREPPY people wear ascots? I know of Izod/polo shirts, khakis and Top-Siders. \u25a0 32A: The answer to \u201cLe Monde material\u201d is PAPIER, the French word for \u201cpaper,\u201d because of the French name in the clue. \u25a0 43A: Wordplay alert! This made me laugh. \u201cChange one\u2019s tone?\u201d could mean that you are adjusting how you speak to someone, or it could mean that you are getting a TAN. \u25a0 58A: \u201c\u2018Jezebel\u2019 costume\u201d for RED DRESS is based on the 1938 Bette Davis film, \u201cJezebel,\u201d where the 19th century protagonist, Julie Marsden, wears a RED DRESS to a ball where unmarried women are expected to wear white. \u25a0 25D: Not your calf. The clue \u201cWhat may involve the calf muscles?\u201d for RODEO refers to the muscles of a baby cow.
