{"text": "Over his career, James C. Woolery has ventured from the law to investment banking and hedge funds. Now the veteran deal maker is preparing to return to life as a lawyer once more, at his third law firm in six years. Mr. Woolery plans to announce on Monday that he is joining King & Spalding, a firm that aims to join the top rungs of the legal industry. There, he will serve as the head of the firm\u2019s mergers and corporate governance practices, overseeing both takeovers and defenses against activist investors who want to shake up companies. \u201cGiven his background and r\u00e9sum\u00e9, his deal list and his experience, it\u2019s a significant hire for the firm,\u201d Robert D. Hays, King & Spalding\u2019s chairman, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Woolery said he wanted to help companies be more proactive in warding off activist investors. He will also help guide King & Spalding\u2019s network of lead board directors, who take leadership roles on boards, on discussions of corporate governance practices. \u201cWhat we want to do is try to innovate around the whole spectrum of corporate governance, including activism and shareholder relations,\u201d Mr. Woolery said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring not only a legal but also an economic analysis to the effort, as well as get beyond the traditional confrontational approaches.\u201d Mr. Woolery first rose through the deal industry at the white-shoe law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he made partner and worked on big deals involving the likes of Universal Health Services and Air Products. In 2011, he followed in the footsteps of several former Cravath partners and jumped over to investment banking, joining JPMorgan Chase as co-head of the bank\u2019s North American mergers practice. Two years later, he returned to the law, heading to the two-century-old Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft as deputy chairman and anointed successor to the firm\u2019s chairman. Yet Mr. Woolery zagged again in 2015, when he and a former JPMorgan colleague founded Hudson Executive Capital, an activist hedge fund with a twist: It would never wage a hostile fight against a company, instead preferring to press for change on friendly terms. Mr. Woolery resigned from Hudson Executive last autumn. As he weighed his options, King & Spalding began to reach out. Mr. Woolery knew of the firm, as well as some of its partners. One, William Calvin Smith III, was in his undergraduate class at Wake Forest University. For King & Spalding, the chance to bring in a well-known deal maker offered the prospect of greater prominence in one of the most profitable legal practices around. Long known as one of Atlanta\u2019s top firms, King & Spalding did not make the top 20 of American legal advisers on mergers, ranked either by dollar volume of announced deals or by number of transactions, according to data from Bloomberg. But it has been growing rapidly. The firm now has 1,000 lawyers in 19 offices across the world, having opened up outposts from Silicon Valley to Switzerland to Saudi Arabia. Its net income has risen 60 percent over the last five years, according to Mr. Hays, the chairman. Profits per partner now total about $2.5 million, according to the publication American Lawyer. For Mr. Woolery, who focused on building out Cravath\u2019s business development during his time there, joining King & Spalding means working to give the firm more of the stature held by mergers stalwarts like Cravath; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; or Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. \u201cWhen you go to a business that\u2019s more mature, that has its advantages and its disadvantages. A powerful brand is an important thing,\u201d Mr. Woolery said. But he added of his new firm, \u201cin legal circles, they\u2019re making up tremendous ground all the time.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/business/dealbook/james-c-woolery-king-spalding.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T07:10:17-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T07:10:17-04:00", "abstract": "The law firm with roots in Atlanta is expanding aggressively and hopes to increasingly compete in the business of doling out deal advice.", "title": "James C.
