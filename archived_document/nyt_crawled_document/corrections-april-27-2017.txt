{"text": "INTERNATIONAL An article on Wednesday examining whether Western populism is advancing or receding misspelled the surname of a political scientist who wrote a recent paper about European elections. He is Ronald Inglehart, not Ingleheart. NEW YORK An article on Tuesday about New York City\u2019s mayoral race, using information from Republican Party officials, erroneously attributed a distinction to one candidate, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis. She will not in fact be the first woman to run for mayor of New York City as a Republican. (Diane McGrath ran as a Republican in 1985, losing to Mayor Edward I. Koch.) BUSINESS DAY An article on Tuesday about money that Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, stands to receive if shareholders vote to sell the company\u2019s internet businesses to Verizon Communications misstated the amount of Snap stock owned by Yahoo. The company owns 4.6 million shares valued at $98 million, not 2.3 million shares valued at $49 million. \u2022 An article on Tuesday about efforts to build flying cars referred incorrectly to the timing of an offer in which consumers pay $100 to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of one such vehicle, a Kitty Hawk Flyer. They can do so now; they do not have to wait until later this year. \u2022 An article last Thursday about the closing of Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, Calif., referred incorrectly to the entity that formed a subcommittee in 2015 to explore options for the law school. It was the Whittier College board of trustees, not the \u201cWhittier Law School board.\u201d (There is no such board.) SCIENCE TIMES An answer in the Q. AND A. column on Tuesday about drugs that can cause dry mouth referred incorrectly to one kind. Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs, not a single drug called benzodiazepine. OBITUARIES An obituary on Monday about the actress Erin Moran, who played Joanie on the television show \u201cHappy Days,\u201d misstated the number of seasons that series was broadcast. It was 11, not 10. EDITORIAL  An article on Tuesday, about President Trump\u2019s proposed cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, misstated the percentage of large pollock trawlers overseen by federal observers. It is 99 percent, not 80 percent. The Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.
