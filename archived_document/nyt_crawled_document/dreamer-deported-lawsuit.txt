Lawyers for the immigrant, Juan Manuel Montes, 23, who had been living in the United States since age 9, said he was the first recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, to be removed from the country. \u201cHis case is emblematic,\u201d said Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, one of the parties that filed the lawsuit. \u201cIt shows that people with valid DACA may be at risk despite President Trump\u2019s statements to the contrary.\u201d According to the complaint, filed in Federal District Court in Southern California, agents with Customs and Border Protection \u201carrested, detained and physically removed\u201d Mr. Montes after stopping him while he was walking in the border town of Calexico, Calif., on Feb. 17. Ms. Hincapi\u00e9 said that Mr. Montes, who is cognitively impaired because of a brain injury he suffered as a child, told agents that he had left his wallet, with his documents, in a friend\u2019s car. They denied his request to have a relative retrieve them, she said. Mr. Montes was taken across the border to Mexicali, Mexico, where he stayed with a friend. After being beaten and robbed while walking on the street, he tried to re-enter the United States around Feb. 19, but he was quickly detained and sent across the border again, the lawsuit said. \u201cI was forced out because I was nervous and didn\u2019t know what to do or say, but my home is there,\u201d Mr. Montes said in a statement released by the National Immigration Law Center. DACA recipients can be stripped of that status for certain criminal activities. Ms. Hincapi\u00e9 said that Mr. Montes, who first received DACA protection in 2014, has a record of four misdemeanors: three for driving without a license and one for shoplifting. The website for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that administers the DACA program, says that driving without a license will not disqualify someone from the program, but that a person\u2019s \u201centire offense history\u201d can be considered. Ms. Hincapi\u00e9 said Mr. Montes\u2019s record would not have made him ineligible. The immigration service did not respond Tuesday night to a request for comment on the lawsuit, which was first reported by USA Today. In March, Mr. Montes\u2019s lawyers filed a Freedom of Information Act request with Customs and Border Protection asking for all records of his interaction with its agents. The agency acknowledged the request, but it has so far not provided the information, according to the lawsuit, which seeks the release of the records. About 750,000 young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children have benefited from DACA since it was introduced in 2012. During his campaign, Mr. Trump said he would rescind the program. But despite pursuing tougher measures toward illegal immigration, he has since suggested that he would seek a favorable solution for DACA recipients, known as Dreamers. That has dismayed some conservatives who believed that President Barack Obama had overstepped his authority in creating the program. Representative Steve King, an Iowa Republican with a history of inflammatory statements about immigrants, applauded Mr. Montes\u2019s deportation with a barbed message on Twitter on Tuesday. Ms. Hincapi\u00e9 said it was \u201cespecially disconcerting\u201d that Mr. Montes was deprived of a hearing before an immigration judge, in violation of his due process. Several DACA beneficiaries have been detained in recent months. One, Daniela Vargas, was arrested after sharing her family\u2019s story at a news conference protesting Mr. Trump in Mississippi. Ms. Vargas, who had failed to renew her DACA status, was detained for a week. Another beneficiary, Daniel Ramirez Medina, was arrested outside Seattle and released last month after spending six weeks in detention. Immigration officials said he had confessed to gang affiliation, an accusation Mr. Medina denied.", "item_type": "Article"}
