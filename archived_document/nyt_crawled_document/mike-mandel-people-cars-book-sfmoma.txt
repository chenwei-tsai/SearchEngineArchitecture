His new book, \u201cPeople in Cars\u201d out next month, does just that: It\u2019s a collection of snapshots he took in 1970s California as a 19-year-old kid. \u201cI grew up in Los Angeles and all of my experience of being in L.A. was about going from one place to the other by car,\u201d he recalls. He saw the automobile as an American icon and a home in itself, where people would spend hours of their time. Walking to an intersection half a block from his house, he began to take candid photographs of drivers. He used a wide-angle lens, which required him to stand close to the cars. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was looking at them from a distance \u2014 I wanted them to respond to me in some way,\u201d he explains. And respond they did: the images show couples grinning at him, children scowling, and one lady flipping a manicured finger. \u201cI think today there might have been a lot more paranoia about being surveilled or something, but in those days it was maybe a more na\u00efve time. For the most part, people thought it was kind of funny, and responded in a jovial way, and I had a lot of fun doing it.\u201d The work came at the beginning of a prolific period for Mandel \u2014 \u201cWhen I see what I was able to do in the \u201970s, I really feel guilty about the stuff that I can do right now,\u201d he says, chuckling. Next month, SFMOMA opens \u201cGood 70s,\u201d a retrospective of the many projects he completed that decade, including \u201cBaseball-Photographer Trading Cards\u201d and \u201cSeven Never Before Published Portraits of Edward Weston\u201d; a surreal sense of humor runs through them all. Revisiting the 75 rolls of film he shot for \u201cPeople in Cars,\u201d Mandel says he has been surprised by the fresh perspective he brings to it now. Today, he\u2019s intrigued by the subtle details that he paid no attention to as a teenager, like the reflections captured in the windows of the cars. \u201cIt was interesting to go back and relook at something that you did 45 years earlier, and realize that you saw things then that you didn\u2019t really appreciate until you were much older,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of cool for me.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T12:57:08-04:00", "section": "T Magazine", "abstract": "In the 1970s, the 19-year-old Mike Mandel shot 75 rolls of film for a project he called \u201cPeople in Cars.\u201d Now, it becomes a book \u2014 and part of an exhibition at SFMOMA.", "item_type": "Article"}
