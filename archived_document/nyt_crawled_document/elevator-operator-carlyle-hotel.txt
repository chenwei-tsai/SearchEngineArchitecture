{"text": "Ociric Beato, 40, is an elevator operator at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. Q. Do you find it boring standing in an elevator all day, pushing buttons and asking people, \u201cWhat floor, please?\u201d A. People ask me that all the time. Sure, it can get a bit boring basically working in a windowless box. But imagine the ever-changing parade of interesting people I interact with. Everyone has to use one of our two elevators, so until they reach their floor, I try to engage them, even if it\u2019s just for a minute or so. How do you do that? I\u2019m a bit of a natural social butterfly, but in this case I have only about 30 seconds, so I start with a proper greeting and make a little eye contact. Or I try light humor, like, \u201cYour chariot awaits.\u201d I break the silence with universal things like the weather or sports. Anything to help people feel comfortable. I read body language very well, so I can tell right away if someone would prefer not to chat. Aren\u2019t manually operated elevators rare these days? I\u2019m definitely one of a dying breed. Only a few Manhattan hotels still have elevator operators. With 12 salaried operators, our owners and management company, Rosewood, could eliminate these jobs to save money, but they say we\u2019d lose our personal touch. Plus, we serve as security backups. We are the eyes and ears of the hotel. How did you end up with this job? I studied radiology technology at a community college in the Bronx, but I realized it wasn\u2019t for me. I continued in an accounting program in Queens. But then I got married, had kids and quit school to look for a job. By then, my father had been working in the kitchen at the Carlyle for more than 20 years. He recommended me, hoping I would tire of it and pursue something more ambitious. But I really took to it. I\u2019ve been here 18 years. What do you do personally to think outside the box, so to speak? Music has always been my outlet. I never played an instrument, but as far back as high school, I was going to rap clubs in Manhattan. Now I\u2019ve built my own sound studio at home in Brooklyn. I write and perform my own material, combining modern rap with reggae to form reggaeton. I have also written merengue and bachata music, which is from the Dominican Republic, where my parents were born.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/jobs/elevator-operator-carlyle-hotel.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Job Market", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T12:13:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T12:13:07-04:00", "abstract": "When you\u2019re a social butterfly, punching buttons in a windowless box can actually be fun.", "title": "Boring Job?
