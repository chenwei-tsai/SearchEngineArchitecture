Rupp, a three-time Olympian making his Boston debut, was 21 seconds behind, and Suguru Osako of Japan was another 30 seconds back. Americans had six of the top 10 finishers in the men\u2019s race and two of the top four in the women\u2019s race. Edna Kiplagat, a Kenyan police officer, won the women\u2019s race in 2:21:52, needing only one try in Boston to add to wins in London, New York (in 2010) and Los Angeles. She pulled ahead of Rose Chelimo of Bahrain in the Newton hills to win by 59 seconds. \u201cWhen I was running, my body was feeling good,\u201d said Kiplagat, who was greeted at the finish line by two of her children. Kiplagat had a comfortable enough lead to go back at one point and get the correct water bottle after grabbing the wrong one. Jordan Hasay of the United States, making her debut at the distance, was third, and Desi Linden fourth; it was the first time since 1991 that two American women finished in the top four. The warm temperatures, which hit 79 degrees at the 20-kilometer mark, slowed the runners, but a strong tailwind delivered a boost \u2014 especially in the wheelchair races. Marcel Hug won Boston for the third time, outpushing the 10-time champion Ernst van Dyk and finishing in 1:18:04 to beat the course record and world best by 21 seconds. His fellow Swiss Manuela Schar shattered the women\u2019s mark by more than five minutes, winning in 1:28:17. The winners\u2019 times on the point-to-point Boston course are considered a world best, and not a world record, because of the possibility of a supportive tailwind like the one on Monday. \u201cThe wind is so important,\u201d Hug said. \u201cThe roads were good. Everything was fantastic today.\u201d Earlier Monday, city officials announced plans for memorials to mark the sites where two bombs exploded during the 2013 Boston Marathon. City officials and the families of five people who died in the bombing or its aftermath say there is also a plan to build a separate, larger memorial to victims, survivors and responders. Pablo Eduardo is a Massachusetts resident and internationally known sculptor. He will create the memorial markers on Boylston Street where bombs killed three spectators and wounded more than 260 others. Eduardo said Monday that his goal was to \u201cembody the spirit of those we lost and the spirit of the city they loved.\u201d"}
