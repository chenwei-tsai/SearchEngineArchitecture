{"text": "President Trump has proclaimed Monday to be \u201cLoyalty Day,\u201d a time for Americans to reaffirm their commitment to \u201cindividual liberties, to limited government, and to the inherent dignity of every human being\u201d with Pledge of Allegiance ceremonies and a display of American flags. Monday, however, is also expected to be a major day of protest for those who oppose the administration and its policies on issues ranging from women\u2019s rights and worker\u2019s pay to health care and immigration. Hundreds of thousands people are expected to take to the streets of cities that include Los Angeles; Miami; Milwaukee; New York; Raleigh, N.C.; and Scranton, Pa. Corporations including Google and Facebook are giving workers the opportunity to march without fear of retribution. Labor and immigrants\u2019 rights activists have called for a general strike to boycott Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. There is a long tradition of protest around the world on May Day, known in most other countries as International Workers\u2019 Day. But the last time any May Day swelled streets across the country with large numbers was in 2006, when more than a million people in hundreds of cities took part in a \u201cDay Without Immigrants\u201d to protest federal legislation that would have made it a felony to live in the country without legal status. Then, the marchers sought immigration reform. The demands this time around are more basic: To many would-be marchers, even a return to the status quo before Mr. Trump was elected would feel something like a win. \u201cTrump has pitted the U.S. working class against migrant workers and refugees, and so we must strive to create bridges, not bans or walls, to connect our struggles together,\u201d representatives of the International Migrants Alliance wrote in its call to assemble on May 1, describing Mr. Trump as \u201ca brazenly fascist, racist and anti-immigrant president.\u201d In New York, a day of demonstrations will culminate in an evening rally at Foley Square. In Los Angeles, groups marching for gay rights, immigrants, workers and women will gather at MacArthur Park. Racial justice activists are also expected to turn out across the country. The administration has called for government buildings to display American flags and for schools to honor the occasion with recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance. President Obama also proclaimed May 1 as Loyalty Day and previous presidents have chosen days other than May 1.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/may-day-loyalty-day-protests-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T09:47:59-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T09:42:58-04:00", "abstract": "Hundreds of thousands are expected to protest the Trump administration\u2019s policies on Monday, a day that the president has proclaimed to be \u201cLoyalty Day.\u201d", "title": "On May Day, Protesters Expected to Take to the Streets"}
