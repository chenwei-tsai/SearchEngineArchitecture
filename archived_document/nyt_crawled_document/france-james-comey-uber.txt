Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 \u201cThis is deadly serious now.\u201d That\u2019s how one of the losing candidates described the results of Sunday\u2019s presidential voting in France, in which Marine Le Pen, the far-right firebrand, advanced to a runoff against the centrist Emmanuel Macron on May 7. Ms. Le Pen has tried to distance her National Front party from its racist, anti-Semitic roots, but a majority of people surveyed in polls say it represents a threat to democracy. The major parties are uniting against her, our correspondent in Paris writes. We have detailed maps showing how France voted, in what was a rebuke of mainstream parties. Our journalists across Europe analyzed the results as they came in, and we look at the possible effects on the euro. We\u2019ll have more coverage today of the election, which could decide the future of the European Union. \u2022 Back in Washington, and headed for a cliff. Lawmakers face a deadline as they return today from a two-week recess: Government funding runs out on Friday. Here\u2019s what to watch for. The White House is eager to project progress ahead of President Trump\u2019s 100th day in office this Saturday. He said he would reveal a proposal for a \u201cmassive\u201d tax cut on Wednesday. A government shutdown would be difficult for Republicans to explain, as they control both houses of Congress as well as the White House, our Washington correspondent writes. \u2022 How the F.B.I. shaped the election. James Comey, the bureau\u2019s director, has largely tried to keep out of politics. But during investigations of both the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns, he made decisions that shaped the contours, if not the outcome, of the presidential race. Four Times reporters went behind the scenes and found that while partisanship was not a factor in Mr. Comey\u2019s approach to the inquiries, he handled them in starkly different ways. \u2022 This is not your father\u2019s flying car. More than a dozen start-ups backed by deep-pocketed figures in the tech industry \u2014 along with big aerospace firms like Airbus, the ride-hailing company Uber and even the government of Dubai \u2014 share a belief that regular people should be able to fly their own vehicles around town one day. \u2022 \u201cThe Daily,\u201d your audio news report. On today\u2019s show, the real story of the F.B.I. director and the 2016 election. Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. \u2022 Since taking over at 21st Century Fox two years ago, James and Lachlan Murdoch have seemed determined to rid the company of the old-guard culture on which their father, Rupert, built his media empire. Part of that generational change was the decision last week to end Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s reign at Fox News, a departure that signals a new era for prime-time cable news. \u2022  Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, exhibits a pattern of risk-taking that has sometimes put his company on the brink of implosion. \u2022 Among this week\u2019s headlines to watch: Wells Fargo will try to reassure shareholders after it released a scathing report two weeks ago on its sales scandal. \u2022 U.S. stocks were down on Friday. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 There\u2019s no one method for staying married, but embracing change sure helps. \u2022 High-impact activities may be just that: Running and jumping can improve bone health. But brisk walks and other light, whole-body vibration exercises help, too. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Make a better chicken salad. No, wait: Make the best. \u2022 Thousands of scientists and their supporters, feeling threatened by the policies of the Trump administration, gathered on Saturday in Washington and  around the world to support scientific enterprise. \u2022 The Rangers will face the Ottawa Senators in the second round of the N.H.L. playoffs. If basketball is more your thing, we\u2019ve got the latest on the N.B.A. playoffs, too. \u2022 \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d remained No. 1 at the North American box office for a second week, as five new movies arrived in wide release but failed to impress. \u2022 Meet the Morning Briefing\u2019s new sibling. The Times introduces a daily edition today on Snapchat\u2019s Discover platform, inspired by the briefing. (More than 1.5 million people get our briefing each day.) \u2022 The legacy of genocide. At least 1.7 million people died when the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. In today\u2019s 360 video, tour a prison-turned-museum that explains the history of the Cambodian genocide. Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. We visited the Ghetto Fighters\u2019 House, the world\u2019s first Holocaust museum. Take a moment to appreciate the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched aboard the shuttle Discovery on this day in 1990. For 27 years, it has sent us images of celestial wonders, captured in stunning detail. The $1.5 billion telescope is the length of a school bus and orbits the Earth at about 17,000 miles per hour. It\u2019s expected to keep working until at least 2020. Hubble\u2019s first pictures lacked clarity because of problems with the telescope\u2019s mirror, necessitating a repair trip. All in all, Hubble has required five major repairs, replacements or upgrades, the last of which was in 2009. The reward? Gorgeous photographs like the one here of the so-called Pillars of Creation, part of the Eagle Nebula nearly 7,000 light years from Earth. And this recent close-up of Jupiter, 415 million miles away. Its successor, NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to launch in 2018. This telescope, equipped with a much bigger mirror, is designed to see deeper into space than Hubble, and may solve mysteries about how the first stars and galaxies were created.
