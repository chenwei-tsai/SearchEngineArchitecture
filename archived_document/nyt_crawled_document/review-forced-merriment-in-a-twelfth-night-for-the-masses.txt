{"text": "A quiet little celebration is happening over at the Public Theater, honoring 60 years of its Mobile Unit, which takes Shakespeare to the people with performances in New York City community centers, correctional facilities and shelters, and then at the Public itself. \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d this spring\u2019s play, has wrapped up its five-borough tour and is now onstage at the mother ship. In honor of the anniversary, all tickets are free. It\u2019s a lovely gesture, but a customary ratcheting down of expectations is in order. Directed by Saheem Ali, vaguely set in coastal Florida and sprinkled with Spanish, this frantic staging does offer some amusements \u2014 chief among them, David Ryan Smith as a wonderfully prissy Malvolio, and Donnetta Lavinia Grays as a teasing, protean Feste. But it also suffers the fate of many an outreach show produced by institutional theaters, including the Public: It\u2019s not as good as the usual fare. That\u2019s not because of the streamlined physical design. The show does fine with unchanging overhead lighting, and the flat square (by Arnulfo Maldonado) that forms the stage is tricksy enough to transform briefly and cleverly into the roiling sea where the twins of the tale, Viola (Danaya Esperanza) and Sebastian (Sebastian Chacon), are separated before washing ashore, each assuming that the other has drowned. Disguising herself as a young man named Cesario, Viola gets a job with a duke, Orsino (Michael Bradley Cohen), who is unrequitedly in love with the haughty Olivia (Ceci Fernandez). Adored by her own servant, Malvolio \u2014 even the pattern of his baby-blue pajamas, by Dede Ayite, is a tribute to her \u2014 Olivia is smitten with Cesario, who is (supposedly) a dead ringer for Sebastian. Mistaken-identity high jinks ensue, as does a practical joke on Malvolio by the clownish Sirs Toby (Christopher Ryan Grant) and Andrew (Mr. Cohen) and their chum Maria (Aneesh Sheth). It\u2019s a convoluted and ridiculous plot that demands clarity in performance but mostly doesn\u2019t get it from this erratic production, whose pared-down script (a feature of Mobile Unit shows) adds to the confusion. Mr. Ali\u2019s conceit is that Viola and Sebastian are Cuban refugees, but that doesn\u2019t come across onstage. The lively Latin and house music, performed by Ms. Grays and the show\u2019s composer, Michael Thurber, is entertaining, and the slow-growing attraction between Viola and Orsino is sweet. But there is an overwhelming forced merriment in the pursuit of laughs \u2014 a layering on of brightly colored wackiness that feels partly like desperation and partly like an attempt to dumb things down, as if by making the comedy broad enough it will be comprehensible by the masses. That\u2019s what rankles, despite the Mobile Unit\u2019s laudable mission. As Stephanie Ybarra, the Public\u2019s director of special artistic projects, said in her preshow introduction on Wednesday night, some of the places that this cast has performed \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d are \u201cdesigned to oppress and kill the human spirit.\u201d It is honorable to bring Shakespeare into those spaces. But mere worthiness is unworthy of the Public, which is in the business of making great art for the people of its city \u2014 all of them. Why should audiences in shelters and detention centers get less than top-caliber stuff? If it\u2019s a matter of resources, maybe the Mobile Unit should get more. Because surely its target audiences need the solace of Shakespeare at least as much as people who can afford to shell out for the next must-see production in from London or to spend hours in line for a free ticket to Shakespeare in the Park. Muddled Shakespeare can leave audiences blaming themselves for failing to get it \u2014 can, in fact, turn them off to trying it again. Shakespeare done brilliantly, though, is a revelation. And revelation is what the Public should be helping its Mobile Unit to achieve.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/theater/review-forced-merriment-in-a-twelfth-night-for-the-masses.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T11:10:32-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T11:10:32-04:00", "abstract": "The Public Theater\u2019s Mobile Unit winds up its five-borough tour of Shakespeare\u2019s comedy about mistaken identity.", "title": "Review: Forced Merriment in a \u2018Twelfth Night\u2019 for the Masses"}
