But Republicans were also pleased that they had forced Mr. Ossoff into a June runoff against a seasoned candidate that they believe their fractured party can unite behind. This closely watched race in the suburbs north of Atlanta has been widely billed as a referendum on Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, and local residents are girding themselves for a new bombardment of money and messaging as the two major parties fight for the chance to brand the Republican president as either damaged goods or wily survivor. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump, as divisive and catalyzing as ever, is waiting in the wings, amid speculation that he may be mulling a more personal involvement in the race that could end up stoking Republican excitement, Democratic anger \u2014 or both. \u201cI think we could be facing all-out war here for the next two months,\u201d Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, Ga., said Wednesday. Mr. Ossoff is a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker virtually no one had heard of until a few months ago. But he has become a sort of instant celebrity as liberals around the country sniffed weakness in a district that previously sent Newt Gingrich to Congress \u2014 but which Mr. Trump barely won in November. Activists have filled Mr. Ossoff\u2019s campaign chest with $8.3 million, and more is on the way: On Wednesday, Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, sent a fund-raising email encouraging party members to \u201cgo all-in and elect Jon,\u201d and \u201csend a big, loud message to Donald.\u201d Mr. Ossoff, one of 18 candidates on Tuesday\u2019s ballot, received a little more than 48 percent of the vote. He will face the Republican Karen Handel in a June 20 runoff to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price, who is now Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of health and human services. Ms. Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, finished first among 11 Republican candidates on Tuesday night with just under 20 percent of the vote. She has expressed support for Mr. Trump in the past, though not as fervently as some of the Republicans she bested on Tuesday. In a brief victory speech, she did not mention Mr. Trump at all. But in an appearance Wednesday morning on CNN, Ms. Handel said she hoped Mr. Trump would come campaign for her. \u201cIt\u2019s all hands on deck now,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake here.\u201d Mr. Trump is expected to be in the Atlanta area on April 28 to speak at a National Rifle Association event. It appears, from his Twitter account, that he has taken a keen interest in the race, and has offered his assistance: \u201cDespite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG \u2018R\u2019 win with runoff in Georgia,\u201d he wrote Tuesday. \u201cGlad to be of help!\u201d But even if he does not stump for Ms. Handel, his presence will be felt keenly in the runoff, with both candidates facing unique Trump-related dilemmas over the next few weeks. If Ms. Handel keeps a cool distance from the president, she risks alienating the most fervent pro-Trump voters. If she embraces him, she may lend ammunition to Democrats eager to portray Ms. Handel as his tool. Mr. Ossoff\u2019s problem has to do with outrage. The anger over the Trump presidency has been the rocket fuel that has powered his surprisingly successful campaign, unleashing not only a flood of out-of-state donations, but a formidable army of canvassers and telephone-bank volunteers. Whether that level of passion and involvement is sustainable remains to be seen. Democrats have a poor track record of turning up at midterm and special elections, and the June runoff comes during peak vacation season. Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, believes that Mr. Ossoff\u2019s supporters will remain motivated enough to return to the polls, and considers the race a \u201ctrue tossup.\u201d He noted that the conservative Tea Party movement, which bubbled up in early 2009, was still going strong enough to have a significant impact on the midterm elections in late 2010. \u201cThe anti-Trump sentiment, we\u2019ve seen that persist now since the election,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the indications are that it is still present, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to fade that quickly.\u201d Gina Rahman, 51, a mother, engineer and yoga instructor who has been volunteering for the Ossoff campaign since February, spoke this week as if she had no choice but to keep working through June. As she coordinated a pro-Ossoff sign-waving group in front of a polling place Tuesday in unincorporated East Cobb County, Ms. Rahman, an immigrant from Bangladesh, said she viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s policies as a flirtation with \u201ctribalism,\u201d and spoke of him as a threat to the environment and the country\u2019s democratic institutions. \u201cI ran a marathon,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ll run a marathon again.\u201d Critics say Ms. Handel, 55, is somewhat short on charisma, and note that she lost recent bids for governor and United States senator. But she has a loyal base of support in the district, having served as chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission and chief executive of a local Chamber of Commerce. In her campaign literature, she promotes her classic Republican stances: She is against abortion rights and for gun rights; advocates ending the Affordable Care Act and \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d; and boasts that she implemented a statewide photo ID system for voters \u201cto ensure only qualified U.S. citizens, not illegal immigrants, are able to vote.\u201d She has criticized Mr. Ossoff \u2014 a champion of abortion rights and other liberal causes who has said he is not running a \u201cpartisan campaign\u201d \u2014 as a \u201clightweight liberal.\u201d Charlie Harper, a longtime Georgia Republican operative and publisher of the political news site Georgiapol.com, said that Republicans who had voted for the other conservative candidates would naturally flock toward Ms. Handel, as would donors and prominent party members who were worried about playing favorites when so many Republicans were running. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be very comfortable with her,\u201d Mr. Harper said. \u201cUp until this point it really hasn\u2019t been an even fight. Democrats had everything going for them. They essentially had one unified candidate.\u201d Joe Webb, 70, a Trump supporter and retired project manager from Marietta, spent Tuesday waving signs in the district for Bob Gray, a more overtly Trump-aligned Republican. He said he considered Ms. Handel to be a RINO \u2014 a Republican in Name Only \u2014 but said he would be voting for her to keep Mr. Ossoff out of Congress. \u201cI thought about it all day, licked my wounds and said, O.K., she\u2019s got a fairly positive track record as a politician \u2014 she did get voter ID in the state of Georgia, which is a major accomplishment,\u201d he said Wednesday.", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
