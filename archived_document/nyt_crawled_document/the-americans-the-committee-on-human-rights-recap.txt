And that was despite seeing Elizabeth and Philip score what may be the greatest triumph of their careers: stealing a stalk of super wheat from a Mississippi field and delivering it to Gabriel, who planned to take it with him back to Moscow where it could help feed the hungry Soviet masses. \u201cI feel like one of the guys in the posters,\u201d Philip said as they squatted in the Mississippi mud \u2014 although, with his pony-tailed Southern-man disguise, he wasn\u2019t looking very heroic. The episode, titled \u201cThe Committee on Human Rights,\u201d also began with a tender moment: the conclusion of Paige\u2019s visit with Gabriel. She was pleased with his praise for her and her parents, and she saw that this spy thing wasn\u2019t just business. \u201cHe\u2019s like \u2014 your family,\u201d she said to Philip. Her spy antennas were out, though \u2014 she noticed the lack of photographs and realized they were in a safe house. Her meeting with Gabriel was warm and fuzzy, but its consequences weren\u2019t. Feeling a stronger sense of duty than ever, she dropped the bomb on Matthew, telling him she couldn\u2019t be his girlfriend anymore. It was a sad, awkward scene, with an emotional Paige flaring into anger and contradicting herself. Poor Matthew. It\u2019s hard enough to understand a teenager in the first place, let alone one who says \u201cYou don\u2019t know me\u201d when she means \u201cYou don\u2019t know I\u2019m a Soviet spy in training.\u201d When a distraught Matthew tried to grab her, Paige\u2019s reaction \u2014 an Elizabeth-like hard shove \u2014 shocked her as well as him. Where does this go? Nowhere good, I\u2019d guess. Paige\u2019s story could play out with her as the good and competent soldier, but all signs point toward an impending crisis. Elizabeth loves her daughter, but she\u2019s still clueless about the depth of Paige\u2019s anguish, telling Philip that Paige is basically O.K. (At some point the scales will fall off and Elizabeth will have to respond to Paige purely as her mother, and that will be a great moment in the show\u2019s history.) Leave it to Gabriel to see things clearly. As he left for Moscow, his last words to Philip were: \u201cYou were right about Paige. She should be kept out of all this.\u201d And the episode closed on Philip\u2019s shocked and alarmed expression. In that solemn goodbye scene \u2014 if it was our last sight of Frank Langella as Gabriel, it was an agonizing reminder of how great he was in the role \u2014 Gabriel confirmed Philip\u2019s fears about the methods of his K.G.B. employers. \u201cPeople were shot, worked to death in the camps,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cSome were counter-revolutionaries. But some \u2014 some hadn\u2019t done anything. Just people. I did it, too.\u201d He offered no reassurance about the greater good: \u201cI believed I was acting in the service of a higher purpose. But I was just scared.\u201d Philip was clearly worried about present practices as well. Elizabeth had carried out her assignment at the psychiatrist\u2019s office, stealing a document labeled \u201cCommittee on Human Rights.\u201d Philip asked Gabriel about it, and Gabriel casually said that it was information about people who were part of \u201ca well-organized opposition at home.\u201d Philip looked apprehensive, presumably at the thought that their work was being used against innocent dissidents. Back at home, Oleg was free of the C.I.A. This made his mother happy, but he didn\u2019t seem too excited about it \u2014 you had to wonder whether he would have been happier if the Americans had shown up. Later we saw him at an archive looking up his mother\u2019s file from the four years she spent in a gulag. This lined up with Gabriel\u2019s memories and also invoked the ghost of Nina Krilova. (The photograph of the young, haggard woman in the file looked a little like Nina at the end.) Nina\u2019s spirit also hovered over Stan and Dennis\u2019s second meeting with their potential recruit, Miss Kovalenko, who works at the Soviet news agency Tass. (The meeting took place at Rock Creek Park, so there were also associations with Martha Hanson\u2019s great escape.) The contact was jumpy, and honest Stan told her that, yes, if things went south she might spend her life in a Soviet prison. She walked away without making a deal, and Dennis was not pleased with his partner. Later, Stan learned from Wolfe that the success of his Oleg gambit had accrued a cost: The bosses wanted Stan taken out of counterintellgence. Wolfe protected Stan by saying that their current assignment was too important, which could be bad news for Kovalenko: Whatever concern he\u2019s shown so far, Stan has extra motivation to reel her in now. We\u2019ve probably seen the last of Mississippi, and there was some grim humor in our final looks at Deirdre and Ben, the Southern sexual dupes who weren\u2019t dupes. Deirdre surprised Philip with her American free-mindedness \u2014 she just wants him for sex \u2014 but he got the last laugh, using his new expertise with Lotus to steal the information leading to the wheat field. And Ben had a surprise of his own: While he was being watched by the Jenningses, it became clear that he was two-timing Elizabeth. We, and Philip, could see that it jolted her. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to care,\u201d Philip said. But he forgot that he was talking to the toughest woman in the Western Hemisphere. \u201cNo it isn\u2019t, Philip,\u201d she said. \u201cNot for me.\u201d The real comic relief of the episode, slight as it was, came from Stan, who decided to let his guard down a tiny bit and tried to explain to Renee what was bugging him at work, without giving anything away. After he told her about the \u201cthing\u201d that happened that almost got him fired, he seemed visibly relieved in a way no one else on this show is capable of being. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, the episode\u2019s funniest line. So we\u2019re still left wondering what\u2019s up with Renee. (Also, what was up with the stain on Philip\u2019s shirt in Kansas?) The show has been so ominously suggestive in her regard that it seems she must have a secret \u2014 unless she\u2019s the reddest of red herrings. In a gasp-inducing moment, Philip asked Gabriel flat-out whether she was \u201cone of us.\u201d Gabriel denied it, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re losing it, Philip,\u201d but he seemed to be protesting too much.
