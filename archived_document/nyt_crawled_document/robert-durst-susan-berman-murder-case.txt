{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Lynda Obst was watching the documentary \u201cThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\u201d two years ago when a chilling, decades-old memory began to surface. A film and television producer with a string of hits, Ms. Obst, 67, recounted her experience on Wednesday in a pretrial hearing in Superior Court in Los Angeles, where Mr. Durst is charged with the murder of a close friend, Susan Berman, in December 2000. Prosecutors contend that Mr. Durst shot Ms. Berman in the back of the head in her Los Angeles home to prevent her from telling the authorities what she knew about the disappearance of Mr. Durst\u2019s first wife, Kathleen. Mr. Durst has insisted that he is innocent of Ms. Berman\u2019s death and that he has no knowledge of what happened to his first wife. At the time Kathleen Durst vanished in 1982, Ms. Berman served as a shield between Mr. Durst and tabloid reporters eager to discover what had happened. Ms. Obst testified that Ms. Berman had revealed to her that she had tried to get the police off \u201cBob\u2019s back\u201d by making a phone call to Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, posing as Mr. Durst\u2019s wife, who was a student there at the time. The phone call, prosecutors contend, was designed to make the authorities believe that Mrs. Durst was still alive after she left the couple\u2019s home, 50 miles north of Manhattan. Over the years, Ms. Obst said she had forgotten the conversation. But \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d a documentary in which she appeared, brought it all back. Still, she did not immediately go to the police. \u201cI was afraid of the defendant,\u201d Ms. Obst told the court. \u201cHe kills witnesses.\u201d Ultimately, Ms. Obst did contact John Lewin, the deputy district attorney in Los Angeles who is leading the prosecution of Mr. Durst, out of a desire to \u201cdo the right thing,\u201d she said, and \u201cto do the right thing by Susan.\u201d Ms. Obst was one of a string of witnesses called by the prosecution in what are known as conditional hearings, in which testimony is taken from witnesses age 65 or older who could die or be killed before a trial, which, in this case, is likely to take place sometime next year. Ms. Obst was the second \u201cmystery witness\u201d to appear in the hearings \u2014 her name was not publicly revealed until she took the stand. The proceedings are taped in case the witnesses are not available later, and the defense is allowed to cross-examine the witnesses. But it is unclear if any of the testimony in these hearings would ultimately be admissible at trial. Kathleen Durst\u2019s body was never recovered, and Mr. Durst has not been charged in her disappearance. Ms. Obst testified that Ms. Berman had once told her, \u201cKathie was a coke head and disappeared.\u201d In 1982, when Mrs. Durst vanished, Ms. Obst was working with Ms. Berman to turn her recently published book, \u201cEasy Street,\u201d into a movie. Ms. Obst said she loved the book \u2014 her first film project \u2014 and Ms. Berman\u2019s take on growing up in Las Vegas, the privileged daughter of a mob boss. In an effort to impeach Ms. Obst\u2019s testimony, Dick DeGuerin, one of Mr. Durst\u2019s lawyers, repeatedly asked her why she had not disclosed her conversation to the authorities earlier, either when Ms. Berman was killed in 2000 or when Ms. Obst was interviewed by the producers of \u201cThe Jinx\u201d in 2011. Mr. DeGuerin\u2019s cross-examination of Ms. Obst is set to continue Thursday. Ms. Obst testified that Ms. Berman\u2019s admission about Mr. Durst had come up in a discussion of Ms. Berman\u2019s view of loyalty as an expression of love and that Ms. Berman often said her mother had died protecting the secrets of her gangster husband. Ms. Obst said she had told Ms. Berman at the time that she was taking on the role of her mother in protecting Mr. Durst\u2019s secrets, which, Ms. Obst recalled, Ms. Berman embraced as a \u201cpsychological revelation.\u201d The women\u2019s five-year effort to produce a screenplay failed, and the conversation was soon forgotten, Ms. Obst said. While viewing an episode of \u201cThe Jinx\u201d in March 2015 that explored whether Kathleen Durst or someone else had placed the phone call to the medical college, Ms. Obst said, her heart started racing. \u201cI realized people did not know she called Albert Einstein,\u201d referring to Ms. Berman. \u201cI realized I knew this fact.\u201d Ms. Obst\u2019s testimony complemented that of another witness, Miriam Barnes, who also testified about the phone call to the medical college. Ms. Barnes, 66, a psychiatric social worker, told the court that she had become friends with Ms. Berman in the early 1980s, when they lived in adjacent townhouses on the East Side of Manhattan. One day, Ms. Barnes testified, Ms. Berman called her, asking her to come over to her apartment right away. \u201cShe said: \u2018I have to tell you something. Don\u2019t ask me any questions,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barnes recalled. She said Ms. Berman was pacing back and forth in the vestibule of her apartment, where two chairs faced each other. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018I did something today,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barnes testified. \u201cShe said she did it for Bobby. It took her a while to get it out: \u2018If anything happens to me, Bobby did it.\u2019\u201d Ms. Barnes said that it was during this conversation that she learned that Mr. Durst\u2019s wife was missing. She said she had later read about the disappearance in a newspaper. Ms. Barnes said she had kept the conversation a secret for nearly 35 years, before friends persuaded her to talk to a New York Times reporter. After she appeared in an article about Ms. Berman in December, the prosecutor asked her to come to Los Angeles to testify. \u201cI was scared,\u201d Ms. Barnes testified. \u201cI didn\u2019t run in those circles.\u201d Of Mr. Durst, she added: \u201cHe was a very wealthy man who could do whatever he wanted.\u201d As Ms. Barnes left the stand Wednesday morning, a stone-faced Mr. Durst swiveled in his chair to follow her progress out of the courtroom, until one of his lawyers redirected his gaze toward the judge. Mr. Durst\u2019s lawyers indicated that they planned to call witnesses of their own, including a retired New York police detective and a supervisor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, as part of the hearings, which are scheduled again in July. In papers filed in Superior Court, Mr. Durst\u2019s lawyers stated that the detective\u2019s testimony would \u201csupport Mr. Durst\u2019s defense that he had no involvement in the death of Kathie Durst, and that the N.Y.P.D. was aware of other suspects.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/robert-durst-susan-berman-murder-case.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T07:00:30-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T07:00:30-04:00", "abstract": "Lynda Obst said her friend of Susan Berman admitted to posing as Robert Durst\u2019s missing wife in a phone call designed to mislead authorities.", "title": "Victim in Durst Case Revealed Damaging Secret, Film Producer Testifies"}
