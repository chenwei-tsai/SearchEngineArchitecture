{"text": "Jeffrey Delgado, an aspiring archivist from Queens College, has been telling friends that he went through yellowing documents and old photographs for an exhibit showcasing the history of the Floating Hospital. They all asked the same question: \u201cIs it still on a boat?\u201d The answer, as he learned from the some of the newest records he examined, is no. The Floating Hospital kept its name when it decommissioned its last vessel 15 years ago. But the material Mr. Delgado went through was high and dry in Long Island City, Queens, the Floating Hospital\u2019s base since it moved to a permanent home on land. Now the finds from the Floating Hospital\u2019s archives can be seen in an exhibition that he and two other archivists-in-training assembled under the supervision of full-fledged archivists at Citibank and the Queens Library. For generations, the Floating Hospital made medical care as carefree as a day at the beach by giving children a boat ride that included a checkup. It traced its origins to 1866, with rented barges, and its getaway mission to 1872, when The New York Times reported on newsboys playing in a park and observed that they would do well to get some fresh-air relief from the crowded, fetid city that they plied every day. Sean T. Granahan, the president and general counsel of the Floating Hospital, said it had 100,000 photographs and other evidence \u201cof our epic 150-year journey through health care\u201d that needed to be reviewed, assessed and preserved. The archive project came about when officials at Citibank put the Floating Hospital in touch with the Queens Library, which works with community-based organizations in Queens \u201cthat have amazing material but don\u2019t have archivists to make them available to the public,\u201d said Natalie Milbrodt, the library\u2019s director of metadata services and the director of its Queens Memory program. The library also maintains the Citi Center for Culture Queens Library Fellowship for graduate students like Mr. Delgado. So the Floating Hospital became an assignment for the three recipients of this year\u2019s fellowships. In addition to Mr. Delgado, they are Regina Carra, who like Mr. Delgado is working on dual master\u2019s degrees, one in history, the other in library science, and Pamela Griffin-Hansen, a candidate for a master\u2019s degree in library science and archives at St. John\u2019s University. Each received a stipend of $1,000. Kerri Anne Burke, the global curator of Citigroup\u2019s Citi Heritage Collection, said the students made recommendations on how to take care of the Floating Hospital\u2019s files and artifacts, and then went to work designing the exhibit. Mr. Delgado and Ms. Carra worked on the layout, while Ms. Griffin-Hansen prepared labels to go with the photographs and the items they had chosen. The exhibition fills six display cases near the food court in the Citigroup building at One Court Square in Long Island City. Among the items is a bell from the Helen C. Juilliard II, the second of the Floating Hospital\u2019s five vessels. Seeing it in the display case prompted a question: Did they ring it? No, Mr. Delgado said: \u201cWe\u2019re archivists.\u201d Another find was a guest log from 1899, with the names of everyone who boarded the ship. Mr. Delgado remembered what flashed through his mind as he picked up the log: \u201cI have to be careful with this book right now \u2014 it\u2019s really fragile.\u201d \u201cWe were jumping for joy because we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d find anything so well preserved,\u201d he said. \u201cI checked for water damage, like a good archivist should.\u201d But there was not much. \u201cThey didn\u2019t find any mold or the kinds of things you often find when you\u2019re looking at a collection for the first time,\u201d said Ms. Milbrodt of the Queens Library. She said that the Floating Hospital had \u201ckept their materials in really good condition.\u201d They also caught up on the organization\u2019s recent past. Terrorism doomed the floating part of the Floating Hospital. The organization abandoned ship after the 9/11 attacks. It turned its last vessel, anchored off Lower Manhattan, into an emergency clinic as the twin towers fell. In time, the vessel was moved to Brooklyn, where it was used as offices; the medical care was provided at clinics around the city that the Floating Hospital had opened in the 1990s. The Floating Hospital was also struggling financially, with $6 million in debt, according to Mr. Granahan. The group sold the ship, actually a barge, and refocused on land-based ways to provide care that would generate sufficient reimbursements. It now describes itself as the largest charity health care provider for families in the city\u2019s homeless shelters and domestic-violence centers. Not everything the archivists-in-training turned up went into the exhibit. \u201cI found a lot of blueprints of Seaside Hospital before it was a thing,\u201d Mr. Delgado said, referring to a nursery and medical care facility in New Dorp, Staten Island, that the Floating Hospital ran from 1881 until the mid-1960s. \u201cI wanted to incorporate them,\u201d he said, but they were too big to digitize and too fragile to mount in the display cases.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/a-hospital-no-longer-afloat-but-buoyant-with-memories.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T16:38:25-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T16:38:25-04:00", "abstract": "An exhibit of documents and photos from the Floating Hospital is on display in Long Island City.", "title": "A Hospital No Longer Afloat, but Buoyant With Memories"}
