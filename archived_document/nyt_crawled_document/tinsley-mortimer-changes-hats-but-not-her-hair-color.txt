{"text": "Over the past decade, Tinsley Mortimer has done a lot. For starters, she divorced her high school sweetheart, Topper Mortimer, wrote a novel titled \u201cSouthern Charm,\u201d starred in a much-maligned reality show called \u201cHigh Society,\u201d started a clothing line and inspired a Christian Dior lip gloss called Tinsley Pink. She has also relinquished her position on top of the New York social heap for a (relatively) quieter life in Palm Beach, Fla., where, last year, she was accused by the police of  trespassing on her on-again, off-again boyfriend\u2019s property. Through it all, one thing has remained consistent. Her hair color. This is thanks to Kyle White, a stylist at the Oscar Blandi Salon in Midtown Manhattan whom she has visited regularly \u2014 about every six weeks \u2014 even during her sojourn in South Florida. \u201cI had been doing my color with some other guy, and it was patchy and splotchy,\u201d Ms. Mortimer said the other afternoon while in Mr. White\u2019s chair. \u201cIt was an optical illusion,\u201d Mr. White said of her former hair. \u201cI was trying to figure it out like it was a Rubik\u2019s Cube.\u201d Ms. Mortimer, who grew up in Richmond, Va., said she was born a blonde. But brunette roots began to show, and she started highlighting in sixth grade. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my natural hair color in 20 years,\u201d said Ms. Mortimer, who is 41. \u201cBeing blond just makes me feel happier, like when the sun\u2019s hitting you. The blond pops. It\u2019s cheerful.\u201d As Mr. White wrapped Ms. Mortimer\u2019s hair with foil, he described her particular hue as \u201cmultitonal \u2014 a soft baby blond with a golden blond base; she has icy and buttery pieces.\u201d They met about 15 years ago through Lauren Santo Domingo, another onetime social queen bee who, in 2010, became a founder of an online fashion retail site called Moda Operandi. Ms. Mortimer and those icy and buttery pieces have returned to New York at a time when the term socialite isn\u2019t as fashionable as it once was. Socialites now identify themselves as \u201centrepreneurs or business women or moms,\u201d she said. \u201cThe word isn\u2019t used anymore,\u201d she continued. \u201cNot that I ever asked for it.\u201d There is another path for women formerly known as socialites. It\u2019s the path of the Real Housewife. This is Ms. Mortimer\u2019s. A few weeks ago, she marked her first appearance on \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York City,\u201d Bravo\u2019s long-running series, which has not had much luck with new cast members in recent years. (Jules Wainstein left after one season; Kristin Taekman and Aviva Drescher after two.) As Ms. Mortimer tells it, after her fracas in Florida in spring 2016, Sonja Morgan, a cast member whom she knew from the New York social circuit and whose hair is also colored by Mr. White, invited her to stay at her Upper East Side townhouse. One thing led to another. Ms. Mortimer jumped at the chance to get out of Palm Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s very small. Everyone knows your business, from a 15-year-old to a 90-year-old.\u201d She moved there, she explained, to get away from the spotlight: \u201cI wanted to be a beachy girl. I was over dressing up.\u201d But then, she said, she had a realization: \u201cI am not the beachy girl. I don\u2019t wear flip-flops and beachy dresses. I\u2019m not as poufy and girlie, but I am the girl who dresses up.\u201d Now, when Ms. Mortimer reminisces about her life in New York, she wonders why she ever wanted to leave it. \u201cOh, my God, I look back at all these magazines and I realize that I did a lot,\u201d she said, waiting patiently for her hair color to set. \u201cIt was an amazing time. I don\u2019t know why I wanted to walk away from that. I didn\u2019t realize the scale of it. I never saw myself as this big socialite, but from an outsider point of view, there was a lot going on.\u201d That included an appearance on \u201cGossip Girl\u201d and those eight episodes of \u201cHigh Society.\u201d \u201cIt was over-sensationalized and I got some flak for it,\u201d she said of the series. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d Mr. White returned to check her progress. \u201cI loved that show; you were like the sophisticated grande dame,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are just jealous of Tinsley.\u201d She smiled demurely at him in the salon mirror as Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cSorry\u201d played. She is a bit anxious, she said, about her return to reality television on a show where a co-star, Bethenny Frankel, has already described her as having \u201cthe whole world at her fingertips and kind of crashed and burned.\u201d But the series affords her the opportunity to return to Manhattan, and to do so with that new and all important accessory, a job. She expects to dip a toe in the social swirl, including reacquainting herself with charities in which she was once involved, such as New Yorkers for Children, a nonprofit on the gala circuit. But for now, she said, it\u2019s about \u201cgetting to know the city again.\u201d One thing about New York that Ms. Mortimer likes, she explained, as Mr. White smeared on the last bits of dye: \u201cIf you want to hide, you can hide.\u201d \u201cNew York is my town,\u201d she added.
