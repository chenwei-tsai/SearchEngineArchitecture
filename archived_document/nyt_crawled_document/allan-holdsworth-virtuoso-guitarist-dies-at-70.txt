{"abstract": "Mr. Holdsworth, whose talent amazed better-known peers like Frank Zappa and Eddie Van Halen, played in seminal bands including Soft Machine before making a series of solo albums.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "Allan Holdsworth, a self-taught guitarist whose protean, virtuosic style was a source of amazement even to his more famous peers, died on Saturday at his home in Vista, Calif. He was 70. The cause was a heart attack, said Leonardo Pavkovic, Mr. Holdsworth\u2019s former manager. Mr. Holdsworth forged a relentlessly exploratory approach to harmony, which he brought to bear on both the guitar and the SynthAxe, a guitarlike synthesizer that allowed him added control over his tone and flow. He had his own vocabulary of unorthodox chords, often involving far reaches across the fretboard. As a soloist, he executed lightning-fast melodies with remarkable fluidity. Reviewing a performance by Mr. Holdsworth in 1983, The New York Times\u2019s Jon Pareles wrote: \u201cHe pours out notes in a liquid rush without slurring a single one. His sense of harmony reveals itself in daring melodic extrapolations and in chords that are complex and impressionistic yet as transparent as folk music.\u201d Mr. Holdsworth played in a number of seminal ensembles throughout the 1970s, including the Tony Williams Lifetime, Soft Machine and U.K. But he never seemed to arrive at any band\u2019s moment of peak popularity, or to stick around long enough to accrue a major following. Intransigently committed to his own artistic vision, Mr. Holdsworth sometimes clashed with record labels. And though he was constantly self-critical and battled stage fright even into his later years, he drew breathless praise from many guitarists \u2014 including Frank Zappa and Eddie Van Halen, both of whom considered him to be at the top of the class. Mr. Holdsworth never thought much of his reputation as a musician\u2019s musician. \u201cI don\u2019t like playing to guitar players, actually. I\u2019d rather just play to ordinary people,\u201d he said in a  Canadian television interview in the 1980s. \u201cBut obviously it\u2019s difficult with this kind of music because no one ever really gets a chance to hear it, because radio won\u2019t play it. Because it\u2019s not jazz, they don\u2019t really know what to call it, so they don\u2019t know where to put it.\u201d Allan Holdsworth was born on Aug. 6, 1946, in Bradford, England. He never knew his biological father, and he was raised by his maternal grandparents, whom he called his parents. His grandfather, a factory worker, was an amateur jazz pianist. His favorite music when he was a child came from the saxophone, especially the recordings of John Coltrane. In an interview with the website guitar.com, he remembered Coltrane\u2019s impact on him: \u201cIt was almost like he had found a way to get to the truth somehow, to bypass all of the things that, as an improviser, you have to face.\u201d But Mr. Holdsworth\u2019s grandparents could not afford to buy him a horn, so at 17 he picked up an acoustic guitar that was lying around the house and taught himself to play. Throughout his life, he continued to prefer the sound of wind instruments. (He also taught himself the violin.) To avoid a choppy, percussive sound, he never strummed the guitar, even when playing chords. Instead he plucked each string with a separate finger. When playing lines, he avoided picking with his right hand, often letting his fretting hand do the work. Mr. Holdsworth started playing in local bands in the late 1960s. He later moved to London, where he first recorded with an experimental rock band, \u2019Igginbottom, in 1969. By 1972 he had joined the fusion group Tempest; the next year he was invited into Soft Machine, a seminal progressive-rock ensemble. But he left after two years when the American drum virtuoso Tony Williams, renowned for his work in Miles Davis\u2019s quintet, asked him to join Lifetime, which had been one of the first jazz-rock fusion bands to emerge. Mr. Holdsworth stuck around for two albums. He did stints in the late 1970s with the French jazz-rock band Gong, the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and the all-star band U.K. In 1979, struggling financially but eager to advance his career, he took out loans to release a solo album. (The first album under his name, \u201cVelvet Darkness,\u201d culled from rehearsal tapes, had been released by CTI in 1976 against his wishes, and flopped.) He called it \u201cI.O.U.\u201d In the early 1980s he moved to California, where Mr. Van Halen heard him and persuaded Warner Bros. Records to sign him. But Mr. Holdsworth chafed at the label\u2019s dictates, and he was dropped after releasing just one 24-minute record, \u201cRoad Games.\u201d On \u201cAtavachron\u201d (1986) and \u201cSand\u201d (1987), Mr. Holdsworth introduced the SynthAxe, which could be activated with a breath controller, bringing him closer to a hornlike inflection. He continued to record and perform over the next three decades. The album \u201cThe Sixteen Men of Tain,\u201d released in 2000, was a particular highlight. Mr. Holdsworth was married and divorced twice. He is survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Lynne Holdsworth; two daughters from his second marriage, Louise and Emily Holdsworth; a son, Sam, also from his second marriage; and a granddaughter. \u201cWhat he gave me was complete freedom and liberation,\u201d the drummer Gary Husband, who played with Mr. Holdsworth for 35 years, wrote of him in an email. \u201cHe came forward having developed from the instrument what he wanted the guitar to give him, which was completely other than what anybody else was doing with it. \u201cHe chased simply what he heard and what he loved.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/arts/music/allan-holdsworth-virtuoso-guitarist-dies-at-70.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T19:24:38-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Allan Holdsworth, Virtuoso Guitarist, Dies at 70", "created_date": "2017-04-18T19:24:38-04:00", "section": "Arts"}
