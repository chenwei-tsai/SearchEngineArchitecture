{"abstract": "An inquiry by the New York attorney general found that from 2004 to 2009, Harbert paid no state taxes on profits generated by the hedge fund then managed by Philip Falcone.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "The money manager Philip A. Falcone, who made billions of dollars betting on the collapse of the housing market a decade ago and later lost at least a billion dollars investing in wireless telecommunications, is no stranger to run-ins with regulators. In 2013, Mr. Falcone agreed to be barred from working in the securities industry for five years, an agreement stemming from violations at his former hedge fund, Harbinger Capital Partners. Now, some of Mr. Falcone\u2019s original financial backers from Alabama have reached their own regulatory settlement in a tax investigation. Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said on Tuesday that his office had reached a $40 million settlement with Harbert Management Corporation and several of its top executives over allegations that they had not paid state taxes for some of the most profitable years that Mr. Falcone was managing Harbinger, which was owned by Harbert. State officials did not accuse Mr. Falcone of any wrongdoing, and he was not part of the settlement. The tax settlement, which Mr. Schneiderman said was the largest recovery of its kind for the state, stemmed from a lawsuit filed under seal in 2015 by an unnamed whistle-blower. An investigation by Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office found that Harbert paid no state taxes on the profits generated by Harbinger from 2004 to 2009, even though the hedge fund and Mr. Falcone were based in Manhattan. \u201cHarbert Management made a clear choice to skirt the rules, and as a result, ordinary New York taxpayers were left footing the bill,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said. The whistle-blower triggered the investigation by filing a lawsuit under the state\u2019s False Claims Act, which was amended in 2010 to cover claims for unpaid taxes, and will receive a payout of roughly $8.8 million. Neil Getnick and Jordan Thomas, lawyers for the whistle-blower, said in an interview that their client wished to be anonymous for now. But the lawyers said their client\u2019s lawsuit should be a warning to other hedge funds operating in New York that may not be paying their fair share of state taxes. \u201cThis is a new tax evasion method where tax obligations are being shifted to another state,\u201d Mr. Getnick said. \u201cThere is a lot of potential liability here for the industry with multistate operations.\u201d The settlement said that Harbert and its executives did not pay any taxes on \u201chundreds of millions of dollars of performance fees generated by Harbinger\u201d and that by only paying taxes in Alabama, which has a lower tax rate than New York, the investment firm and its executives saved themselves money. In a statement, Harbert, which is based in Birmingham, Ala., said the firm and its executives \u201cadamantly deny that they committed any wrongdoing.\u201d The firm and the individuals made \u201ca commercial decision to settle this legacy issue,\u201d the statement said. Mr. Falcone, once one of the richest men in the hedge fund industry, is not a party to the settlement and is not required to pay any of the back taxes. He did not assume ownership of Harbinger\u2019s management company until the latter half of 2009, and technically he was an employee brought in by Harbert to run the fund and make the investment decisions during the time taxes were not paid. The settlement with Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office said Mr. Falcone indirectly benefited from Harbert\u2019s decision to have its \u201coffshore manager,\u201d or Harbert, pay all of its state taxes in Alabama. The filing said Mr. Falcone, as a New York resident, \u201cpaid lower New York State taxes as a result of a credit for tax these members paid to Alabama.\u201d A spokesman for Mr. Falcone did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Falcone made his initial claim to fame in 2008 when he earned billions for himself, Harbert and other investors by betting against the subprime mortgage market on the eve of the financial crisis. The assets of Harbinger soared to about $26 billion, and he and his wife, Lisa Maria, became overnight celebrities, giving money to charity and buying the Manhattan mansion once owned by Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse Magazine, for $49 million. But Mr. Falcone\u2019s image as a successful investor was damaged after he invested billions in a wireless company, LightSquared, that filed for bankruptcy in 2012. A few months later, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged him with market manipulation, by giving preferential treatment to several big investors who wanted to redeem their money and borrowing $113 million from the hedge fund to pay his personal taxes. In 2013, Mr. Falcone reached a settlement with the S.E.C. that bars him from working in the securities business until 2018. He and his hedge fund agreed to pay $18 million in restitution and penalties. Today, Mr. Falcone, 54, is trying to reinvent himself by running a small publicly traded company called HC2 Holdings. The company has a market capitalization of $250 million, is based in Manhattan and invests in construction, energy and underwater engineering.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/business/dealbook/harbert-management-harbinger-capital-falcone.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T18:46:09-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Harbert Management to Pay New York $40 Million in Tax Settlement", "created_date": "2017-04-18T18:46:09-04:00", "section": "Business Day"}
