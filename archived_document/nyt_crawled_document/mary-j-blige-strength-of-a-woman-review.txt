Blige, moves like a forest fire: ruthless, wide-ranging, blunt. The heat emanating off it is palpable. Ms. Blige has been scorned, is aggrieved and is dead-set on payback. No sensible person would want to be on the receiving end of this record. There is one disarmingly sweet moment, though. On \u201cSet Me Free,\u201d Ms. Blige delivers some stern talk to the person responsible: \u201cTell me how you figure/That you made me and you gave me what I had before I met ya/And gonna have it when you\u2019re gone.\u201d It\u2019s a lecture that goes from rage to finger-wagging and back. And then she pauses, and sings, in a deliciously high and sugary voice, \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for youuuuuuuu.\u201d She sounds ecstatic and free, certain that true joy is knowing that the ones who have wronged you are certain to suffer. This album is an unburdening, though one that\u2019s rarely enacted with such glee. Ms. Blige recently split from Kendu Isaacs, her longtime husband and manager, and has been sharing details in the media. It is an unfortunate and messy trauma. And yet. Ms. Blige is a virtuoso of suffering; few singers in recent decades have been as convincing in relating pain. And \u201cStrength of a Woman\u201d \u2014 her first album since the underappreciated \u201cLondon Sessions,\u201d in 2014 \u2014 is her most affecting and wounded album in several years. \u201cShould I stick it out? Are you worth this fight?\u201d she muses on \u201cThick of It,\u201d though judging by the tone of her singing, those are questions that already have answers. At some moments on this album, she\u2019s lost in a reverie of frustration and anger, her verses giving up structure in exchange for loose but pointed exhaustion. On \u201cThank You,\u201d she turns heartbreak into blessing: \u201cThank you for showing me who you really you are/\u2019Cause up \u2019til now I wouldn\u2019t believe you would go this far.\u201d That the music accompanying these realizations rarely reaches their same intensity level is a liability, but a small one. It\u2019s also not directional in the slightest, even the songs that feature Kanye West (\u201cLove Yourself\u201d) or Missy Elliott, DJ Khaled and Quavo (\u201cGlow Up\u201d). The music isn\u2019t immaterial \u2014 rather, its relative calm (apart from the disco number \u201cFind the Love\u201d) is a reminder to focus on the texture of Ms. Blige\u2019s pain. She can tell stories that instruments just can\u2019t. Around midway through the album, the tone begins to shift from vengeful to empowering. She shifts from rebuke to righteousness (\u201cHow could you believe that I wouldn\u2019t fight back?\u201d she sings on \u201cTelling the Truth\u201d) and begins to use her story as a teaching tool. \u201cYou gotta love like you\u2019ve never been hurt/To find a love that you deserve,\u201d she implores on \u201cIndestructible.\u201d She could be issuing a warning to her listeners to examine the seemingly intractable pain in their lives, or she could be looking in the mirror.", "title": "For Mary J.
