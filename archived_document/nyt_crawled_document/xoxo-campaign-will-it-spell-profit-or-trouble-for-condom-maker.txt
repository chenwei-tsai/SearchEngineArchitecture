When a company discovered that women accounted for less than one-third of the purchases of its products, it shifted direction to appeal more directly to them. But when the company is the largest condom seller in America, at a time of heightened divisiveness regarding reproductive rights and women\u2019s health, the situation can get a little more complicated. That is not stopping Church & Dwight Company, the makers of Trojan condoms, from unveiling a campaign on Monday that it considers the most ambitious in the brand\u2019s history. It includes 30-second commercials that will air during prime time on CBS and NBC \u2014 a first for Trojan \u2014 as well as on networks like MTV, VH1, Bravo and Comedy Central. In early June, Trojan will be featured at the top of YouTube for 24 hours. The campaign introduces a new product, XOXO, that is basically a typical condom. But it comes in more gender-neutral purple packaging and includes a carrying case that could slip easily (and discreetly) into a purse. The marketing for XOXO is also intended to convey a sense of shared responsibility when it comes to safe sex. The ads, made by the Joey Company, feature couples kissing intimately on doorsteps and a pier, along with a female voice-over. But it is a perilous time for brands, in which social media outrage can be prompted with one misstep. Witness the recent vociferous criticism aimed at Pepsi after it released an ad that invoked the Black Lives Matter movement. Similarly, after the Women\u2019s March, and political debates over funding for organizations like Planned Parenthood, Trojan is trying out its new campaign in a potentially unforgiving environment. Could some see it as suggesting that it is a woman\u2019s responsibility to ensure that she and her partner practice safe sex? Bruce Weiss, the brand\u2019s vice president of marketing, said he was not overly concerned about people misinterpreting Trojan\u2019s message. \u201cWe consistently hear from people as they shop for condoms, especially from women, that they feel the weight of everyone\u2019s eyes on them when they purchase condoms,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cThere is a big embarrassment factor.\u201d According to a 2016 study by the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University, which was funded by Trojan, 68 percent of women disagreed that it was solely the man\u2019s responsibility to buy a condom, though only 18 percent of women claim to have purchased the condom for their most recent sexual experience. Sixty-five percent of the women surveyed said they had never bought a condom. Andrea Miller, the president of the National Institute of Reproductive Health, said the notion that women might be encouraged to buy more condoms was not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 as long as there was still an agreement between partners to engage in safe sex. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s predominantly considered a male method of contraception,\u201d Ms. Miller said, \u201cit\u2019s not surprising that it is predominantly men that are purchasing it.\u201d Naomi Wolf, an author of several books that have focused on female sexuality, said she applauded the effort as empowering for women and a welcome departure from the traditional male-oriented condom ads, which she likened to commercials for Gillette men\u2019s razors. She also noted that law enforcement officers in New York State could use possession of a condom as evidence of prostitution. \u201cIt wonderfully addresses women as adults who can take responsibility, not victims of whatever the guy happens to have in his pocket or not,\u201d Ms. Wolf said. \u201cIt addresses women as adults who are thinking about their sexual health.\u201d But others wonder if Trojan, which is placing advertisements in female-oriented magazines like Glamour and Cosmopolitan, is reinforcing a notion that women should bear even more responsibility for providing their partners safe sex. Heidi Sieck, the founder of Vote Pro Choice, a political action platform, said the timing of Trojan\u2019s campaign could come off as insensitive within the current political climate. \u201cAt a time when repressive legislation restricting our reproductive rights and choices are at an all-time high, Trojan asks women to take responsibility for birth control and S.T.D. protection for their partners,\u201d Ms. Sieck wrote in an email. \u201cIf Trojan really valued women owning our sexuality and celebrating our reproductive freedoms, then highlighting the need to preserve these rights should lead any future marketing campaigns.\u201d It is not the first time Trojan has released a product with the aim of gaining more female consumers. In 2005, it introduced Elexa, a line of condoms in pastel packages that was mainly sold in the feminine hygiene aisle. It was discontinued after a few years. Mr. Weiss said that while the company was trying to reduce the condom-buying disparity between men and women, it did not want to discourage men from continuing to purchase prophylactics. \u201cWe did not want to make this pink-washed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a girl\u2019s condom.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m the guy, I bring the condom.\u2019 It\u2019s people involved together making decisions for their sexual health.\u201d If that is indeed the message that viewers take home, Ms. Miller said, she will consider Trojan\u2019s effort a success. \u201cTo the extent that this encourages women to be empowered and take the initiative to ensure or even demand that their sexual partners use condoms,\u201d Ms. Miller said, \u201cthen I think it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d"}
