{"text": "Now that we\u2019ve tackled a sparkling red, let\u2019s move on to another contentious category: sweet German rieslings. Seldom will you see a style that is so beloved by critics, sommeliers and other wine authorities, yet so ignored by the public. It\u2019s not that riesling is unpopular, though public acceptance never quite matches critical plaudits. But this particular wine, riesling with discernible sweetness, is an especially difficult sell. Partly it\u2019s the sweetness, which even in Germany is a style in decline. For English speakers, another huge obstacle may be the German language, with its syllabic pileups. Nonetheless, we\u2019re plunging in. These wines are too thrilling, too delicious and too versatile with food to allow us to be deterred by a bunch of umlauts. There\u2019s no accounting for taste, of course. But you\u2019ve got to try the wines first. And if you already think you know these wines, why not try them again? Tastes evolve. Here are the three wines I recommend: D\u00f6nnhoff Nahe Riesling Sp\u00e4tlese Oberh\u00e4user Br\u00fccke 2015 (Terry Theise Estate Selection/Skurnik Wines, New York), $43 Carl Loewen Mosel Riesling Sp\u00e4tlese Leiwen Laurentiuslay 2015 (Terry Theise Estate Selection/Skurnik Wines), $26 Joh. Jos. Pr\u00fcm Mosel Riesling Sp\u00e4tlese Bernkasteler Badstube 2015 (Rudi Wiest/Cellars International, Carlsbad, Calif.), $37 Can\u2019t find these wines, or other sp\u00e4tlese cuv\u00e9es from these producers? Don\u2019t worry. Dozens of exceptional wines are available. The key words to look for are \u201criesling sp\u00e4tlese,\u201d which indicate very ripe riesling grapes fermented to leave some discernible sweetness in the wine. Avoid any sp\u00e4tlese also labeled \u201ctrocken,\u201d which indicates a dry wine. Along with additional sp\u00e4tlese cuv\u00e9es from these winemakers, other German producers to look for include: Julian Haart, Weiser-K\u00fcnstler, Schloss Lieser, Sch\u00e4fer-Fr\u00f6hlich, A. J. Adam, Dr. Loosen, Fritz Haag, Maximin Gr\u00fcnhaus, Selbach-Oster, Alfred Merkelbach, Joh. Jos. Christoffel, Willi Schaefer and Leitz. I selected the 2015 vintage, which has received a great deal of hype, partly because it is now in the market. But if you find older vintages, do not hesitate to buy them. They may be even better. What to serve with these wines? Just about anything you like. Light seafood and poultry dishes would be fine, as would many spicy dishes. Why not test the frequently repeated notion that sp\u00e4tlese rieslings go wonderfully with Asian cuisines? Now, let me repeat the usual caution: Don\u2019t serve these wines too cold. If they are icy, the nuances will be difficult to detect. Take the bottles out of the fridge about half an hour before serving. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.
