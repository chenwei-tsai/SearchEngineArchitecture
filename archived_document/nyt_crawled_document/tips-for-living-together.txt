{"text": "Moving in with your partner before getting married is a big step legally, financially, and emotionally. Here are some compelling cohabitation tips from the experts. Don\u2019t combine finances in a permanent way. Don\u2019t co-sign for a credit card or a loan together. By law, you are not both liable just because you live together. Be vulnerable and honest when talking about money. Agree to a financial plan. Enlist the help of a financial planner if necessary. Reveal your student loan debt, credit card balances and other obligations. Create a plan to reduce these debts over time. If you open a joint account, also maintain individual accounts. Rent or mortgage, property taxes, food, pets, utilities and emergency savings may be joint expenses. Boys\u2019 or girls\u2019 nights out or student loan debt may be separate. Joint expenses can be divided equally, or in proportion to income. Informal agreements can backfire. Legal documentation is best. If buying a house, consider how you will divide mortgage, property tax, maintenance, homeowner association fees and insurance payments. Decide how, and under what conditions, the house would be sold, and if one party would have the right to buy out the other. Come up with a backup plan should one partner be unable to keep up with payments. Don\u2019t assume you\u2019re on the same page about what chores need to be done, how and how often, and who\u2019s going to do them. Consider whether you and your partner share the same standard of cleanliness. Do chores together and put on music or a podcast. Tie something positive to a chore you might not be looking forward to. Scour sites like Chairish and the marketplace section of Apartment Therapy for local, gently used pieces, and browse flea markets for inexpensive finds. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of textiles, accessories and window treatments; they can bring a space to life. Use smart storage solutions to help transform a home. Pare down possessions. Try to make sure you\u2019re not holding onto a ton of stuff that isn\u2019t meaningful to you anymore. Look at the bigger picture: Do you think this person will be a good roommate? Figure out who\u2019s going to shop, cook, clean and pay the bills, while striving to keep it as fair and balanced as possible Talk respectfully, take responsibility for yourself and try not to raise your voice. Bring grievances up in a way that\u2019s respectful. Do not blame or shame. When conflict arises, use \u201cI\u201d statements to address the disagreement. Always try to put your best foot forward. If you\u2019re going to be walking around in pajamas, at least try to make them cute pajamas. Make a series of agreements about how and when screen time is allowed. Mealtimes and the bedroom should remain technology-free to give you and your partner an opportunity to connect. Minimize \u201cdouble screen\u201d time. If you\u2019re doing something with your partner, even if it\u2019s something as mindless as watching TV, focus on that alone.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/realestate/tips-for-living-together.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Real Estate", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:39-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:22-04:00", "abstract": "Legal, financial and practical things to consider before moving in with your significant other.", "title": "Tips for Living Together Without Going Nuts"}
