The panel, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, known as Jcope, filed papers in State Supreme Court in Albany seeking to have a judge enforce the subpoena, arguing that the nonprofit had no basis for refusing to provide the documents, according to two people familiar with the matter. The Campaign for One New York now has several days to respond, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the papers were filed under seal. The group\u2019s lawyer, Laurence D. Laufer, said in a letter on Friday that the group would no longer cooperate with the panel\u2019s investigation into the nonprofit\u2019s lobbying activities, saying the inquiry had become \u201cblatantly political.\u201d At issue before the judge is whether the panel\u2019s most recent subpoena was lawful, or whether the panel sought documents in a manner that was overly broad or burdensome, or that sought information that would be considered privileged and therefore not subject to disclosure. The investigation by the panel is focused on whether the Campaign for One New York, which Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, created after his election in 2013 to carry forward his agenda, had acted as a lobbyist without filing the required paperwork declaring itself one. It had done so in 2014, when the group was advocating Mr. de Blasio\u2019s universal prekindergarten initiative, which required state approval, but did not register again as a lobbyist in 2015. The group has maintained that its activities that year \u2014 and in 2016, when the group was winding down its operations \u2014 did not include lobbying and that it was not required to file. Mr. Laufer, in the 12-page letter, argued that the investigation had gone beyond its original focus on lobbying to include fund-raising activities that were not within Jcope\u2019s jurisdiction to investigate. In the letter, Mr. Laufer suggested that the panel\u2019s investigation had been of a piece with an inquiry by the State Board of Elections into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising on behalf of Democrats in State Senate contests in 2014; both independent agencies have had ties to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, he argued, and may have been influenced by the governor, a Democrat, who has been in an open feud with Mr. de Blasio for months.", "item_type": "Article"}
