As Daniel J. Boorstin wrote in his landmark 1961 book THE IMAGE: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, fame, which had once been based largely on achievement or on high birth, was becoming more a matter of \u201ca person who is known for his well-knownness.\u201d And the Stork Club was the temple of the high priest of this new cult of fame for fame\u2019s sake, the columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell, who presided over a m\u00e9lange of stars, athletes, politicians and the merely notable from the club\u2019s Table 50. In Winchell\u2019s reporting, \u201cThe death of ten thousand people in Ethiopia was followed immediately by a Hollywood divorce or romance,\u201d Neal Gabler wrote in his brilliant 1994 biography WINCHELL: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity. \u201cDozens of these items raced past listeners each program, not only abutting one another but most given the same urgency and drama. Nothing was differentiated.\u201d Winchell\u2019s reach was enormous. One listener recalled \u201cstrolling one Sabbath evening for six blocks through a residential section of Birmingham [Alabama] and never losing a word of W.W.\u2019s broadcast as his voice came through a succession of open windows.\u201d Virtually forgotten in our own time, Winchell is an undeniable architect of the way we live now \u2014 which makes Gabler\u2019s biography essential reading. \u201cA mention in his column or on his broadcast meant one was among the exalted,\u201d Gabler wrote. \u201cIt meant that one\u2019s name was part of the general fund of knowledge. It meant that one\u2019s exploits, even if they were only the exploits of dining, rated acknowledgment. It meant that one\u2019s life was validated.\u201d Politically, Winchell, once an enthusiastic booster of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s, claimed to have introduced the New York lawyer (and later Donald Trump mentor) Roy Cohn to Senator Joseph McCarthy and the broadcaster\u2019s program became a platform for the Red-baiting of the 1950s. Culturally, Winchell helped create the ambient world of celebrity that permanently blurred the lines between politics, policy, sports and entertainment. \u201cThis culture,\u201d according to Gabler, \u201cwould bind an increasingly diverse, mobile and atomized nation until it became, in many respects, America\u2019s dominant ethos, celebrity consciousness our new common denominator.\u201d To understand the narcissism of the first decades of the 21st century, it may help to realize that it is neither a sudden nor an entirely new phenomenon. \u201cThere is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about,\u201d Oscar Wilde\u2019s Lord Henry remarked in 1890\u2019s \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d \u201cand that is not being talked about.\u201d The world Wilde anticipated and Winchell crystallized can be explained by a few key texts that illuminate how we find ourselves with a president of the United States who used to call up New York tabloid writers (and would very likely have called Winchell, had Winchell still been around) posing as Trump spokesman \u201cJohn Miller\u201d or \u201cJohn Barron\u201d to talk about \u2026 himself. Much of what Winchell wrought was described in philosophical terms by Boorstin in the oft-quoted (but less read) \u201cThe Image.\u201d Aside from his definition of fame \u2014 a similar point to Andy Warhol\u2019s better-known remark that in the future everybody would be famous for 15 minutes \u2014 Boorstin\u2019s key contribution was the notion of modern life as a series of \u201cpseudo-events.\u201d A pseudo-event, Boorstin wrote, was, first, \u201cnot spontaneous, but comes about because someone has planned, planted or incited it. Typically, it is not a train wreck or an earthquake, but an interview\u201d \u2014 or a tweet. Second, it is \u201cplanted primarily \u2026 for the immediate purpose of being reported or reproduced. Therefore, its occurrence is arranged for the convenience of the reporting or reproducing media.\u201d Public life in particular is thus not organic but manufactured and manipulated for the maximum advantage of those doing the manufacturing and the manipulating. Winchell\u2019s pal Joe McCarthy was, in Boorstin\u2019s words, \u201ca natural genius at creating reportable happenings that had an interestingly ambiguous relation to underlying reality.\u201d As Richard Rovere of The New Yorker wrote in his book about the senator\u2019s rise to power, McCarthy \u201cinvented the morning press conference called for the purpose of announcing an afternoon press conference. The reporters would come in \u2026 and McCarthy would say that he just wanted to give them the word that he expected to be ready with a shattering announcement later in the day, for use in the papers the following morning. This would gain him a headline in the afternoon papers: \u2018New McCarthy Revelations Awaited in Capital.\u2019 Afternoon would come, and if McCarthy had something, he would give it out, but often enough he had nothing, and this was a matter of slight concern. He would simply say that he wasn\u2019t quite ready, that he was having difficulty in getting some of the \u2018documents\u2019 he needed or that a \u2018witness\u2019 was proving elusive. Morning headlines: \u2018Delay Seen in New McCarthy Case \u2014 Mystery Witness Being Sought.\u2019\u201d And so McCarthy, simply by asserting things that may or may not have had any connection to reality, dominated the life of the age. For a grand but accessible view of the evolution (or, depending on your point of view, devolution) of technology and culture, Neil Postman\u2019s 1985 AMUSING OURSELVES TO DEATH: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business is indispensable. Linking our changing consciousness to fundamental shifts in the means of human communication, Postman identifies two key turning points: the move from speech to text and from text to moving images. \u201cTo engage the written word means to follow a line of thought, which requires considerable powers of classifying, inference-making and reasoning,\u201d Postman writes. \u201cIt means to uncover lies, confusions and overgeneralizations, to detect abuses of logic and common sense. It also means to weigh ideas, to compare and contrast assertions, to connect one generalization to another.\u201d The Enlightenment was made possible in large measure by the rise of mass print as the principal means of discourse, creating, according to Postman, \u201ca definition of intelligence that gave priority to the objective, rational use of the mind and at the same time encouraged forms of public discourse with serious, logically ordered content.\u201d Once the telegraph was introduced, displacing books and pamphlets, news began coming with unprecedented speed, shortening attention spans \u2014 a development that grew exponentially with television. Suddenly \u201cthe typographic mind,\u201d in Postman\u2019s formulation, was supplanted by a \u201cpeek-a-boo world\u201d of journalistic and political showmanship. More information than ever was now available to more people, but in shorter bursts that newspapers and periodicals and then radio began to use as fodder for drama rather than exposition or illumination. \u201cWe are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate,\u201d Henry David Thoreau wrote in \u201cWalden.\u201d \u201cWe are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear will be that the Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.\u201d Then the introduction of television made the telegraphic era seem quaint. The point of television, Postman argues, is to entertain, not to educate \u2014 thus, as any viewer of contemporary television news knows, the motive force of such programming, and therefore of the conduct of our minute-to-minute political life, is the classic elements of drama: conflict, novelty and clearly identifiable heroes and villains. (Or at least clearly identifiable for that segment; the imperative to keep the story moving, the perennial imperative of dramatists since the world began, means \u201cbreaking news\u201d often connotes a shift in who\u2019s the hero and who\u2019s the villain for that given moment.) Postman died before the invention of social media, but it doesn\u2019t take much to apply his arguments to the age of Trump. Twitter is a kind of 21st-century telegraph, bringing us bursts of news and opinion with little to no context, appealing to the emotions rather than to the intellect; the typographic mind requires more than 140 characters to do its work. Cable news offers us dramatic serials, entertaining in their twists and turns and outsize characters \u2014 or, to be more precise, its outsize character, the 45th president. It\u2019s Walter Winchell\u2019s world.
