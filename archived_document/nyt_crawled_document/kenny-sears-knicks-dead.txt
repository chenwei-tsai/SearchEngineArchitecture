{"text": "Kenny Sears, a two-time All-Star for the Knicks who was the first basketball player to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated, in 1954, died on April 23 at his home in Watsonville, Calif. He was 83. His wife, Eunice Sears, confirmed his death. Sears, a reedy, 6-foot-9 sharpshooting forward, was picked for the cover of Sports Illustrated, then a new magazine, before he began his six full seasons with the Knicks. He was chosen because of his standout play at Santa Clara University, where he was twice named West Coast Conference player of the year. In college, he went on three impressive N.C.A.A. tournament runs with the team, reaching the Final Four in 1952 and the round of 8 in 1953 and \u201954. As a senior, he averaged 22.3 points per game and was named an all-American. The Knicks chose him as the fourth overall pick in the National Basketball Association draft in 1955. He played with the Hall of Famers Sweetwater Clifton, Harry Gallatin, Dick McGuire and Richie Guerin and the All-Stars Carl Braun and Willie Naulls, competing against N.B.A. stars like Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman. Sears led the Knicks in scoring for two seasons, averaging 18.6 points per game in 1957-58 and 21.0 in 1958-59. He was chosen as an All-Star in 1958 and 1959, and twice led the N.B.A. in field-goal percentage, shooting .490 in the 1958-59 season and .477 in the next. But the Knicks struggled during the mid- and late 1950s, and Sears\u2019s only playoff appearance with the team was in 1959, when it lost in the first round to the Syracuse Nationals. \u201cPlaying a team like Boston, who we played, like, a dozen times, we just couldn\u2019t compete with them,\u201d Sears said in an article on the Knicks\u2019 website in 2015. \u201cAnd then when Chamberlain came in the league, we were nowhere.\u201d The Knicks were 21-58 in the 1960-61 season, and Sears missed several games after breaking his jaw in a fistfight with George Lee of the Detroit Pistons. Frustrated with the team, he decided to leave for the San Francisco Saints of the American Basketball League, Abe Saperstein\u2019s newly formed competitor to the N.B.A. The Knicks sued Sears for breach of contract when he left, and he filed a countersuit against the team. The A.B.L., best known for introducing 3-point scoring for long-distance baskets, lasted only one full season. Nothing came of the lawsuits; they were dropped when Sears returned to the Knicks in 1962, before the A.B.L. went out of business. Sears played only 23 games in his second stint with the Knicks before he was traded to the Warriors, who had just moved to San Francisco from Philadelphia. He joined a talented squad built around Chamberlain, but his best playing was behind him. He retired after the Warriors reached the N.B.A. finals in 1964, losing to the Celtics in five games. \u201cThe game passed me up,\u201d he told Sports Illustrated. \u201cIt became very physical, a lot of pushing and shoving, and I didn\u2019t weigh much.\u201d In his eight-season N.B.A. career, Sears averaged 13.9 points per game with a .455 field goal percentage. He scored 7,355 points, before the N.B.A. instituted 3-point shots. Kenneth Robert Sears was born on Aug. 17, 1933, in Watsonville, near Monterey Bay, to the former Vivian Drown and Mark Sears, who worked in agriculture. He graduated from high school there before heading to Santa Clara, where he studied history. He married Eunice Schiavon in 1959. After retiring from the N.B.A., Sears owned a bar, then sold cars and later recreational vehicles. He and his wife split their time between California and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where he fished and distributed hundreds of bicycles he repaired by hand to local children. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Dante; a daughter, Debra Barry; three granddaughters; and three great-grandsons. Sears wrote in The New York Journal in 1957 that he had been very self-conscious about his height as a child \u2014 so shy that he went on only one date in high school. \u201cBasketball was my only emotional outlet,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt dragged me out of the dark corners where I\u2019d hidden to avoid stares.\u201d He added: \u201cDuring the glamorous nights of school proms and balls, I stayed at home and read. But I was lonely, and doctors tell me now that at that point I was dangerously close to a breakdown.\u201d He finally felt accepted in 1955, he wrote, when he received a congratulatory telegram after a stellar performance in an A.A.U. basketball game after his college season had ended. The telegram had been signed by nearly the entire town of Watsonville, and it was exactly 6 feet 9 inches long.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/sports/basketball/kenny-sears-knicks-dead.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T16:39:55-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "created_date": "2017-05-02T16:39:55-04:00", "abstract": "Sears, a 6-foot-9 forward who was with the Knicks for six full seasons, starting in 1955, was the first basketball player to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated.", "title": "Kenny Sears, Knicks\u2019 Two-Time Leading Scorer, Is Dead at 83"}
