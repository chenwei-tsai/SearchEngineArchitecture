{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The debate within the Trump administration over what to do about the Paris climate agreement has reached a critical phase, according to people familiar with the internal negotiations. The decision could hinge on the interpretation of a single phrase in a single provision of a document that took years to write. The question is whether to walk away from the agreement sealed by the Obama administration and nearly 200 other nations at the end of 2015 \u2014 as Donald J. Trump promised as a presidential candidate to do \u2014 or to weaken the nation\u2019s commitment under the deal to reducing greenhouse gases while remaining in the accord. The provision at issue, Article 4.11, states that a nation \u201cmay at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition.\u201d The question is whether the ability to \u201cadjust\u201d is like a ratchet, allowing progress only in one direction \u2014 upward \u2014 or if it permits a country to weaken its commitment without violating the terms of the complex deal. The fight within the White House over what to do about the Paris deal has been going on for months. One side, led by the president\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has argued that the language of the provision does not allow nations to weaken their commitments. They urge the president to withdraw entirely from the Paris deal. Another faction, which includes the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and colleagues, believes that the agreement does allow downward adjustments to nations\u2019 goals and targets, and that the administration should modify the commitment instead of walking away. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, too, has called for the administration to \u201crenegotiate\u201d the climate pact without withdrawing from it. If Mr. Bannon\u2019s side of the debate wins the contest for Mr. Trump\u2019s approval, the announcement of a decision to withdraw from the climate deal could come as early as next week. The two sides clashed over the issue in a meeting on Thursday, when the White House Counsel\u2019s Office surprised Ms. Trump by suggesting that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s faction might have the law on its side, Politico reported. The conflict led to an unusual meeting on Monday involving lawyers from several government agencies, reportedly including the White House, the Justice Department and the State Department. Among the hard-line opponents of action against climate change both inside and outside the White House, the strong resistance to the notion that the Paris agreement includes downward flexibility is accompanied by warnings that efforts to relax commitments will lead to burdensome lawsuits from activists. Christopher C. Horner, a senior legal fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, said liberal state attorneys general and climate activists would inevitably sue over efforts to weaken the targets. \u201cThis will be most aggressive in the Ninth Circuit, which hopefully triggers some memories in the minds of administration lawyers,\u201d he said, referring to the fight over the administration\u2019s immigration plan, which has been stayed by the California-based federal appeals court. \u201cDespite the mad rush to insist that plain language means either the opposite of what it says, or else nothing at all, under any canon of construction, Article 4 does not permit revisions downward,\u201d Mr. Horner said. \u201cThe language is deliberate and reads only one way: the way it was written and, as the context affirms, was plainly intended.\u201d The officials aligned with Ms. Trump and Mr. Tillerson, however, have suggested privately that the legal theory of a strictly binding agreement is little more than a ploy to force the administration to pull out of the deal. Todd D. Stern, the lead climate negotiator in the Obama administration and an expert on the deal, said negotiators wrote the flexibility to reduce targets into the agreement by careful design. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018Boy, nobody thought of that,\u2019\u201d he said. The issue was discussed intensely in Paris, he explained. \u201cThere were countries that wanted to say, \u2018Thou shalt not, you are precluded from adjusting now.\u2019 We did not want to do that,\u201d he said. Downward adjustment had already occurred with climate commitments. Japan, after losing nuclear power facilities in the Fukushima disaster, had to adjust its targets downward. The United States had feared that without the ability to adjust targets, countries would lowball their commitments, Mr. Stern said. \u201cWe had a strong view, and we prevailed on this,\u201d he added. Still, he said any downward adjustment would be a \u201cserious mistake\u201d that would have grave consequences for the country: \u201cI think it would produce broad collateral damage for the U.S. internationally.\u201d The question of whether the administration will leave the climate agreement has drawn broad opposition from the nation\u2019s trading partners and businesses, and even from fossil fuel companies. In a recent letter to administration officials, Exxon Mobil called the agreement \u201can effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change.\u201d At the coal company Cloud Peak Energy, a spokesman, Rick Curtsinger, said, \u201cWe do believe that it needs to be amended, but think that it\u2019s important to stay at the negotiating table.\u201d Colin Marshall, the company\u2019s chief executive, sent a letter to Mr. Trump on April 6 urging him to remain in the Paris agreement, \u201calbeit with a much different pledge on emissions,\u201d and to promote technologies that can reduce the greenhouse gases produced by the use of coal. Other nations have urged the United States to remain at the Paris table, including Britain, Canada and Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said his country will stay in the deal even if the United States withdraws. Maros Sefcovic, a vice president of the European Commission, has urged American officials to stick with the agreement, but has also said that if not, \u201cwe are ready to continue to provide the leadership on climate change.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/climate/trump-paris-climate-accord.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Climate", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T18:39:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T18:39:16-04:00", "abstract": "The Trump administration is split on whether the phrase allows a country to back away from its emissions pledges, as the president has pledged to do.", "title": "Debate Over Paris Climate Deal Could Turn on a Single Phrase"}
