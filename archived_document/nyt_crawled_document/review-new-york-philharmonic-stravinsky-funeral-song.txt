{"text": "Stravinsky\u2019s long-lost \u201cFuneral Song,\u201d which he wrote as a 26-year-old in 1908 in memory of his teacher, Rimsky-Korsakov, was rediscovered just two years ago by Russian musicologists. Since its \u201cpremiere\u201d in December, it has been making the rounds of world orchestras and arrived at the New York Philharmonic on Thursday. The piece begins with a low chromatic rumble that inches up and down methodically, like earthworms readying the soil for a new grave. Those rumblings were answered by ghostly high winds, then a muted trumpet issuing a desolate call. Eventually a pulse asserts itself, and the music assumes a heavy, forward-schlepping motion. Over the course of the 12-minute work, there are radiant brass chorales, luscious strings and a consoling melody intoned by single oboe, then a flute. But at every turn, the earthworm motif awaits, tunneling its way through sections of the orchestra. So the music sounds very much as you\u2019d expect a \u201cFuneral Song\u201d written in the early 1900s to sound. And yet listening to this evocative and emotionally open work is startling when you keep in mind where Stravinsky was headed. Two years later, he would have his breakthrough with the darkly erotic \u201cFirebird\u201d; his rule-breaking \u201cRite of Spring\u201d would explode on the scene in 1913. In the decades that followed, he would change tack repeatedly, but the common thread would be the abstraction of form and the reining in of emotions through irony. Stravinsky\u2019s work opened a smartly conceived concert at David Geffen Hall, conducted with characteristic elegance and verve by Esa-Pekka Salonen. \u201cFuneral Song\u201d was followed by the American premiere of \u201cForest,\u201d a concerto for four horns by the British composer Tansy Davies. As with the Stravinsky, this music reflected its title, though Ms. Davies\u2019s language is grounded in Modernism. Both the orchestra and the ensemble of solo horns function for the most part as groups creating composite gestures. The orchestral writing is reminiscent of that of Peter Eotvos, an alluringly blended sound of great plasticity that appears to throb and breathe like a living organism. The solo parts were performed with assurance by four current and former principal hornists of the Philharmonia Orchestra of London, an ensemble that was among the commissioning bodies. Their lines rarely stand out clearly, but seem partly obscured by the orchestral texture, much in the way moving objects in a forest are perceived in flashes behind branches and foliage. Often the four horns build up gestures in slightly delayed sequence, allowing the instruments\u2019 attacks to glance off one another. At nearly half an hour, the single-movement work sometimes feels long, but the music maintains a poetic tension throughout. Horns, this time the New York Philharmonic\u2019s own, stole the spotlight again in the concert\u2019s concluding work, Strauss\u2019 tone poem \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra.\u201d Mr. Salonen drew a magnificent performance from the orchestra that wonderfully unified the work\u2019s extremes, from the explosive brass sunbursts of the opening to the intimate warmth of the chamber ensemble.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-stravinsky-funeral-song.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T16:02:23-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T16:02:23-04:00", "abstract": "The New York Philharmonic gave the New York \u201cpremiere\u201d of the piece, written in 1908 and long believed lost.", "title": "Review: An Old Stravinsky \u2018Funeral Song\u2019 Rumbles Anew"}
