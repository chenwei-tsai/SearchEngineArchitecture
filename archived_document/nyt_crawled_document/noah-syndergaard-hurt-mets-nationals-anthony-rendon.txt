{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Noah Syndergaard, the Mets\u2019 ace, left Sunday\u2019s game against the Washington Nationals early because of an apparent injury. He was holding his right side as he departed with one out in the second inning, after giving up five earned runs, five hits and two walks, as the Nationals built a 5-2 lead. Syndergaard\u2019s early exit was just part of a demoralizing day for the Mets. They had a chance to complete a three-game sweep of the Nationals in Washington, and instead took a 23-5 loss, surrendering 23 hits, including seven home runs. Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon went 6 for 6 with three home runs and 10 runs batted in, becoming the 13th player in major-league history to collect at least that many R.B.I.s in a game. The Mets said that Syndergaard had a \u201cpossible lat strain\u201d and that he would return to New York for a magnetic resonance imaging examination. Syndergaard had fidgeted after firing a 98-mile-per-hour fastball to Bryce Harper. He then threw a 90-m.p.h. changeup, winced, pulled off his glove and grabbed his side. Catcher Rene Rivera, Manager Terry Collins and Ray Ramirez, the team\u2019s head athletic trainer, met with Syndergaard on the mound. He left the game with Ramirez by his side, and he was replaced by Sean Gilmartin. On Thursday, Syndergaard was scratched from a start because of what the team described as tendinitis in his right biceps and soreness in his biceps and shoulder. Syndergaard has insisted that he could have pitched that day, and he declined an M.R.I. because, he said, he believed the soreness was mild and he had felt better after he took anti-inflammatory medication. \u201cI know my body best. I\u2019m pretty in tune with my body,\u201d Syndergaard said on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I refused the M.R.I., because nothing happened in there.\u201d Sandy Alderson, the Mets\u2019 general manager, said on Saturday that it was uncommon for a player to decline an M.R.I. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tie him down and throw him in the tube, either,\u201d Alderson said. The Mets cleared Syndergaard to start on Sunday after he successfully threw a bullpen session on Friday. The five earned runs Syndergaard allowed to the Nationals, all in the first inning, matched the combined total for his four previous starts this season. Now the Mets \u2014 who are already without such key players as Yoenis Cespedes, Lucas Duda, Wilmer Flores, Steven Matz, Seth Lugo and David Wright \u2014 will await the prognosis for their best pitcher.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/sports/baseball/noah-syndergaard-hurt-mets-nationals-anthony-rendon.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T17:42:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T15:56:52-04:00", "abstract": "Syndergaard was holding his right side as he left with one out in the second inning after giving up five earned runs.
