{"text": "The New York Times theater editor Scott Heller checked in with the co-chief theater critics Ben Brantley and Jesse Green on Tuesday, soon after the Tony Award nominations were announced. Jesse was at home, working on his first reviews to appear in The Times, coming Friday; Ben was in London, reporting on shows in the West End. Here\u2019s their early reaction to the announcements.  Good morning, Jesse in New York, and good morning Ben, in London. Ben, do the Tony nominations make news in London? JESSE GREEN Why didn\u2019t you ask me if they make news in Brooklyn? You got me. Did they? GREEN The feed was delayed but they are now celebrating at Junior\u2019s. BEN BRANTLEY As might have been predicted, angry crowds have already gathered in Trafalgar Square, to protest the snubbing of \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,\u201d further straining already frayed Anglo-American relations. Actually, I imagine Champagne corks are popping at the Old Vic for the strong showing by \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d which originated here. GREEN \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d received seven nominations; \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d received zero. About right, by me. BRANTLEY Agreed. And the view from abroad is a heartening one, to my eyes, at least. What a great (American) roster of new plays, for a change. GREEN Yes, the nominees for Best Play, which means best new play, are \u201cSweat,\u201d \u201cOslo,\u201d \u201cIndecent\u201d and \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d all of which are important, challenging works. I would like to have seen \u201cHeisenberg\u201d on the list somehow, too, but it opened and closed very early in the season. BRANTLEY We are of one mind on that. I loved \u201cHeisenberg,\u201d though I suppose a two-hander of many months ago kind of recedes in the distance. The Tonys are notorious for out-of-sight, out-of-mind omissions. (Remember when they shut out Ian Rickson\u2019s \u201cThe Seagull,\u201d with Carey Mulligan and Kristin Scott-Thomas?) Do you think there\u2019s a clear favorite? GREEN \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2\u201d got the most favorable reviews across the board, but it may be seen as the connoisseur\u2019s choice. And the larger body of Tony voters are not necessarily connoisseurs, they\u2019re business people. They may go for \u201cSweat\u201d or \u201cOslo.\u201d \u201cSweat\u201d did win the Pulitzer recently \u2014 I served on the drama panel that nominated it. BRANTLEY I\u2019d be happy if either \u201cDoll\u2019s House\u201d or \u201cOslo\u201d won. \u201cDoll\u2019s House\u201d is more adventurous, but the scale of \u201cOslo\u201d is impressive, as is its ability to disseminate such intricate details of foreign policy without turning snoozy. GREEN \u201cOslo\u201d is also, all things considered, a feel-good show, even if history has disproved its optimism. And it is an open run. \u201cDoll\u2019s House\u201d will close in July. Voters often prefer the going concern. The April rush to the Tonys deadline was especially intense this year and I\u2019m sure both of you were bleary-eyed at the end (as were the Tony nominators). \u201cDoll\u2019s House\u201d was the last show to open and got a lot of love. Did its arrival after a bunch of musicals help its cause? BRANTLEY Well, I think it had the advantage of serving as a genuine stimulant after a couple of sleeping-pill shows (no names, \u201cAnastasia\u201d and \u201cCharlie\u201d). And what an upper to end on. Also, how great to see Laurie Metcalf in a part she can run (and I hope win) with. Let\u2019s talk musicals. Are there any sure things? GREEN There are many sure things, or if not sure then sure enough. \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d which received nine nominations, will likely win two of the biggest: Best Musical and Leading Actor for Ben Platt. \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d which received 10, will very likely win Best Musical Revival and Leading Actress for Bette Midler. This even though \u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812\u201d got more nominations than either, with 12. BRANTLEY Two months ago, I would have said \u201cEvan Hansen\u201d had a lock. But there\u2019s a lot of sentimental (and political) steam around \u201cCome From Away.\u201d And Andy Karl, valiant trouper in a knee brace that he is, may get a lot of come-from-behind love. \u201cDolly\u201d and the woman playing her are worth betting the farm (or the Harmonia Gardens) on. GREEN Sentimental is right, regarding \u201cCome From Away,\u201d but you and I disagreed strongly about that show. I felt that it was little more than an evening of Canadian civic boosterism. I would be disappointed if it prevailed over a truly complicated \u2014 morally complicated, I mean \u2014 piece like \u201cEvan Hansen.\u201d But stranger things have happened. BRANTLEY Indeed. I\u2019m not stumping for \u201cCome From Away.\u201d But I am kind of stunned by the word of mouth it\u2019s generated. We disagreed on it less strongly than you think, I suspect, though I thought for a work of efficient sentimental manipulation, it delivered. The last two Tony-winning musicals were \u201cFun Home\u201d and \u201cHamilton,\u201d both universally admired and seen as important advances for the art form. Does this year\u2019s roster of musical nominees point toward the future? BRANTLEY In a word, no. What I think is encouraging is the \u2014 you should pardon the catchword \u2014 diversity of what\u2019s on offer. And by that I don\u2019t mean just politically, but in terms of the different languages each of the nominees for Best Musical and Best Play speak. GREEN And let\u2019s face it, it was \u2014 with 1.5 exceptions \u2014 not a good year for new musicals in the first place. The roster can\u2019t be better than its individual components. BRANTLEY Which I\u2019d say is a good thing. Remember when \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d (to cite a personal favorite of yours, Jesse) stood alone? GREEN And I should add that even if I didn\u2019t like a lot of the new musicals much more than I liked \u201cSunset Boulevard,\u201d there was much to admire within them, whether performances, or songwriting or design. \u201cGreat Comet\u201d swept the design categories, deservedly. But I was sorry to find the score of \u201cWar Paint\u201d skunked. Whatever else that show may be, it\u2019s an example of classic theater songwriting. BRANTLEY I would have had it nominated for \u201cPink\u201d alone (That\u2019s Christine Ebersole\u2019s great solo at the end.) Two final questions. Any performer you felt was unfairly overlooked? And Jesse \u2014 what is a .5 good show? GREEN The nominating committee made good work of a difficult job. That said, I would like to have seen Mary-Louise Parker (for \u201cHeisenberg\u201d) and ... BRANTLEY You plucked the name out of my mouth, Jesse. GREEN \u2026 and Allison Janney (for \u201cSix Degrees of Separation\u201d) and Anthony Azizi (for \u201cOslo\u201d) and more of the great ensemble cast of \u201cJitney\u201d nominated. BRANTLEY But what do you do when a cast is as uniformly strong as that of \u201cJitney\u201d? This is when you wish there were a Best Ensemble category. GREEN Exactly. As for \u201ca .5 good show,\u201d well, that\u2019s really .25 times two: \u201cGreat Comet\u201d and \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d Your mileage may (and does) vary. BRANTLEY Ah, I\u2019d give \u201cGreat Comet\u201d a larger percentage. \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d too, though I agree that \u201cEvan Hansen\u201d is the smoothest ride.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/theater/nominations-hello-dolly-dear-evan-hansen-tony-awards.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T11:32:18-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T11:32:18-04:00", "abstract": "The co-chief theater critics Ben Brantley and Jesse Green, on the nominated plays, musicals and actors.", "title": "2017 Tony Awards: Our Theater Critics Discuss the Nominations"}
