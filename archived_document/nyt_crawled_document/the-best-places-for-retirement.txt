Alabama may be one of the cheapest places to live, but the quality of health care there leaves a lot to be desired. And while Minnesota may offer the best health care \u2014 and a quality of life second only to that in New York \u2014 it is also very expensive. These are among the findings of a recent study by the financial website WalletHub, which ranked the 50 states and the District of Columbia in three categories: affordability, health care and general quality of life.

Here are the five that ranked best \u2014 and the five that ranked the worst.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/realestate/the-best-places-for-retirement.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Real Estate", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T12:18:59-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T12:16:53-04:00", "abstract": "The best and worst states for retirees, based on affordability, health care and quality of life.", "title": "The Best and Worst Places for Retirement"}
