Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Georgia race heads to a runoff. In a special congressional election seen as an early referendum on President Trump, a Democrat narrowly missed winning a heavily conservative House district outright. Jon Ossoff came up short of the 50 percent threshold needed to win the seat, which is in the suburbs of Atlanta, and will face Karen Handel, the top Republican vote-getter, in a June runoff. He might find a head-to-head race tougher than the 18-person field this time around. Four Times journalists stayed up late to watch the election returns. Here\u2019s how they analyzed it live. \u2022 Where are those warships? Just over a week ago, the White House said that moving an aircraft carrier and three other ships to the Sea of Japan would deter North Korean aggression. \u201cWe\u2019re sending an armada,\u201d President Trump said. The problem? The ships were headed in the opposite direction. \u2022 A globalist in the White House.

Pedro Hernandez, who told the police in 2012 that he had killed Etan Patz as the boy headed to school in Manhattan in 1979, was sentenced on Tuesday. \u2022 Hunt for Facebook killer is over. Two days after a killing was recorded on video and posted online, the gunman was recognized at a fast-food restaurant in Pennsylvania on Tuesday and chased by officers. He committed suicide. \u2022 \u201cThe Daily,\u201d your audio news report. Twenty minutes a day, five days a week, hosted by Michael Barbaro and powered by New York Times journalism. Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. \u2022 President Trump has signed an order that he said would favor American companies for federal contracts and lead to changes in visa programs for foreign workers. One of our reporters explains how the order, which brings no immediate changes, is likely to affect the H-1B program that tech companies depend on. \u2022 A decision on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s future at Fox News could come in the next few days. The Murdoch family, which controls the company, has stood by Mr. O\u2019Reilly, the top-rated cable news host, who faces accusations of harassment. But their support was showing signs of erosion on Tuesday. \u2022 Big global companies used to be enthusiastic about doing business in China.

A horse can often go where vehicles can\u2019t. That\u2019s what one of our reporters and a photographer learned as they traveled along the Rio Grande with agents working to stop illegal immigration. \u2022 Life lessons from a wild and crazy guy. We sat down with the comedian Steve Martin, who took a rare dive into his stand-up career to reflect on what he\u2019s learned. When the New England Patriots visit the White House today to celebrate their Super Bowl victory, several players will be missing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\u201d said LeGarrette Blount.
