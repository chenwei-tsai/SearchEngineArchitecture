{"text": "When the Giants selected quarterback Ryan Nassib of Syracuse in the fourth round of the N.F.L. draft in 2013, General Manager Jerry Reese said he hoped that Nassib would never play. As grim as that must have been for Nassib to hear, it was Reese\u2019s way of emphasizing how much the Giants\u2019 fortunes depended on Eli Manning, their franchise quarterback. Nassib threw only 10 passes in four years and was not retained this off-season. Expectations were vastly different after the Giants chose Davis Webb in the third round of the draft on Friday night. Reese portrayed Webb, the 87th pick over all, as having the skills to ultimately succeed Manning, who turned 36 in January. \u201cEli has however much time he has left, two or three years left on his contract or however long he plays,\u201d Reese said. \u201cWe think this guy has a high ceiling that can come in here and compete and create competition at the quarterback position.\u201d (Manning has three years remaining on his contract.) Webb (6-foot-5, 230 pounds) combines size with what Reese said was the strongest arm in the draft. He completed 61.5 percent of his passes (841 of 1,367) for 9,852 yards, with 83 touchdowns and 34 interceptions, in his 35-game college career. Webb played three seasons with Texas Tech but ultimately lost his starting job to Patrick Mahomes, who was taken by Kansas City on Thursday with the 10th overall pick in the draft. Webb played last season for California as a graduate transfer. Operating out of Cal\u2019s spread offense, he compiled video game-like statistics: 4,295 passing yards on 382 completions out of 620 attempts, with 37 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Webb\u2019s apprenticeship behind Manning will most likely be compared to the early years of Aaron Rodgers, another California quarterback, with the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers, the 24th overall pick in 2005, played very little for his first three seasons, backing up Brett Favre, and then carved out a career as one of the N.F.L.\u2019s premier quarterbacks. \u201cIt\u2019s a different game and it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Giants Coach Ben McAdoo said of the transition to the N.F.L. \u201cIt\u2019s a benefit to be able to sit behind especially a veteran quarterback and learn. It goes a long way.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/sports/football/ny-giants-nfl-draft-quarterback.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T13:29:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T13:29:24-04:00", "abstract": "Davis Webb of California can expect to sit behind Eli Manning for three years, but General Manager Jerry Reese says the third-round pick \u201chas a high ceiling.\u201d", "title": "Giants Look to 2020 and Beyond in Drafting a Quarterback"}
