{"text": "Dear Diary: It was the night of April Fools\u2019 Day in 2006. I was 23 and nursing a drink at a bar on Ludlow Street. After commuting from my parents\u2019 house for a year, I had finally moved to New York City. It was a playground of cool people and things and culture, and I was awkwardly trying to find my place in it all. \u201cDo you want to try some fancy mixed nuts?\u201d a guy asked, handing me a can. I took it, skeptically, and twisted the top open. Out sprang a leopard-print \u201csnake.\u201d \u201cApril Fools!\u201d he said. It was the kind of gag gift you would find next to whoopee cushions and Precious Moments figurines at a Long Island card store, not at a cool bar on the Lower East Side. The prankster may have sensed that the snake-in-a-can was my spirit animal. He gave it to me as he left the bar. I used the gag as an icebreaker for the rest of the night. Most of the conversations were one-sided, but I didn\u2019t care. \u201cDo you want to try some fancy mixed nuts? \u2026 No? O.K.!\u201d At one point, I walked up to the biggest hipster in the place with my newfound confidence. He was tall, dressed in black and sitting in the corner. Then I recognized him: the musician Jack White. I was about to target the epitome of 2006 New York cool with the corniest April Fools\u2019 Day gag ever. \u201cDo you want to try some fancy mixed nuts?\u201d I asked. He looked at me from under his wide-brimmed hat. \u201cI\u2019ve fallen for that one before,\u201d he said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/nyregion/metropolitan-diary-april-fools-with-the-epitome-of-cool.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:05-04:00", "abstract": "Targeting a hipster icon with a corny prank.", "title": "April Fools\u2019 With the Epitome of Cool"}
