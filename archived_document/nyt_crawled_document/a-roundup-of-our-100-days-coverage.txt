{"text": "Times reporters are taking a look back at the beginning of the Trump presidency \u2014 from the biggest news stories to the most provocative tweets. Below is a roundup of this coverage (which you can also find here). Covering the Trump White House can be exhilarating, maddening, exhausting \u2014 but never boring. The New York Times\u2019s White House correspondents \u2014 Mark Landler, Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Glenn Thrush, Maggie Haberman, Michael D. Shear and Peter Baker \u2014 recall vivid moments from their first 100 days on the beat. This 2-minute video is a whirlwind tour of the triumphs and setbacks that took place during the first 100 days of President Trump\u2019s administration. Here\u2019s a look back at headlines from the print front page of The Times that covered the first 100 days of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, as well as a look at what former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush were going through at the same point in their first terms. Cataloging every tweet by Mr. Trump since he took office, we broke them down into 10 themes, from \u201cUndermining Obama\u201d to \u201cMaking America Great Again.\u201d (An analysis from Twitter confirms that Mr. Trump tweeted a lot.) No regrets, frustrated, inspired, somewhere in between: Voters who talked with Times reporters around the start of the Trump presidency describe how they feel now. Congress has had one of the least productive opening acts in recent memory. Partisanship and a chaotic White House have combined to undermine the opportunity for Republicans to enact the legislation they have long desired. On Thursday, Mr. Trump gave an interview to Reuters. \u201cI thought it would be easier,\u201d he said, about being president. David Leonhardt\u2019s reading of Mr. Trump\u2019s start: His supporters deserve to be disappointed, and his opponents should be cheered by how unsuccessful his agenda has been. Ross Douthat says: It could be worse. \u201cLet me count the ways.\u201d Test your memory: Gail Collins offers a 100-Day Quiz in two parts, here and here.
