{"text": "Here\u2019s some good news for self-conscious people. That coffee stain on your shirt, those mismatched earrings you absent-mindedly selected this morning, that unfortunate haircut you just got \u2014 people do not notice those things as much as you think. Although it can feel as if your flaws and missteps are the focus of everyone\u2019s attention, research in social psychology suggests otherwise. In a classic study from the 1990s, for example, participants put on a shirt emblazoned with the face of the singer Barry Manilow and then walked into a room full of people. Later, when asked how many people in the room would be able to identify what was on their shirt, the participants significantly overestimated: It turned out that only half the number of people noticed as they had thought. Now here\u2019s the bad news. Most of the time, when you\u2019re minding your own business and feeling relatively inconspicuous, you\u2019re being watched much more than you realize. My colleagues and I demonstrated this in several studies whose findings we published in this month\u2019s issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. In one experiment, we asked two strangers participating in our study to arrive in our lab at the same time. They were seated in a waiting room and told that the experimenter was running a little behind schedule. They were invited to pass the time by reading one of the newspapers provided (or in any way they liked) as they waited for the study to begin. Five minutes later, the experimenter returned, told the participants she was ready to begin and ushered them into separate rooms in a different part of the lab. Unbeknown to the participants, the study had begun the moment they walked into the waiting room. The real reason they were made to wait was to give them an opportunity to watch \u2014 and to feel observed or unobserved by \u2014 each other. Once the participants were in their private rooms, one of them was asked to write down anything he or she noticed or thought about the other person, and then to report on a numerical scale how much he or she had observed the other person. The other participant was asked to write down anything he or she believed the other person had noticed or thought about him or her, and then to estimate how much the other person had observed him or her, using the same scale. Although people surreptitiously noticed all kinds of details about each other \u2014 clothing, personality, mood \u2014 we found that people were convinced that the other person wasn\u2019t watching them much, if at all. So other people notice our coffee stains less than we think, but they watch us in general more than we think. The problem, in both cases, is that we project the focus of our attention onto others. Because we\u2019re fixated on our coffee stain (or whatever we happen to be self-conscious about), we assume others must be, too. But when nothing in particular draws our attention to ourselves, we neglect the fact that we may nevertheless be an object of other people\u2019s interest. In short, we pay too much attention to what we\u2019re paying attention to. Assuming other people are focused on the same thing we are is at the root of many kinds of miscommunication. Employees pull their hair out in frustration while bosses obliviously believe their instructions are simple and straightforward. Spouses feel misunderstood because their partners fail to notice that they cleaned the house. Activists preoccupied with the issue of health care assume others are uncaring because they can\u2019t recall what a single-payer system is. We all have a tendency to egocentrically ascribe our own perspective to others. That doesn\u2019t make us selfish or bad. But it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that everyone\u2019s attention illuminates the world in a particular way, and what gets spotlighted differs from person to person.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/opinion/sunday/youre-too-focused-on-what-youre-focused-on.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T14:33:19-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-04-29T14:33:19-04:00", "abstract": "Everyone else is paying attention to other stuff.", "title": "You\u2019re Too Focused on What You\u2019re Focused On"}
