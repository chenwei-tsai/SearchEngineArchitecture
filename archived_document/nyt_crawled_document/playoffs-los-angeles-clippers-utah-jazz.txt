{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The Los Angeles Clippers have maintained a holding pattern, both satisfying and distressing, over the last six seasons. They have reached the playoffs each year, a streak that ranks fourth in the N.B.A., yet they have not gone beyond the second round despite an enviable roster sprinkled with All-Stars present and past. A 104-91 loss at home on Sunday, in Game 7 of their first-round series with the Utah Jazz, kept that pattern intact, while also foreshadowing extensive disruption for the franchise. A convergence of contractual developments and creeping age could break up the band. Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, the team\u2019s headliners, can opt out of their deals over the summer, and J. J. Redick will qualify for free agency. A majority of the Clippers are in their 30s; four more are 28 or 29. Paul Pierce, 39, intends to retire. The only real mystery is the degree to which the team will be made over. A lot depends on how much the Clippers have tested the patience of their expressive owner Steve Ballmer, who paid $2 billion, an N.B.A. record, for the franchise in 2014. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the loss today instead of the summer,\u201d Coach Doc Rivers said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone will have their own suggestions. We\u2019ve been reading our obituary for about three months now.\u201d The Clippers\u2019 matchup with the Jazz was the only series to go the maximum seven games in an otherwise suspense-free first round of the playoffs. That these teams went the distance, however, was hardly surprising: They entered with identical records and an even split in their regular-season matchups. The widest margin of victory in the first six games of this playoff series was 8 points, and the visiting team won four of those games. Home teams have historically won 80 percent of Game 7s in the N.B.A., but the Clippers had to withstand the absence of a cornerstone player. Griffin took permanent leave from the postseason after he sustained a toe injury in Game 3. \u201cNot having Blake obviously is a major wound,\u201d Rivers said, before adding: \u201cGive Utah credit. There\u2019s no excuses. We lost.\u201d For their part, the Jazz endured the comings and goings of their dynamic pivotman, Rudy Gobert, who had been shelved with leg and ankle injuries sustained in separate games. On Sunday, fouls \u2014 two were whistled against Gobert in the opening three minutes \u2014 drove him to the bench. But his understudy, Derrick Favors, kept the Jazz from losing ground by delivering three baskets without a miss, five rebounds and two assists through the remainder of the quarter. Two minutes had not expired in the second period before Gobert hacked another Clipper and was removed. On came Favors, who continued apace, padding his statistics by halftime to nearly double-double status. The Clippers, troubled by turnovers, drifted behind by 11 points but closed the deficit to 7 at the break. After Gobert\u2019s fourth foul early in the third quarter, two baskets by Favors came amid a Jazz burst that put them in front by 21. Gobert fouled out with a single point, but Favors compensated with 17, matching George Hill as Utah\u2019s scoring runner-up, behind Gordon Hayward, who had 26. Rivers had reiterated before tipoff that no player can match the competitiveness of Paul, who had 13 points and 9 assists on Sunday, but Paul wore down while failing to lift teammates to his level. The exceptions were center DeAndre Jordan (24 points, 16 rebounds) and the reserve Jordan Crawford, who caught fire late to amass 20 points. While Paul is expected to remain a Clipper, Redick may have worn out his welcome with a 3-point outing. The Jazz will meet the Golden State Warriors in the next round.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/sports/basketball/playoffs-los-angeles-clippers-utah-jazz.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T20:54:25-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T20:54:25-04:00", "abstract": "Utah, led by Gordon Hayward\u2019s 28 points, sent Chris Paul and Los Angeles to its sixth first- or second-round exit from the playoffs in the past six seasons.", "title": "Jazz Top Clippers in Game 7 and Advance to Face Warriors"}
