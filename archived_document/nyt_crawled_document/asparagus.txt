That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. I\u2019m thinking wok-fried asparagus with walnuts and a bowl of brown rice for dinner tonight, along with fierce consideration of why it is that I don\u2019t cook like that more often: It\u2019s really good, notwithstanding the brown-rice hippie vibe. It could be a Monday tradition. Also, it\u2019s fast, and might leave me time to make Julia Moskin\u2019s recipe for the best chicken salad before bed. If so, I could have the best desk lunch of the year tomorrow, or a marvelous dinner on Tuesday night. (The salad cures up nicely in the overnight. Serve in lettuce cups just as you might at the country club, working for minimum wage.) Later this week, I\u2019d like to make Melissa Clark\u2019s new recipe for trout with chive butter, which you can dress up with trout or salmon roe, or make more simply with capers. If you have a grill outside, or a fireplace, you can make like Tamar Adler, and cook the dish in a cast-iron pan on the edge of the flames. Feel like pasta instead? We\u2019ve put together a big collection of spring pastas that you can serve in about 30 minutes. Or just like you want to cook something to recognize the new season? We\u2019ve got lots of ideas. Pick and choose. For myself, I\u2019d like to return to asparagus because that is what is done this time of year, and take down one if not all three of David Tanis\u2019s newest recipes for Cooking: for charred asparagus with a green-garlic chimichurri; for steamed asparagus with brown butter, lemon, sage and pistachios; and for shaved asparagus with ginger and sesame. Would like to, anyway. I probably can\u2019t. This is my last newsletter for the next couple of weeks. I\u2019m making like the sea shanty: bound for Australia, on assignment for The Times. (Here\u2019s the Pogues with a great version of the song.) I\u2019ll be in Melbourne and Sydney, and you\u2019ll be hearing from Melissa Clark and Kim Severson in my stead. Of course I\u2019ll tell you all about my adventures when I\u2019m back. Meanwhile, there are thousands more recipes that you might cook in coming days available on Cooking. Go browse! Then save the ones you like to your recipe box, so you can find them when you\u2019re ready to cook. And when you\u2019re done cooking? Let us know how it all turned out: Put stars on the recipes, and add notes to them if you have any. You can even trumpet about your success on social media. We follow the hashtag #NYTCooking. (You can follow me in Australia on my Twitter and Instagram feeds.) And if anything goes wrong? Hey, it happens. We\u2019re here to help: cookingcare@nytimes.com. Now, have you read Robert Hughes\u2019s \u201cThe Fatal Shore\u201d? You can guess why I\u2019m in it, probably. The book is an account of the birth of Australia, by one of the great art historians of the 20th century, a beautiful writer (and keen fisherman), who died in 2012. You might enjoy exploring this oral history of the hamburgers of the Deep South, from the Southern Foodways Alliance. And do check out this video essay at The Alaska Dispatch News, on the spring tide at Turnagain Arm, south of Anchorage. Be nice to Melissa and Kim while I\u2019m gone. Cook a lot. I\u2019ll see you in May.", "published_date": "2017-04-23T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Food", "abstract": "Wok-fried, steamed, shaved or with a green-garlic chimichurri: Make some this week.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/dining/asparagus.html", "source": "The New York Times"}
