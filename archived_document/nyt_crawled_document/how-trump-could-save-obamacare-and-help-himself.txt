{"text": "Imagine waking up to this headline: \u201cTrump Saves the Affordable Care Act.\u201d It sounds far-fetched \u2014 and would certainly be an audacious move \u2014 but President Trump could pull it off. He has already changed course when presented with new information: After all, China is no longer a \u201ccurrency manipulator,\u201d and NATO is no longer \u201cobsolete.\u201d In this case, improving the Affordable Care Act would not only be good policy for millions of Americans but would also be farsighted politics for Mr. Trump. The obvious obstacles are his repeated claim that the law is a \u201cdisaster\u201d and internal Republican Party dynamics. But his endorsement of the House Republican bill last month ended in one of the biggest embarrassments of his first 100 days. And the new attempt this week to revive the effort might have a similar fate. So he shouldn\u2019t let his past criticisms preclude him from pivoting from \u201crepeal and replace\u201d to \u201crepair and rebrand.\u201d A rebranded Affordable Care Act would be consistent with the vision Mr. Trump offered during the campaign. Then, he promised that everyone would be \u201cbeautifully covered,\u201d with \u201cmuch lower deductibles,\u201d and \u201ctaken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\u201d He said he wouldn\u2019t cut Medicaid and would provide coverage for those who can\u2019t afford care. As former White House aides who worked on the health care law, we remember why reform was desperately needed. Our system was broken, with 50 million uninsured, skyrocketing premiums and no relationship between cost and quality. That was then. Now we have the lowest percentage of uninsured Americans on record and the slowest rate of inflation in health care spending in 50 years. Medicare beneficiaries have saved $27 billion on prescription drugs, quality of care is improving, and nearly 600,000 unnecessary hospital readmissions have been prevented. Still, the law isn\u2019t perfect. Too many hardworking families struggle to pay their medical bills, deductibles are often too high, and some insurance marketplaces need more competition. The original House Republican bill would have made these problems worse. Premiums would have spiked for most families in the individual market (especially for older people), 24 million would have lost coverage, and over $800 billion would have been cut from Medicaid, a program that provides lifesaving help to severely disabled children, the frail elderly and the poor. Given this, Mr. Trump\u2019s support for the House bill was baffling. And the latest version \u2014 which tries to reflect the House Freedom Caucus principle that the federal government should have no role in health insurance \u2014 moves even farther from his campaign promises. The answer to the law\u2019s shortcomings isn\u2019t repeal. Many House Republicans are caught in a classic \u201cinside the Beltway\u201d dynamic \u2014 the more they repeat the repeal rhetoric, the more converted they become to the cause. But that self-perpetuating loop isn\u2019t the country\u2019s reality. There\u2019s still a winning hand for President Trump on health care, but it\u2019s not the one he\u2019s playing. \u201cRepair and rebrand\u201d would take advantage of Mr. Trump\u2019s background as a businessman and his interest in expanding the private sector. What the Affordable Care Act needs most is more customers \u2014 and federal officials taking actions to increase enrollment, strengthen private plans and ensure the marketplaces will function properly. With a few smart adjustments, this will foster a virtuous cycle of lower costs and expanded competition and coverage options for millions of working-class voters. First, Mr. Trump should eliminate any doubt that the cost-sharing subsidies that limit out-of-pocket expenses for over eight million Americans and stabilize the insurance markets will continue. He can do this by continuing to fund the subsidies through existing authority and by fighting a House Republican lawsuit challenging the program. Another alternative would be to support a bipartisan, permanent legislative proposal. Second, he should make clear that he will faithfully execute the law and instruct his secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, to maximize enrollment efforts and finalize rules that improve affordability, instead of undermining coverage. That will give insurers the confidence to stay in the marketplaces and lower premiums. Third, Mr. Trump should use his singular marketing skills to highlight the very real benefits of coverage. Past enrollment efforts have been constrained by insufficient resources and partisan attacks. Mr. Trump can create innovative ways to persuade people to enroll. Increasing enrollment will bolster private plans and marketplaces that are lagging, and potentially make insurance cheaper in many states. Finally, the president is well positioned to persuade governors and legislatures in the 19 states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid \u2014 almost all of which he won in the election \u2014 to cover four million more people. This would bring billions in benefits to their hospitals and help combat the opioid crisis. By keeping faith with his own voters, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to combine good substance with good politics.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/how-trump-could-save-obamacare-and-help-himself.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T03:21:20-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-04-27T03:21:20-04:00", "abstract": "A pivot from \u201crepeal and replace\u201d to \u201crepair and rebrand\u201d could be smart politics for the president.", "title": "How Trump Could Save Obamacare, and Help Himself"}
