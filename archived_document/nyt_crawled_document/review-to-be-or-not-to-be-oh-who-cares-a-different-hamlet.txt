As the audience settles in at the Theater at St. Clement\u2019s, the performers pluck items of rich clothing from the bounty laid out onstage \u2014 a laced corset here, a gilt-edged ruff there \u2014 and piece by piece become inhabitants of Hamlet\u2019s world, not ours. \u201cHamlet. A Version\u201d is a riff on Shakespeare with no tiresome sentinels on the battlements, spying the ghost of the recently dead king. A politically minded caper by the Russian writer and dissident Boris Akunin, known for his detective novels, it starts with a dissolute Hamlet exercising a little droit du seigneur, groping an alarmed Ophelia in plain sight of her father and brother. At two acts and 100 minutes, there is little plumbing of Hamlet\u2019s psyche in this exceedingly handsome, surface-skimming production by Irina Gachechiladze. \u201cTo be or not to be, who cares?\u201d the Prince of Denmark (Matt Weiss) says, or said on Monday night, anyway; the line is not in Mr. Akunin\u2019s script. In either case, this is a play about intrigue: amid palace dysfunction, a corpse-strewn power grab. Mr. Akunin is far less concerned than Shakespeare is with the prince himself, though he does award a central role to Hamlet\u2019s pal Horatio (Khris Lewin). Unlike the doofuses Rosencrantz (Owen Scott) and Guildenstern (Michael Propster), visitors who in their own way fit right in, Horatio is a true foreigner at Elsinore, arriving not only from another place but also seemingly another time. Speaking in prose, he wears monochromatic, contemporary clothes. Does he know that his black leather trench coat (the costumes are by Heather Klar) makes him look like a thug? No matter. He seems affable enough, and he\u2019s always been such a good friend. \u201cI have an unusual occupation,\u201d Horatio tells Claudius (James Phillip Gates), Hamlet\u2019s throne-seizing uncle-turned-stepfather. \u201cI explore human nature, which means I have to do a lot of traveling. Yesterday I was in Wittenberg, today I\u2019m in Denmark, and tomorrow perhaps I\u2019ll be in Poland.\u201d Ominous? Could be. But in Denmark, he noses around, gumshoe-like, asking questions and supplying helpful information \u2014 often amusingly, in Mr. Lewin\u2019s solid and clear performance. On the subject of Hamlet\u2019s father, who mistook him in the dark for the prince: \u201cAs you know, they say ghosts have poor eyesight.\u201d Presented by Red Lab Productions and Roust Theater Company, in a translation by Ileana Alexandra Orlich, the play flits quickly from one scene to the next like a \u201cHamlet\u201d highlights reel. For Mr. Akunin\u2019s witty variation to work, the performances need to have some depth, yet Horatio is most of the time the only vivid presence. (An exception: Joy Hermalyn\u2019s guilt-stricken Gertrude, in a pivotal confrontation with Horatio.) Crowding out characterization, Ms. Gachechiladze makes design the real star. On the curving, white-string curtain backdrop of Cate McCrea\u2019s set, lush and fantastical projections by Michael Ivanishvili take us from room to room in the palace, where some walls drip and melt. Others have eyes and ears. The scenes that play out before them, alas, are too often dreary.", "title": "Review: To Be or Not to Be? Oh, Who Cares?
