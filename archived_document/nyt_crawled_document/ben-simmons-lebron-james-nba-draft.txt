{"text": "On the day LeBron James was having his victory parade in Cleveland, Ben Simmons spoke with me in a Manhattan hotel about anticipating his championship moment. That moment came at the N.B.A. draft a day later when Simmons, a 19-year-old who is coming off a single season at Louisiana State, was selected No. 1 by the Philadelphia 76ers. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal right now,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt probably won\u2019t hit me until I\u2019m in the city, I\u2019m actually part of the organization.\u201d On Thursday night, it hit him. \u201cIt honestly feels like all the pressure just has hopped off me,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cNow I can relax. I know where I\u2019m going to be. I know where I\u2019m headed.\u201d Simmons epitomizes the rare gem produced on the supply side of the basketball industry. At 6 feet 10 inches, he is a versatile player at home anywhere on the floor. Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, Simmons pushed his parents to send him to the United States after looking at YouTube clips, studying rankings and looking at his high school competition. \u201cPart of it was him saying, \u2018I\u2019m ready,\u2019\u201d his father, David, recalled. In 2013, Simmons moved to Florida and enrolled at Montverde Academy, which he led to three straight high school national championships. During the recruiting process, Simmons rejected the idea that a top player should naturally attend one of the most successful big-time programs. He said no to Kentucky and no to Duke. Instead he went to L.S.U., where his godfather, David Patrick, was the associate head coach. Patrick is now an assistant at Texas Christian. \u201cThe point for me was going to a school that didn\u2019t have a rich basketball history like a Kentucky or a Duke,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI knew it was going to be hard. I like a challenge. I accepted that.\u201d L.S.U. severely underachieved. There were injuries and problems with team chemistry issues. The Tigers did not make the N.C.A.A. tournament and elected not to participate in the National Invitation Tournament. \u201cIt was tough, because I\u2019ve never been on a losing team,\u201d Simmons said. But having ended up on one \u2014 and having shouldered the blame for the team\u2019s failures \u2014 will help Simmons in his transition to the N.B.A. if he does not get off to a flying start. \u201cThe experience at L.S.U. helped me understand that things are not always going to be perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cI was getting all of that thrown on me, but I had to deal with it, and it came with the territory.\u201d Simmons signed last March with Klutch Sports. The agency\u2019s highest-profile client is James, the top draft pick at 18 years old in 2003, who Simmons says has become a friend and a mentor. They talk frequently, discussing topics like footwork and how Simmons\u2019s life is about to dramatically change. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot just being around LeBron,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cPeople say things about him all the time, but he would never say anything back. That\u2019s what I learned from him: Don\u2019t retaliate to articles or pieces or to things that are said about me.\u201d Simmons is the subject of a documentary, \u201cOne and Done,\u201d scheduled to appear on Showtime in October. The film explores Simmons\u2019s journey from Australia to Florida to L.S.U. to the N.B.A. It illustrates the global system that delivers players to college programs in the United States. \u201cI think it\u2019s great because you\u2019re watching somebody go from high school to the N.B.A., and you see what\u2019s actually happening,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI want people to understand it\u2019s not all about the money, cars and things like that. A lot of different things go into this.\u201d The underlying question the film examines is whether the most talented high school athletes should be forced to spend a \u201csham year\u201d in college or play professionally outside the United States rather than having the opportunity to go straight to the N.B.A. \u201cI look at the N.B.A. as a job, a great job to have, so I think for me, I would have loved the opportunity to go to the N.B.A. out of high school,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not ready, you\u2019re not ready. If you are ready, I think you should be able top to go.\u201d He added: \u201cI enjoyed my time at L.S.U. I wouldn\u2019t change it for anything. My dad went to college \u2014 my sisters, brothers \u2014 so I felt like I just had to, and I enjoyed it.\u201d Simmons is the youngest of six children. His father, David, was born and raised in the South Bronx; his mother, Julie, is from Australia. David Simmons played college basketball at Oklahoma City University and spent his professional career in South America and finally in Australia, where he met and married Julie. \u201cI never would have imagined any of this,\u201d David Simmons said. \u201cThere was no plan for this. All of our kids were treated the same. They were all coached the same way. Ben just happened to be the kid who turned out to be 6-10 with the same skills they all had.\u201d Because of his high profile, his extraordinary skills and the desperation of the team that makes him their first selection, Simmons may have a shorter-than-usual honeymoon. In the era of social media, anyone can text a good game. Anyone can Facebook or Snapchat a good game. But at some point, you have to play a good game \u2014 especially if you are a high-profile rookie in championship-starved Philadelphia. \u201cI\u2019ll have time to mature and develop, and one day, hopefully, I can bring a ring to wherever I am,\u201d Simmons said. He smiled. \u201cLeBron did it,\u201d Simmons said. I reminded him that James had left Cleveland, then returned. \u201cI think it had to happen,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt helped him mature his game, understand how to be a better player, teammate and leader. He came back to Cleveland knowing how to win a championship.\u201d Impressive insight from a 19-year-old who will have to remind a forlorn franchise what winning looks like.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/sports/basketball/ben-simmons-lebron-james-nba-draft.html", "published_date": "2016-06-22T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T10:00:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T10:00:06-04:00", "abstract": "Simmons had to spend a year in college before becoming draft eligible but has still learned valuable lessons from James, who joined the league straight out of high school.", "title": "Ben Simmons Looks to LeBron James as Model as N.B.A. Draft Looms"}
