It was once home of the Parade Bar, a watering hole known for its velvety red interiors, its Orientalist paintings depicting half-nude Nubians and its illustrious clientele. Among its regulars was one Jane Auer Bowles, an extravagant woman of elfin physique who, by the end of her days, had taken to wearing a conspicuous wig. To many of the locals, she was magnouna, the crazy one. At the Parade, where she drank herself into a stupor most nights, she was said to have stripped naked on more than one occasion. Few knew she was a writer. She was rumored to have published one novel, in her 20s, and to have never produced much of anything again. Jane Bowles died in 1973 at the age of 56. The outlandish biographical details are irresistible, and yet they cast a heavy shadow over the work. In the years since her death, Bowles, who was married to Paul Bowles, the author of \u201cThe Sheltering Sky,\u201d has been reduced to an eccentric, dipsomaniacal sideshow \u2014 a footnote to histories of the Beats, a favorite ancestor for select lesbians and the discerning absurdist. The Library of America\u2019s publication of her collected works stands to introduce the author\u2019s crooked, sui generis prose to a new generation of readers. \u201cA fey sort of person who works just as hard at her lunacies as the rest of us do trying to keep on the mundane side.\u201d This is how one of Jane Bowles\u2019s cousins described her to Millicent Dillon, the editor of the Library of America collection. People who met Bowles inevitably came away with an indelible sense of her strangeness and charm. Alice B. Toklas said Bowles was \u201cnot surprisingly like her novel.\u201d The novel, of course, was \u201cTwo Serious Ladies,\u201d a tale of two bourgeois women who go seriously off-piste, seeking spiritual salvation in the lowbrow and louche. While Miss Goering trades her stately home for a gloomy shack and is delighted to be taken for a lunatic, Mrs. Copperfield ditches her husband for a young Caribbean prostitute. The heroines were a composite of Jane herself, who had been born into a respectable Long Island family but chafed at her milieu\u2019s prohibitions. When \u201cTwo Serious Ladies\u201d was published in 1943, readers were baffled. Bowles was heartbroken and didn\u2019t produce all that much after; the Library of America collection includes a smattering of short stories, fragments and letters. But it does encapsulate a kooky universe featuring a cast of misfits and visionaries who are out of touch, out of style. (She once complained of Carson McCullers: \u201cHer freaks aren\u2019t real.\u201d) Above all, Bowles was a dizzyingly original stylist, and the texture of her writing and her dialogue in particular \u2014 staccato, self-confidently awkward \u2014 is unmistakably her own. \u201cYou have a very special type of beauty,\u201d a fellow tells Miss Goering in \u201cTwo Serious Ladies\u201d; \u201ca bad nose, but beautiful eyes and hair. It would please me in the midst of all this horror to go to bed with you.\u201d Bowles the letter-writer is also a pleasure, a leaky faucet whose correspondence reveals her famous equivocation and her demonic wit (\u201cI find myself staring at my writing materials from the couch as though they were \u2018Nazis,\u2019\u201d she once wrote to a friend). In 1948, she moved to Tangier, drawn to the city\u2019s odd-fangled customs, and in particular to Cherifa, a handsome peasant woman with \u201ca laugh like a savage,\u201d according to Paul Bowles. Gaining Cherifa\u2019s affections became her central obsession \u2014 the Bowleses, though devoted, slept with others \u2014 and, not unlike one of her own questing characters, she wrote of feeling she was \u201con the edge of something.\u201d She also wrote of her growing anguish over her inability to write. Tangier \u201cwas good for Paul, but not good for me,\u201d she said. But she insisted it was where she had to be. In a short story called \u201cEast Side: North Africa,\u201d the narrator runs her finger along a wall in an unnamed Arab town: \u201cI remember that once I reached out to touch the beautiful and powdery face of a clown because his face had awakened some longing; it happened at a little circus but not when I was a child.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T07:00:22-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/the-extravagant-jane-bowles-always-on-the-edge-of-something.html", "item_type": "Article"}
