{"text": "KATHMANDU, Nepal \u2014 The rescue team had nearly given up when it spotted distant figures on a ledge. Over the course of 47 days, since two young Taiwanese trekkers wandered off the trail in a snowstorm, the searchers had tried almost everything: aerial surveys by helicopter, bushwhacking through deep forest, trying to follow the movements of vultures. The father of Liang Sheng-Yueh, one of the missing students, had even consulted an astrologer. But they found nothing. Alerted by a fellow searcher who saw what he assumed were two bodies on the ledge, the leader of the rescue team, Madhab Basnet, carefully made his way to the site, using a handmade ladder the rescuers had quickly fashioned. When he reached the ledge, he was shocked when one of the two, an emaciated and badly weakened young man, spoke to him. He said that his girlfriend, Liu Chen Chi, 19, had died three days before. \u201cHe said his girlfriend was in a lot of pain and grief,\u201d Mr. Basnet said. \u201cHe said he ate salt and water and that\u2019s how he survived.\u201d Every trekking season in Nepal produces tales of physical endurance and heartbreak. They are rarely as extreme, though, as that of Mr. Liang, who was released from the hospital on Monday. He arrived having dropped from 150 pounds to 84 pounds, his hair infested with lice and with maggots eating the flesh of one foot. Doctors said he most likely survived because he was able to replenish the salt in his body and drink melted snow. It was not immediately clear where he got the salt, but Mr. Liang was an experienced climber who might have carried an extra supply in case of such a disaster. Ms. Liu appeared to have died of starvation, said Dr. Mani Maharjan, who performed an autopsy. Chakra Raj Pandey, medical director at Grande International Hospital, said Mr. Liang at one point turned to him with a strange request. \u201cHe asked me to provide him with a book that had maps,\u201d Dr. Pandey said. \u201cIt appeared to me that he wanted to look at a map and recall his trekking journey and probably find out where the journey went wrong.\u201d The two hikers, both students at National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan, arrived in Nepal for their trek in February and were last seen on March 9. After becoming disoriented in a snowstorm, they tried to follow the path of a river, in hopes that it would lead them to a settlement, Mr. Liang told his rescuers and local news media immediately after the rescue. Since then, he has declined all interview requests at the behest of the Taiwanese government. As they made their way along the river, they slid into a ravine and became stuck on the ledge, where they took shelter in a cave. They remained there for more than six weeks. On either side of the ledge were steep rock faces, so they could not move up or down, and snow was falling outside, Mr. Liang told the rescuers. After 10 days, their food ran out, he said. Their parents, alarmed not to have heard from them, hired a search party on March 26, and the team set off the next day and continued to search for nearly two weeks. When that failed, they began a second. The lost trekkers were first spotted by Dawa Tamang, 55, a farmer who was helping the rescue effort. \u201cI went by using a machete in the jungle,\u201d he said. \u201cI went by the side of the river. It was risky for me to go through. I might have lost my life as well.\u201d But then he spied the two figures on the ledge. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch them,\u201d Mr. Tamang said. \u201cI came back and went to call my friends because I was told not to touch the bodies. I just saw them and then came back.\u201d They built a ladder out of a dead tree, expecting to retrieve the bodies. That is when Mr. Basnet descended to the ledge and, to his surprise, found Mr. Liang alive but too weak to stand. They fed him noodles hoping to build up his strength. \u201cWe were shocked and afraid,\u201d Mr. Basnet said. \u201cWe were thinking he was dead.\u201d They carried Mr. Liang to safety, while the young woman\u2019s body was airlifted from the ledge. Over six days in the hospital, Mr. Liang increased his weight by 13 pounds, the doctor said. \u201cI feel relaxed now, but can\u2019t recall the last 47 days,\u201d he told a reporter from The Himalayan Times. He celebrated his 21st birthday in the company of journalists, telling them that he had survived only thanks to the prayers of others. \u201cIf you look at his eyes and his face, you can see that he is excited about a new life,\u201d Dr. Pandey said. \u201cThis is called rebirth. But the happiness of rebirth is mixed with the loss of his girlfriend and the tragedy of staying in the mountains and enduring so much pain.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/asia/nepal-trekkers.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T12:54:19-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T12:54:19-04:00", "abstract": "Two Taiwanese trekkers spent 47 days stranded in a cave in the mountains of Nepal.
