{"text": "PAULISTA, Brazil \u2014 On the bed next to her brother, Ana Vit\u00f3ria da Silva Ara\u00fajo acted like the 1-year-old she was. She smiled and babbled. She played with a stuffed whale. She plucked the pacifier from her brother\u2019s mouth and the burp cloth from his shoulder. Her brother, Jo\u00e3o Lucas, seemed unaware of her, his eyes closed, his mouth making sucking motions. It was typical behavior for a newborn. But Jo\u00e3o Lucas is the exact same age as Ana Vit\u00f3ria \u2014 they are twins. Jo\u00e3o Lucas was born with microcephaly and other serious problems, the result of his mother being bitten by a Zika infected mosquito during pregnancy. But the virus that attacked his brain in the womb apparently spared his sister. The siblings are one of nine sets of twins identified in Brazil\u2019s Zika crisis, and scientists hope they can shed light on how the virus works generally and why it inflicts ruthless damage on some babies and not others. Twins often yield clues to medical mysteries because their biological similarities allow scientists to identify relevant differences. Determining why one twin became infected in the womb while the other did not may illuminate how Zika crosses the placenta, how it enters the brain, and whether any genetic mutations make a fetus more resistant or susceptible to Zika infection. Until recently, Brazil\u2019s Zika twins seemed to follow a pattern, said Mayana Zatz, a geneticist and molecular biologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The cases include two sets of identical twins, and both babies in each pair have microcephaly, she said. There are also six sets of fraternal twins, in which one twin has microcephaly, while the other appears unaffected. Since identical twins share one placenta while fraternal twins almost always have separate placentas, Dr. Zatz and other experts suggested that the Zika virus may have penetrated one placenta and not the other. Perhaps the virus entered through a weak spot in one placenta\u2019s membrane, said Dr. Ernesto Marques, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pittsburgh and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Recife, Brazil. Or if one fetus \u201ckicked the placenta,\u201d he said, inflammation from that bruise on the membrane could become a portal. But one set of twins has broken the pattern. Those twins are fraternal and had separate placentas \u2014 but both have microcephaly and other Zika complications. \u201cThe boy is more affected than the girl, but both are severe,\u201d Dr. Zatz said. That case complicates the theory. Dr. Vanessa van der Linden, who helped discover that Zika causes microcephaly and has treated some of the twins, said one explanation might be that in some fraternal cases Zika crossed both placentas, but the twins had genetic differences that influenced why only one became infected or \u201cwhy the babies reacted differently to the virus.\u201d Dr. Marques suggested another possibility: that an impaired twin was exposed to Zika before the mother\u2019s body or the placenta developed immune responses against the virus and that the second fetus was infected slightly later. \u201cIt should reach both at an equal time,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if the virus hit one of the babies before the mother actually had developed protective immune responses, you have a problem.\u201d Dr. Zatz\u2019s lab has drawn blood from affected and unaffected twins, and is growing brain cells from their stem cells. She is testing to see which of those cells are susceptible to Zika infection. That could show whether some twins have genetic predispositions that make Zika infection more likely. Ultimately, Dr. Zatz expects to find an interplay of factors that can vary in each twin pregnancy. \u201cI believe,\u201d she said, \u201cthe explanation will be complex.\u201d For now, why Jo\u00e3o Lucas is devastated by the virus and his sister is not remains a mystery. When Jo\u00e3o Lucas and his twin sister were born in August 2015, their mother, Neide Maria Ferreira da Silva, was unaware he had microcephaly or brain damage, she said. He was born first and was temporarily placed in an oxygen chamber because of breathing problems. And the maternity hospital\u2019s \u201cdeformation doctor,\u201d a physician specializing in newborns with deficiencies, recommended he see a geneticist. But Ms. da Silva thought any problems would be mild, she said. She had already given birth to 10 children, starting when she was 17. It took a month before she brought Jo\u00e3o Lucas to the geneticist, who said \u201chis brain, it wasn\u2019t like ours,\u201d Ms. da Silva, 42, recalled. \u201cIt was going to be always very small.\u201d She was shocked. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel sad or upset,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought about how it was going to be when he grows up\u201d and realized \u201cI will have to take care of him more than the other kids.\u201d But his symptoms began overwhelming her. \u201cHe would fall asleep, and five minutes later he would start screaming,\u201d she said. Ms. da Silva was especially alarmed by Jo\u00e3o Lucas\u2019s seizures, which made him \u201cget purple\u201d and look \u201clike his eyes were going to jump out.\u201d Sometimes he became so agitated, he would scratch himself in the face, Ms. da Silva said. \u201cBlood would come out.\u201d Unable to cope with his care, Ms. da Silva started bringing him to a neighbor\u2019s cousin, who began caring for him. The caregiver, Val\u00e9ria Gomes Ribeiro, 46, brought the baby to his first appointment with a neurologist. The doctor prescribed clonazepam, an anti-anxiety drug, to calm him, but Ms. Ferreira still found that when Jo\u00e3o Lucas was home, something often went wrong. He developed pneumonia and eating problems, even what she called \u201can emotional fever\u201d because he seemed to miss Ms. Ribeiro, Ms. da Silva said. Ms. da Silva\u2019s 11-year-old daughter became pregnant and had an abortion, prompting a child protection agency visit. After Ms. da Silva told the caseworker that a friend was caring for her Zika baby, the agency investigated and initiated proceedings to remove Jo\u00e3o Lucas from her home. To keep him from being placed in a shelter, both women and the state agreed that Jo\u00e3o Lucas would live with Ms. Ribeiro, while Ana Vit\u00f3ria stayed with Ms. da Silva. Under court order, Jo\u00e3o Lucas spends Sundays at his biological mother\u2019s house. Ms. Ribeiro, who has adorned Jo\u00e3o Lucas with a bracelet and necklace hung with a good-luck charm called a \u201cfiga,\u201d tries to keep up with his many appointments. They include visits with a psychologist who shows Jo\u00e3o Lucas a panel of black and white squares to stimulate vision and rubs him with a sponge studded with Popsicle sticks to stimulate touch. On a visit last fall to Ms. Ribeiro\u2019s emerald green house on a dirt street, where the 23rd psalm hangs on a yellow wall, Ana Vit\u00f3ria toddled around, clutching a piece of spongy cake with one hand, thumping a table with the other. Reaching for her brother\u2019s mouth, she touched the green tape that therapists apply around his lips, fingers, back and chin to relax tight muscles. Ms. da Silva waved a rattle before Jo\u00e3o Lucas, but he did not respond. So far, his sister \u2014 like the other fraternal twins without obvious brain damage \u2014 appears unimpaired, but doctors are monitoring her and the others. At Ana Vit\u00f3ria\u2019s one-year exam, she was slightly behind developmentally. Her vocabulary was limited and she was slow to point to her mother when the doctor asked, Ms. da Silva said. That could be unrelated to Zika, but, she noted, \u201cThe doctor never said it\u2019s 100 percent sure that she doesn\u2019t have a problem.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/health/zika-twins-transmission-theories.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Health", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T12:20:21-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T12:20:21-04:00", "abstract": "While identical twins often share a fate, fraternal twins typically don\u2019t, a divergence that offers clues to researchers.
