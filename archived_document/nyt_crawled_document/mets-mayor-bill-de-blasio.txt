{"text": "The steps of City Hall had the look and feel of a celebratory moment in sports history three decades ago, with banners and bunting again marking an improbable, come-from-behind World Series victory by the New York Mets. A sparse but enthusiastic crowd of several hundred city workers, tourists and passers-by gathered. And from a small stage set high for the cameras, Mayor Bill de Blasio offered Dwight Gooden \u2014 the former Mets pitcher known as Doc, whose battles with drug addiction caused him to miss the original festivities \u2014 a chance on Friday to relive the 1986 moment. The city paid for the event, which had been conceived as a scene for a television series in development, produced by the sports radio host Amy Heart. So how did Ms. Heart get the city not only to pay for the backdrop of a scene in a television pilot but also have the mayor take part? By enlisting the influential lobbying firm of James F. Capalino, a friend and longtime donor to Mr. de Blasio whose business skyrocketed with the mayor\u2019s election. More recently, Mr. Capalino\u2019s name had been linked in the news media with questionable access to city officials and investigations into potential pay-to-play issues. Before the investigations came to light, Mr. Capalino bundled almost $45,000 for the mayor\u2019s 2017 re-election campaign. His firm, Capalino & Company, donated to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s political nonprofit, the Campaign for One New York, and the firm played an early role in what became a municipal fiasco surrounding the sale of the Rivington House nursing home to luxury developers, lobbying City Hall on behalf of the original owner, a nonprofit group. In August, Mr. de Blasio said that while Mr. Capalino was \u201ca friend, someone I talked to a lot over the years,\u201d he had stopped communicating with him. \u201cI do not have contact with him anymore,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at the time, \u201cbecause of the atmosphere we\u2019re in, and the ongoing investigations.\u201d Those state and federal investigations concluded last month with prosecutors harshly criticizing City Hall\u2019s fund-raising activities but bringing no criminal charges. City Hall enthusiastically promoted the event on Friday. Eric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, said on Sunday that neither Mr. de Blasio nor senior officials knew of \u201cthis Capalino connection.\u201d He said that a Capalino employee connected Ms. Heart with \u201can events coordinator in city government\u201d but that the Capalino employee had not noted that the firm was representing her. City Hall also seemed to be unaware that the event was for a television pilot, describing it as a \u201cdocumentary film\u201d in publicity material. (A spokeswoman for Ms. Heart called it \u201ca television pilot for a docu-series.\u201d) Mr. Capalino\u2019s company took on Ms. Heart as a client for no fee, according to a company spokesman, and representatives discussed her project by phone with City Hall officials. \u201cMs. Heart approached us with what we thought was a really inspiring idea,\u201d said the Capalino spokesman, James Yolles. \u201cWe have a few die-hard Mets fans on staff and took this on pro bono.\u201d The idea for the celebration of the former Mets players came about as Ms. Heart was working on what she intends to be a TV series about the human side of sports. The pilot episode, she said in a telephone interview, features Mr. Gooden and his former Mets teammate Darryl Strawberry and their struggles with addiction. Ms. Heart said that in her conversations with Mr. Gooden, he often discussed his regret at missing the 1986 World Series ticker tape parade, which passed through Lower Manhattan and ended at City Hall. (Mayor Edward I. Koch presided with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo; banners hung behind them.) \u201cI wanted to walk up the steps and wanted there to be a big crowd with the banners,\u201d Ms. Heart said of her idea for recreating that scene in her as-yet-unnamed show. \u201cAnd it happened.\u201d Ms. Heart said she \u201cwent through the proper steps\u201d in connecting with City Hall. Mr. Phillips could not say how much the city paid for the event, which included banners, extra metal detectors (which appeared to go unused), the stage and a camera area (which was erected and taken down by city employees), as well as an exhibit about the Mets inside the City Hall rotunda. \u201cThe Mets are an important part of our city,\u201d Mr. Phillips said in an email before the event. \u201cThis event took almost no resources to pull off.\u201d Ms. Heart said she did not know who paid for the preparations. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know the details.\u201d After Mr. Capalino\u2019s firm reached out less than two weeks ago, the mayor learned of the idea, calling it a \u201cstory of redemption\u201d in his weekly Friday radio appearance on WNYC. A fan of the Boston Red Sox, the losing team in the 1986 World Series, Mr. de Blasio presented Mr. Gooden with a key to the city on Friday. \u201cWe are gathered to complete a part of history, and I just want to check one thing \u2014 are there any New York Mets fans here?\u201d Mr. de Blasio asked during his address. As the producers had hoped, the crowd cheered.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/nyregion/mets-mayor-bill-de-blasio.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T20:23:55-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T20:23:55-04:00", "abstract": "A producer\u2019s idea to recreate a World Series celebration for TV became reality with the help of a lobbying firm whose ties to Mayor Bill de Blasio were part of investigations last year.", "title": "City Pays for Mets Moment, Guided by Firm With Troubled Ties to de Blasio"}
