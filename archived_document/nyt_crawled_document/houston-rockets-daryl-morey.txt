{"text": "MISSISSAUGA, Ontario \u2014 When Kyle Wiltjer interviewed with the Houston Rockets before last year\u2019s N.B.A. draft, he came prepared. He knew all about Daryl Morey, the team\u2019s general manager. He knew all about the Rockets\u2019 belief in analytics. He knew all about their fondness for the 3-point line. Wiltjer, a 6-foot-10 forward with a willowy jump shot, was as personable as he was knowledgeable, or at least that was the way he came across. \u201cHe was probably one of the greatest draft interviews of all time,\u201d Morey said in a recent telephone interview, \u201cwhich, honestly, sometimes makes me like guys less.\u201d In Morey\u2019s worldview, carefully circumscribed by data, charm does little but cloud judgment. For one thing, he could not tell if Wiltjer was being authentic. Was it all an act? Morey also worries that coaching staffs are susceptible to playing favorites with players like Wiltjer and giving them more minutes than they actually deserve. \u201cHe was like the student who sits in the front row, giving an apple to the teacher and sucking up to everybody,\u201d Morey said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get him to break form.\u201d It was an odd strike against Wiltjer, who had no idea at the time, or even for months afterward, how close he had come to blowing it during his interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was that good,\u201d he said. But if Morey had misgivings, he also saw potential and signed Wiltjer as an undrafted free agent. Wiltjer emerged as another experiment for a team that continues to push basketball boundaries. While the Rockets were setting N.B.A. records this season for the most 3-pointers attempted and made, Wiltjer, 24, was launching shots from distant galaxies for the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, Houston\u2019s affiliate in the N.B.A. Development League. In 31 games with the Vipers, including the playoffs, Wiltjer took 313 3-pointers, which worked out to a league-leading 10.1 attempts a game. \u201cIn this system, you\u2019re supposed to do what you do well,\u201d Wiltjer said before the Vipers\u2019 season ended last week with a loss here to Raptors 905 in the D-League finals. \u201cSo if I\u2019m open, I\u2019m going to shoot it.\u201d His position, known in basketball parlance as the stretch 4, is vital to the Rockets. Ryan Anderson, who currently occupies that role for Houston Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, is one of the best in the business: a forward whose 3-point shooting spaces the floor. Anderson\u2019s mere presence means that defenders have a tougher time cluttering the lane to prevent Houston\u2019s dynamic point guard, James Harden, from driving. The Rockets have used the formula to great effect. They went 55-27 in the regular season, and they will face the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference semifinals starting Monday. As for Wiltjer, the Rockets would love for him to develop into what Morey described as a Ryan Anderson type. They cannot employ enough 3-point artists. \u201cI do think he\u2019s on track to help us more next year,\u201d Morey said. An all-American at Gonzaga, Wiltjer had offers to sign elsewhere last summer but thought the Houston system was a good fit for his unique skill set. (Remember, he had done ample research on the team.) \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of stretch 4s out there,\u201d Wiltjer said, \u201cso when I heard that D\u2019Antoni was going to be the coach and that Ryan was coming in, it was almost too good to be true on my end.\u201d For the Rockets, Wiltjer was a bargain-bin pickup. He was also insurance. Anderson, who averaged 13.6 points a game while shooting 40.4 percent from 3-point range during the regular season, has a four-year deal with the Rockets worth $80 million that runs through 2020. \u201cWe thought if Ryan were injured, Kyle would be a guy who could step in,\u201d Morey said. Wiltjer spent the regular season shuttling between Houston, where he made cameos in 14 games for the Rockets, and the organization\u2019s D-League lab in Hidalgo, Tex., where the Vipers play their home games. The Vipers mimicked the Rockets in almost every conceivable way. Same sets. Same terminology. Same roles. As Anderson\u2019s D-League facsimile, Wiltjer averaged 20.7 points and 6.9 rebounds a game while shooting 38.7 percent from 3-point range. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to extend my range because of him,\u201d Wiltjer said of Anderson. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s the N.B.A. line, and he\u2019s shooting 2 feet behind the line.\u201d At the same time, Wiltjer has learned to cope with the inevitable ups and downs of professional life. First, there was the disappointment of going undrafted. \u201cYou want to hear your name called,\u201d he said. Then he had to overcome the psychological hurdle of being sent to the D-League for the first time. Nobody, he said, really wants to be in the D-League. But he learned to embrace it, he said, as the best opportunity for him to expand his game. There are other players \u2014 more than a few \u2014 who view it as basketball purgatory. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d Wiltjer said, \u201cbecause you come down here \u2014 and I won\u2019t name names \u2014 but you see some guys you grew up watching, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s a beast!\u2019 And then you go out and play against them, and it\u2019s almost disappointing. You realize why they\u2019re down here.\u201d Morey believes in the D-League. He thinks of it as an incubator for players, for staff members and even for ideas. During the 2013-14 season, for example, the Vipers obliterated all kinds of records for 3-point shooting while deliberately avoiding midrange shots \u2014 a brash experiment that has had a lasting influence on the organization, and on the rest of the N.B.A. \u201cThat obviously gave us the confidence, along with Coach D\u2019Antoni\u2019s belief in it, that if we ramped up our style of shooting from distance a little more than most teams, then it could work,\u201d Morey said. In terms of player development, Morey does not subscribe to the long-held theory that young players are capable of absorbing wisdom by sitting on the bench. He believes that players need to play, and he cited Clint Capela, now the Rockets\u2019 starting center, as one of the Vipers\u2019 more notable success stories. \u201cMost guys are pretty mad about it when they get assigned to the D-League,\u201d Morey said. \u201cBut usually after five or 10 games of being down there, they enjoy it. They realize: Hey, I\u2019m here. I get to play. I get to have a big role versus just watching from the bench. But Kyle was enthusiastic about it from the beginning. Kyle may be the most enthusiastic D-League player we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Matt Brase, the Vipers\u2019 coach, said that Wiltjer had worked to improve his rebounding and his defense, two areas of relative weakness. In particular, the Rockets want him to be able to defend different types of forwards: big forwards, slow forwards, quick forwards, small forwards. Brase said that Wiltjer had been fully invested in the process. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of guy who will call me at night or hit me up the next morning: \u2018Hey, did you see the wrinkle the Rockets added on this play?\u2019\u201d Brase said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to learn as much as possible.\u201d Wiltjer has rejoined the Rockets ahead of their series against the Spurs. His contract includes a team option for next season. In the language of an organization that lives by hard numbers, Wiltjer said he would like to stick around. \u201cOh, 100 percent,\u201d he said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/sports/basketball/houston-rockets-daryl-morey.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T14:11:20-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T14:11:20-04:00", "abstract": "Kyle Wiltjer averaged just over 10 3-point attempts in the D-League this season as he tries to develop at a position vital to Houston\u2019s success.", "title": "6-Foot-10 and a 3-Point Shooter.
