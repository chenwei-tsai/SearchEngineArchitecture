{"text": "Wells Fargo\u2019s board and management are scheduled to meet shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting Tuesday in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. With the phony account-opening scandal still making headlines, and the company\u2019s stock underperforming its peers, it\u2019s a good bet the bank\u2019s brass will have some explaining to do. How could such pernicious practices at the bank be allowed for so long? Why didn\u2019t the board do more to stop the scheme or the incentive programs that encouraged it? And where, oh where, were the regulators? Wells Fargo\u2019s management has conceded making multiple mistakes over many years; it also says it has learned from them. In a meeting this week with reporters at The New York Times, Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, said the bank had made substantive changes to its structure and culture to ensure that dubious practices won\u2019t take hold again. But there\u2019s a deeper explanation for why Wells Fargo\u2019s corrosive sales practices came about and continued for years. And it has everything to do with the bank-friendly regulatory regime in Washington and the immense sway that institutions like Wells Fargo have there. This poisonous combination contributes to a sense among giant banking institutions that they answer to no one. The capture of our regulatory and political system by big and powerful corporations is real. And it is a central and disturbing theme in the new book by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight\u201d contains juicy but depressing anecdotes about how our most trusted institutions have let us down. It also shows why, years after the financial crisis, big banks are still large, in charge and, basically, unaccountable for their actions. \u201cIn too many of these organizations, there are rewards for cheating and punishments for calling out the cheaters,\u201d Ms. Warren said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cAs long as that\u2019s the case, the biggest financial institutions will continue to put their customers and the economy at risk.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s no-nonsense views are bracing. But they are also informed by a thorough understanding of how dysfunctional Washington now is. This failure has cost Main Street dearly, she said, but has benefited the powerful. Wells Fargo got a lot of criticism from Ms. Warren, both in her book and in my interview \u2014 and on live television during the Senate Banking Committee hearing on the account-opening mess in September. She was among the harshest cross-examiners encountered by John G. Stumpf, who was Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive at the time. \u201cYou should resign,\u201d she told him, \u201cand you should be criminally investigated.\u201d (Mr. Stumpf retired the next month.) This week, Ms. Warren called for the ouster of the company\u2019s directors and a criminal inquiry into the bank. \u201cYes, the board should be removed, but that\u2019s not enough,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere still needs to be a criminal investigation. The expertise is in the regulatory agencies, but the power to prosecute lies mostly with the Justice Department, and if they don\u2019t have either the energy or the talent \u2014 or the backbone \u2014 to go after the big banks, then there will never be any real accountability.\u201d Banks are not the only targets in Ms. Warren\u2019s book. Others include Wal-Mart, for its treatment of employees; for-profit education companies, for the way they pile debt on unsuspecting students; the Chamber of Commerce, for battling Main Street; and prestigious think tanks, for their undisclosed conflicts of interest. My favorite moments in the book involve the phenomenon of regulatory capture: the pernicious condition in which institutions that are supposed to police the nation\u2019s financial behemoths actually come to view them as clients or pals. One telling moment took place in 2005, when Ms. Warren, then a Harvard law professor, was invited to address the staff at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a top regulator charged with monitoring the activities of big banks. She was thrilled by the invitation, she recalled in the book. After years of tracking various problems consumers experienced with their banks \u2014 predatory lending, sky-high interest rates and dubious fees \u2014 Ms. Warren felt that, finally, she\u2019d be able to persuade the regulators to crack down. Her host for the meeting was Julie L. Williams, then the acting comptroller of the currency. In a conference room filled with economists and bank supervisors, Ms. Warren presented her findings: Banks were tricking and cheating their consumers. After the meeting ended and Ms. Williams was escorting her guest to the elevator, she told Ms. Warren that she had made a \u201ccompelling case,\u201d Ms. Warren writes. When she pushed Ms. Williams to have her agency do something about the dubious practices, the regulator balked. \u201cNo, we just can\u2019t do that,\u201d Ms. Williams said, according to the book. \u201cThe banks wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d Ms. Warren was not invited back. Ms. Williams left the agency in 2012 and is a managing director at Promontory, a regulatory-compliance consulting firm specializing in the financial services industry. When I asked about her conversation with Ms. Warren, she said she had a different recollection. \u201cI told her I agreed with her concerns,\u201d Ms. Williams wrote in an email, \u201cbut when I said, \u2018We just can\u2019t do that,\u2019 I explained that was because the Comptroller\u2019s office did not have jurisdiction to adopt rules to ban the practice. I told her this was the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s purview.\u201d Interestingly, though, Ms. Warren\u2019s take on regulatory capture at the agency was substantiated in a damning report on its supervision of Wells Fargo, published by a unit of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Wednesday. The report cited a raft of agency oversight breakdowns regarding Wells Fargo. Among them was its failure to follow up on a slew of consumer and employee complaints beginning in early 2010. There was no evidence, the report said, that agency examiners \u201crequired the bank to provide an analysis of the risks and controls, or investigated these issues further to identify the root cause and the appropriate supervisory actions needed.\u201d Neither did the agency document the bank\u2019s resolution of whistle-blower complaints, the report said, or conduct in-depth reviews and tests of the bank\u2019s controls in this area \u201cat least from 2011 through 2014.\u201d (The agency recently removed its top Wells Fargo examiner, Bradley Linskens, from his job running a staff of 60 overseeing the bank.) \u201cRegulatory failure has been built into the system,\u201d Ms. Warren said in our interview. \u201cThe regulators routinely hear from the banks. They hear from those who have billions of dollars at stake. But they don\u2019t hear from the millions of people across this country who will be deeply affected by the decisions they make.\u201d This is why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau plays such a crucial role, she said. The agency allows consumers to sound off about their financial experiences, and their complaints provide a heat map for regulators to identify and pursue wrongdoing. But this setup has also made the bureau a target for evisceration by bank-centric politicians. \u201cThere was a time when everything that went through Washington got measured by whether it created more opportunities for the middle class,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cNow, the people with money and power have figured out how to invest millions of dollars in Washington and get rules that yield billions of dollars for themselves.\u201d \u201cGovernment,\u201d she added, \u201cincreasingly works for those at the top.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/business/23gretchen-morgenson-wells-fargo-elizabeth-warren.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T13:21:04-04:00", "abstract": "In a new book, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts takes Wells Fargo to task, along with the system that let it get away with account fraud.", "title": "Elizabeth Warren on Big Banks and Their (Cozy Bedmate) Regulators", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Business Day", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T13:21:04-04:00"}
