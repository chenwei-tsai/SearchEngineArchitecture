{"text": "BERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 My dad and stepmom live in Mobile, Ala., and spend their vacation time an hour\u2019s drive away in Orange Beach, Ala. This means that, throughout my life, I have regularly vacationed there as well. Whenever I tell people in Berkeley, Calif., where I live, that I\u2019m headed to the beach in Alabama, they are shocked. Most people outside of the Gulf Coast have no idea that Alabama has beaches \u2014 even though if you look at a map of Alabama, there is a part of it that looks as if it should belong to Florida. There is even a bar at the Alabama-Florida border that commemorates this fact. That bar is named the Flora-Bama. (Calling it the Ala-Lorida would just be ridiculous.) I often try to convince my wife, Melissa, that we and our two daughters should vacation in Orange Beach more often. I try to persuade friends to come, too. It is the perfect fun-and-sun vacation. We stay across the street from the beach, which is perfect for my wife. The resort has an old-school arcade room with one of those claw machines, which is perfect for our older daughter, even though she has never won anything from it. And it has a lazy-river pool, where you can sit in an inner tube and let the underwater jets push you around while thinking that you may be experiencing the pinnacle of human achievement. That\u2019s perfect for me. But no one has taken us up on the invitation yet, because of one problematic word: Alabama. Nobody I know from the Bay Area has any interest in purposefully spending time in Alabama. Florida, maybe, but Alabama? Nah, that\u2019s a hard pass. I have discovered that when you are black, saying \u201cI\u2019m headed to the South\u201d to someone, especially a white person who is not from the South, is like saying, \u201cI\u2019m headed to my own lynching and I decided to bring the rope just to make it easier on the Klansmen.\u201d It is one of my enduring frustrations with this country. People live in their part of the Union, and if they don\u2019t travel a lot, then there is a tendency to believe that the other parts of America couldn\u2019t possibly be as American as their part. You can see it in the way people in the South scrunch up their faces when they hear words like \u201cNew York,\u201d \u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cchallah.\u201d And you can also see it in the way people on the coast narrow their eyes when they hear words like \u201cLouisiana,\u201d \u201cKentucky\u201d and \u201cpork rinds.\u201d Sometimes it gets even worse. Some people think that the things going on in other parts are actually anti-American. I\u2019m happy that I know how to speak \u201cSouthern.\u201d I spent a lot of time in Alabama throughout my life. I even lived there for part of junior high and high school, so I learned the true beauty and mastery of the Southern dialect. \u201cY\u2019all\u201d is one of the greatest and most useful words ever invented. Saying you are \u201cfixing to get ready to go\u201d is useful, because it is a state most of us are regularly in, even if we don\u2019t know it. It means you are thinking about maybe leaving. That is me, every time I try to go out of the house. Southern is more than just a language. It\u2019s also about understanding someone\u2019s intentions. There are things people in the South say to me that I just let go, but if someone outside the South says the same thing, I\u2019ll think to myself, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be telling this story onstage tonight.\u201d I was in a Walgreens in Northern California once, back when I still had long dreadlocks. The cashier, a white woman, asked as she was ringing me up, \u201cCan I touch your hair?\u201d When you have dreadlocks you start to get used to this question. I said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t touch my hair,\u201d but I said it with a smile so that we could both move on without the situation getting weirder than it already was. A few months later, in Mobile, I was at a Krispy Kreme with my dad. A different white woman asked the same question and I said, \u201cSure.\u201d I could tell that she was taking a chance by asking. It felt like more than the idle curiosity or simple objectification that I felt in Northern California. Maybe some part of me hoped that she would touch my hair, her eyes would glaze over, and then like Neo from \u201cThe Matrix\u201d she would say something like, \u201cI now understand how the institution of slavery is directly connected the current struggle of black people in America, and I also recognize white people\u2019s part in that \u2026 also, I know kung fu.\u201d That didn\u2019t happen. But she did give me an extra doughnut. Those types of interactions prepared me for my current career, where I travel the country and ask (and occasionally answer) \u201cdumb questions.\u201d When I created a pilot for CNN called \u201cThe United Shades of America,\u201d I tried to roll all of that experience up into an hour of television. I went to Kentucky and talked to the Ku Klux Klan. When the episode aired back in a distant time called April 2016, the major criticism I heard was: \u201cWhy are you giving the K.K.K. a platform? We already know the K.K.K. is awful.\u201d Well, my mom taught me that there is no such thing as too much knowledge. And as gobsmacked as my liberal friends were by Donald Trump\u2019s victory, they now know that they definitely didn\u2019t know as much about America as they thought. And if there was ever a time that we all should take a trip to the other parts of America and spend some time to get to know the people there, it is now. So, who wants to come with me to Orange Beach?", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/opinion/sunday/expand-your-world-go-to-the-beach-in-alabama.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T14:44:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-04-29T14:44:03-04:00", "abstract": "My friends in Berkeley never want to head to the South.
