So they did something about it.", "text": "I had hoped readers would enjoy following a food vendor around on the streets of Manhattan for a day, but I hadn\u2019t expected the story I wrote about Kabir Ahmed to take on a life of its own. Mr. Ahmed, 46, immigrated from Bangladesh 23 years ago and now works five or six days a week selling chicken biryani and other hot dishes out of a halal food cart in the Financial District. The job is difficult and unglamorous, like many jobs in the food industry. It does not pay well. Mr. Ahmed\u2019s wife had mentioned to him, in passing, the idea of saving up for a family cruise in the Caribbean. It was a luxury that Mr. Ahmed knew they could not afford for their family of six, but for some reason it had stuck with him. \u201cHave you been on a cruise?\u201d he\u2019d asked me on the day I spent reporting with him. \u201cWhat is it like?\u201d At the end of my article (which ran in the Food section on April 19), I wrote about Mr. Ahmed\u2019s longing to go on vacation. Not long after my piece was published, readers sent emails asking how they could be helpful. I suggested they buy lunch at food carts, and tip well, especially on rainy days when business slows down. I also proposed learning more about the Street Vending Modernization Act, the New York legislation introduced last fall that would lift the cap on food vending permits, which Mr. Ahmed strongly supports. Then one reader, Jennifer Nelson, started a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for Mr. Ahmed and his family and their dream vacation. Ms. Nelson, a general manager at Buttermilk Channel, a restaurant in Brooklyn, read the article on Wednesday and posted it to Facebook. \u201cI wrote a comment about how I wish I had money to buy this family a vacation,\u201d she said. \u201cImmediately, people started commenting that they wished they did too.\u201d Ms. Nelson did a quick search for Caribbean cruises to estimate the cost for a family of six. Then she started a GoFundMe campaign and set the goal at $3,000. \u201cI hope they can do something that might have seemed a little out of reach before,\u201d she said. Many readers felt a connection to Mr. Ahmed, who is one of more than 10,000 people, most of them immigrants, who make a living selling food on the city\u2019s sidewalks. But when I first asked him if I could follow him around for a story in the paper, he was surprised. \u201cA story about me?\u201d he\u2019d asked. I explained that it would involve me pestering him all day questions, but that in the end people might get to know him a little and understand what it\u2019s like to work as a vendor. He said O.K. When I showed up at his house in Queens, Mr. Ahmed opened the door for me and a photographer, An Rong Xu, clearing toys and snack wrappers from his sofa to make space for us. He opened a box of kaju halwa, a soft, buttery sweet made from cashew nuts, as if we were family. I had to keep reminding him that I was working, too, and he didn\u2019t have to worry about taking care of me. \u201cWriting stories is a job?\u201d he\u2019d said, teasing me. At the end of the day, after hopping in and out of his 10-foot-long metal cart a hundred times, jotting down notes on his recipes and watching a series of cute dog videos together, Xu and I both felt lucky to be reporting a story about Mr. Ahmed. \u201cIt was like spending a day with my own father,\u201d Xu wrote to me. This past Friday, a couple of weeks after I had spent that day with Mr. Ahmed, I stopped by his cart to show him that the GoFundMe campaign for his family had reached over $5,000. \u201cI cannot believe this, I cannot.\u201d he said. Since the article was published, Mr. Ahmed\u2019s cart has been extra busy, he told me, and everyone seemed to know his name. His wife liked the story very much, he said, and his customers seemed to like it, too. But I wanted to know what Mr. Ahmed thought about it. \u201cMy son liked the story,\u201d he said. As we shared a doughnut, it occurred to me that Mr. Ahmed hadn\u2019t read the piece. \u201cI started to read it on the train,\u201d he promised me, \u201cbut then I fell asleep. You know, Tejal, I was very tired.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/insider/street-vendor-crowdfunding-a-well-deserved-break.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:29:54-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "Crowdfunding a Well-Deserved Break", "item_type": "Article"}
