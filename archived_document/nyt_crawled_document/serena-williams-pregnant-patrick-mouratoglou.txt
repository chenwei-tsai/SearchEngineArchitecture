Full of optimism for the 2017 season after Williams\u2019s commanding march to the title, he did not rule out the possibility of another run at the true Grand Slam \u2014 winning all four major tournaments in a calendar year. Mouratoglou had no idea at that stage that Williams was pregnant. \u201cI don\u2019t know who knew, but I didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Nice, France, on Friday. \u201cShe told me 15 days ago.\u201d Williams announced her pregnancy publicly on Wednesday, with her spokeswoman, Kelly Bush Novak, confirming that Williams is expecting a child \u201cin the fall.\u201d \u201cHonestly, I was only half surprised,\u201d Mouratoglou, 46, said of Williams revealing her pregnancy to him on the telephone. \u201cI was actually expecting it, because I know her by heart. I know how to read between the lines, even if she had told me nothing.\u201d Williams and Alexis Ohanian, an American entrepreneur, announced their engagement in late December. Ohanian traveled to Australia and attended Williams\u2019s matches in Melbourne. Williams later withdrew from the tournaments at Indian Wells, Calif., and Miami in March, citing knee problems because, as Mouratoglou confirmed on Friday, she was not yet ready to announce her pregnancy. \u201cI imagine she wanted to wait to announce, like many women,\u201d said Mouratoglou, who added that he had very little contact with Williams in the weeks after the Australian Open. \u201cNot much,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t looking for the contact, and in light of the situation, if she didn\u2019t want to announce it or talk about it, it was not in her interest to have much contact.\u201d Mouratoglou expressed delight for Williams and Ohanian. From a tennis perspective, he said he was not upset about missing the chance to chase more titles in the coming months. \u201cHonestly, not,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not disappointed because I know how important what is happening right now is for her, and I also know there\u2019s a really good chance that she\u2019ll come back afterward. What is fabulous is all these challenges, and now there\u2019s a new challenge that\u2019s incredible. She\u2019ll be over 35 and a new mother trying to win Grand Slams.\u201d Mouratoglou, a confident and enterprising Frenchman, recently opened a large tennis academy near Nice after having operated an academy in the Paris suburbs for years. He is also a prominent television analyst and has been one of the biggest factors in Williams\u2019s late-career renaissance. When they began working together in 2012, Williams was 30, and Mouratoglou said she told him that she wanted to win one last major singles title. She has far exceeded that. She won her first tournament with Mouratoglou \u2014 Wimbledon in 2012 \u2014 and has gone on to win 10 major singles titles and an Olympic gold medal in singles with him as her coach. Once involved romantically, Mouratoglou and Williams have remained a team professionally. With Mouratoglou\u2019s help, she has progressed from being a great player to having a strong case for being considered the greatest women\u2019s tennis player of all time. Her record outside the major tournaments has not been as consistently excellent as predecessors like Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf. Williams has, however, won more Grand Slam singles titles in the Open era than anyone, male or female, after breaking Graf\u2019s record in Australia. Williams won her first at the 1999 United States Open when she was just 17, and 18 years later she is just one short of the record of 24 held by Margaret Court, the Australian star whose career spanned the amateur and Open eras. \u201cThe thing that was very, very important for her was to beat this record of Steffi Graf, which she had, by the way, a difficult time doing,\u201d Mouratoglou said. \u201cI know there was a form of decompression after that, which I can perfectly understand. She\u2019s at an age where it\u2019s perfectly understandable that she wants to start a family, and I know she\u2019s had that desire, so it\u2019s a very good thing for her.\u201d Paradoxically, Williams will return to No. 1 in the WTA rankings on Monday despite not having played a match since her victory in Australia. It is unclear whether she will play another. She will turn 36 in September but has said that she intends to resume her tennis career. Mouratoglou said she told him the same thing and asked him to remain \u201con hold\u201d to coach her when she returns. \u201cI will think that over,\u201d said Mouratoglou, who added that he had no current plans to coach any other leading professional players. \u201cIt lightens my calendar, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Mouratoglou said of Williams\u2019s hiatus. \u201cBut I do lots and lots of things, and it will allow me the time to develop some of my other projects more quickly and more efficiently.\u201d Meanwhile, he sees it as \u201copening doors\u201d for those who will play for big titles in Williams\u2019s absence, among them Victoria Azarenka, who plans to return to the tour in July after having given birth to her son, Leo, in December. Maria Sharapova will return from her ban for a doping violation on Wednesday in Stuttgart, Germany. \u201cOf course she can be a factor, especially in the context of the moment,\u201d Mouratoglou said of Sharapova. \u201cShe will need time. She will win lots of matches 7-5 in the third, 6-4 in the third, but I think she\u2019s aware of that. There\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t be competitive.\u201d Numerous women have successfully resumed their professional athletic careers after childbirth. In tennis, the most prominent recent example was Kim Clijsters, who won three major titles after giving birth to her daughter, Jada, in 2008. But with Williams due in September, she will most likely be 36 \u00bd before she can resume competition, and she has set the bar so high that she may not be content at lower altitudes. \u201cAge is important for everyone, but I think Serena is unique,\u201d Mouratoglou said. \u201cShe has done, throughout her career, things that lots of people repeatedly said were impossible. So there\u2019s no reason to think this won\u2019t be possible, too. I think it is, but that said, it will all depend on her motivation. After she has a baby in her arms, we\u2019ll see.\u201d As someone who knows her \u201cby heart,\u201d does he genuinely believe she will come back? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say because it\u2019s a situation that\u2019s completely new and that she has never been through,\u201d Mouratoglou said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to imagine in advance how someone will react when they are a mother. It\u2019s so special and such a life change. I do think she\u2019ll come back, and she will come back all the more if everyone thinks she\u2019s done. So I encourage you to write that she\u2019s finished. Please.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T23:37:12-04:00", "abstract": "Hoping Williams could make another run at a true Grand Slam, Patrick Mouratoglou got a surprise when he learned she was pregnant.", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T23:37:12-04:00"}
