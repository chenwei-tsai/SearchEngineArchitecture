An image she published on Snapchat showed Williams posing in a mirror and the words \u201c20 weeks.\u201d There was no official confirmation by her representatives. The image was later removed from her channel. Congratulations had began to pour in from fellow players and tennis organizations on social media, but WTA Tour deleted its post. Williams, 35, won the Australian Open in January for her record-breaking 23rd Grand Slam singles title. If she is 20 weeks pregnant, she would have been pregnant during that tournament. She has not played a tournament since the Australian Open, withdrawing from events in Indian Wells, Calif., and Miami last month citing a knee injury. She is currently ranked No. 2 in the world, but will return to No. 1 next week despite the absence. In December, Williams announced her engagement to Alexis Ohanian on Reddit. He is a co-founder of that site. Williams is one of the greatest American athletes active today, and is the highest-paid female athlete in the world. She won her first Grand Slam singles title at 17 in 1999, and has spent more than 300 weeks at No. 1. Other top female tennis players have taken breaks from the game to have children. Williams\u2019s rival Victoria Azarenka, 27, had a son in December and is expected to be back on the tour in July.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/sports/tennis/serena-williams-pregnant-snapchat.html", "section": "Sports", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "Williams, who announced her engagement to the Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in December, published a photograph of herself in a mirror with the words, \u201c20 weeks.\u201d", "title": "Was Serena Williams Pregnant When She Won the Australian Open?", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T12:17:51-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
