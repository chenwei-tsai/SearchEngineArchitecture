Google\u2019s \u201cinteractive tours\u201d allow users to explore parts unknown \u2014 without leaving their cubicles.", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T08:53:50-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Technology", "title": "Google Earth\u2019s New Voyager Tool Aims to Feed Our Wanderlust", "material_type_facet": "News", "text": "Google has launched a cool new internet thing. And be warned: Your productivity may be about to take a tumble. Assuming you don\u2019t mind descending down a rabbit hole, you may want to check out Voyager \u2014 a \u201cshowcase of interactive tours\u201d meant to enhance the latest version of Google Earth. Voyager, which was introduced Tuesday, allows Earth\u2019s bored employees to feed their wanderlust and pretend they are somewhere \u2014 anywhere \u2014 other than the office cubicle they are actually sitting in. Say you\u2019ve never been to Paris. Voyager pairs the view provided by its maps with a still image and a so-called knowledge card to let users hop around the city as though they were on a packed three-day vacation. Similar tours of \u201cHemingway\u2019s Hangouts,\u201d Frank Gehry buildings and museums around the world are also available. Want a less urban experience? Jane Goodall will take you on a tour of a Tanzanian park and tell you about her team\u2019s chimpanzee research. You can even explore Afghanistan with Zari, a 6-year-old Muppet character who hails from the country. Zari loves to read and study \u2014 a fortunate trait because, as a knowledge card tells us, \u201cAfghanistan is home to one of the largest populations of young people in the world, but their education system is struggling.\u201d In a telephone interview on Thursday, Rebecca Moore, director of Google Earth, called stories and storytelling the \u201clinchpin\u201d of the new Google Earth and said Voyager would allow more people to tell such stories in more timely and compelling ways. \u201cWhat you\u2019re never going to find in Voyager is, \u2018Here\u2019s a tour of homes of celebrities,\u2019\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cWhat we want to do is inspire people to explore the world through this interactive educational experience. We see it as a way to bridge cultures.\u201d For more than a decade, Google Earth has allowed users to see the places they plan to visit before they actually do \u2014 or to revisit places they once knew. But as Google Earth became more ubiquitous, people found other ways to leverage it. Virtual flights over land and sea with Google Earth, it turned out, were an excellent way to learn about places, Ms. Moore said. \u201cIn an ad hoc, kind of grass-roots manner, people were using it to tell stories,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we realized is we wanted to take it to the next level.\u201d The latest update took two years to create, Gopal Shah, a Google Earth project manager, said in a blog post. Ms. Moore called it \u201cour gift to the world,\u201d noting that the tool is \u201cnot commercialized\u201d in any way. Melissa Parrish, a research director at Forrester, a technology and marketing research firm, said that Google sometimes does create projects \u201cjust because they can.\u201d But she said a company does not become as successful as the tech giant \u201cwithout thinking about the monetization possibilities of everything they do.\u201d Google may choose not to place ads directly on Google Earth or Voyager, Ms. Parrish said, but she added that every time a user clicks around the world, Google could presumably gather data it can use to target consumers elsewhere on the web. \u201cThey\u2019re Google,\u201d Ms. Parrish said. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing they\u2019re incredible at, it\u2019s making money.\u201d Voyager is among a number of new features within the revamped Google Earth. There are dozens of virtual trips currently available \u2014 including one through New York City \u2014 and Ms. Moore promised more to come. In the latest version of Google Earth, a \u201cI\u2019m Feeling Lucky\u201d button also emerges, allowing users to stumble upon random locations with a single click. (Kings Island amusement park in Mason, Ohio, anyone?) A new 3D button lets you see \u201cany place from any angle\u201d and share a \u201cpostcard\u201d of the view, Mr. Shah said in the blog post. Eventually, Ms. Moore said, Google plans to create a set of easy-to-use storytelling tools that will allow anyone to create tours similar to those in Voyager. \u201cThis is a time when the world is getting factionalized,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we need things to bring us together. We see Google Earth as making the world a smaller place \u2014 in a good way.\u201d And you thought finding your old house was fun.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T08:53:50-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/technology/google-earth-voyager.html", "item_type": "Article"}
