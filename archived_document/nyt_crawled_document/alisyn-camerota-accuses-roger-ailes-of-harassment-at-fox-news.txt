Ailes of saying \u201cgrossly inappropriate\u201d things to her and once inviting her to a hotel room when she asked for new opportunities at work. Mr. Ailes was ousted in July from the network he built into a conservative media powerhouse after multiple employees, including the former anchor Gretchen Carlson, accused him of sexual harassment. Ms. Camerota added her voice to that chorus on Sunday during an interview on the CNN show \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d \u201cYes, Roger Ailes did sexually harass me,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember being in Roger\u2019s office saying I wanted more opportunities,\u201d Ms. Camerota recalled, \u201cand he said: \u2018Well, I would have to work with you \u2014 I would have to work with you really closely \u2014 and it may require us getting to know each other better, and that might have to happen away from here. And it might have to happen at a hotel. Do you know what I am saying?\u2019\u201d Susan Estrich, a lawyer for Mr. Ailes, denied Ms. Camerota\u2019s claims in a statement to CNN. \u201cThese are unsubstantiated and false allegations,\u201d Ms. Estrich said. \u201cMr. Ailes never engaged in the inappropriate conversations she now claims occurred, and he vigorously denies this fictional account of her interactions with him and of Fox News\u2019s editorial policy.\u201d Mr. Ailes resigned from Fox News after a law firm hired by 21st Century Fox, the network\u2019s parent company, took statements from at least six women who said he had behaved inappropriately toward them. But the network\u2019s sexual harassment problems did not go away when he did. Bill O\u2019Reilly, a two-decade fixture at the network and the host of its most popular program, was forced out last week after a New York Times investigation found that Fox or Mr. O\u2019Reilly had paid five women about $13 million to settle harassment claims against him. Public protests, some outside Fox\u2019s New York office, led to an advertiser revolt. Mr. O\u2019Reilly has not appeared on television in almost two weeks but is set to make his first on-air comments since his firing on his podcast, \u201cNo Spin News.\u201d An advertisement for the podcast, which requires a paid subscription, appeared on his personal website, declaring: \u201cMonday. The No Spin News returns.\u201d On Sunday, Ms. Camerota, now with CNN, said that she had decided to ignore Mr. Ailes\u2019s advances in an attempt to forge ahead with her career but that she soon began to suffer \u201cemotional harassment\u201d at the hands of her boss. She said Mr. Ailes would angrily \u201cboom and bellow\u201d at her when he thought she was failing to inject conservative commentary into her news reports. \u201cHe targeted me because he sort of figured out early on that I didn\u2019t share his worldview,\u201d said Ms. Camerota, who said she did not want to include a political slant in her reporting. She said Mr. Ailes repeatedly told her, \u201cYou could be a real role model and a real star if only you could sound conservative.\u201d Ms. Camerota said on Sunday that she was hopeful the departure of both Mr. Ailes and Mr. O\u2019Reilly meant Fox News might develop a stricter attitude toward sexual harassment. Mr. Ailes\u2019s behavior \u201ccertainly had an impact in terms of the culture and the feeling there,\u201d she said. \u201cRoger was the king, and obviously everything trickled down from him,\u201d Ms. Camerota said. \u201cSo when he said grossly inappropriate things about women\u2019s bodies, there was a feeling there that that\u2019s more appropriate and you\u2019re not going to get in trouble for that.\u201d", "abstract": "Ms. Camerota, a former anchor, said Mr. Ailes, the former network chief, had made \u201cgrossly inappropriate\u201d statements to her and once invited her to a hotel room."}
