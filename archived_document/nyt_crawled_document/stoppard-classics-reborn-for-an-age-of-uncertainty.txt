{"text": "LONDON \u2014 Like many people in this discombobulating era of \u201cBrexit,\u201d the addled young man on the boat isn\u2019t sure exactly what the country known as \u201cEngland\u201d is, or if it even exists. \u201cI mean I don\u2019t believe in it!\u201d he says. Trying to imagine that island nation, he finds that \u201cI have no image.\u201d So speaks one of the title characters in David Leveaux\u2019s 50th-anniversary revival of \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\u201d Tom Stoppard\u2019s retelling of \u201cHamlet\u201d from the perspective of its most memorably forgettable figures, which shimmers like a mirage in the desert at the Old Vic Theater. It is, to be precise, Rosencrantz who theorizes about the nonexistence of England. Sorry, I mean Guildenstern. No, no, it\u2019s definitely Rosencrantz. I think. Everybody\u2019s always confusing these two longtime friends of a certain temperamental Prince of Denmark, including Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern \u2014 I mean, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz \u2014 themselves. The theatergoers who have made Mr. Leveaux\u2019s production a palpable hit are unlikely to be similarly befuddled, since Rosencrantz is portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe, who became world famous as the more proactive title character of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies before he proved his stage chops. Mr. Radcliffe, happily teamed with Joshua McGuire as Guildenstern, may be disappearing most appropriately into the role of Rosencrantz the nonentity. But fans are still mobbing the stage door, because they think they know who Mr. Radcliffe really is. Which would suggest they haven\u2019t absorbed the lesson of Mr. Stoppard\u2019s play. Across the Thames, another actor, also much beloved here, has been bringing exultant life to another of Mr. Stoppard\u2019s unwitting equivocators. That\u2019s Tom Hollander, star of the BBC comedy series \u201cRev,\u201d who recently appeared (deliciously) as the gay aide-de-camp of Hugh Laurie\u2019s evil arms magnate in the mini-series \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d Mr. Hollander incarnated the fumbling memoirist Henry Carr in Patrick Marber\u2019s seriously silly (or sillily serious) production of Mr. Stoppard\u2019s \u201cTravesties.\u201d (That \u201cTravesties\u201d revival, which originated at the Menier Chocolate Factory, ended its limited West End run on Saturday.) Henry, at least, has no doubts as to who he is, or was. Maybe. He was, he says, the British Empire\u2019s man in Zurich in 1917, and a close personal friend of James Joyce, Vladimir Lenin and the Dadaist poet Tristan Tzara, who all happened to be there at the same time. And if you would argue that historical data does not support Henry\u2019s account, which brims fulsomely with the misty clich\u00e9s of biographical writing \u2014 well, you\u2019re just being pedantic, aren\u2019t you? At a time when cultural and political identity is in disruptive flux in Britain (and most of Europe, and that big place across the Atlantic), Mr. Stoppard\u2019s opalescent uncertainty feels alarmingly on the nose. Past, present and future all look ominously cloudy as forecast by the young, precociously fatalistic Mr. Stoppard. This Czech-born dramatist, who turns (no!) 80 this summer, is now one of his adopted nation\u2019s most eminent men of letters, the author of plays of intellectual and emotional gravitas like \u201cThe Invention of Love\u201d and \u201cThe Coast of Utopia.\u201d The two early works by him that happily overlapped this season in major London productions are often regarded as the merely playful jeux d\u2019esprit of a giddy lad with an insatiable and compendious mind. Ha! The revelation of revivals by Mr. Leveaux and Mr. Marber is how profoundly touching these plays now feel. As Mr. Stoppard and the fans who have grown up with him edge closer to the void, these early contemplations of being and nothingness resonate with a new quiver. What\u2019s more, the kind of self-conscious metatheatrics Mr. Stoppard practiced in these works has become as common as London rain. And all their talk about facts not being, uh, factual? You don\u2019t need me to point out the raging topicality of such speculations. I saw \u201cRosencrantz\u201d and \u201cTravesties\u201d on the same day, fresh off the plane, and I had expected them to be heavy sledding. Instead, these comic fugues on masterpieces of English literature turned out to be perfect fare for a mind wrestling with the distortions of jet lag. I just went with the flow, and oh, the places they took me \u2014 from sophomoric sunniness to the shadows of mortality. The actors, as well as their directors, were excellent guides for such long-distance journeys. As Carr, an elderly British bureaucrat who recalls appearing in James Joyce\u2019s production of Oscar Wilde\u2019s \u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest\u201d as a young man in Zurich, Mr. Hollander wanders through the shifting landscape of a faltering memory. As he sheds decades, and a ratty dressing gown, to become the way he was, Mr. Hollander\u2019s Carr cuts capers both physical and verbal with his contemporaries Tzara (Freddie Fox), Joyce (Peter McDonald) and Lenin (Forbes Masson), all blissfully dashing and ridiculous. But as Carr keeps reliving his memories \u2014 with variations suspiciously informed by the cadences of Wilde \u2014 a lost look invades his sparkling eyes. And suddenly you feel bereft for him. Mr. Marber, himself a playwright (\u201cCloser\u201d), delivers the music-hall antics of \u201cTravesties\u201d with a joyful flourish. The same love of theatrical horseplay and artifice saturates Mr. Leveaux\u2019s production of \u201cRosencrantz.\u201d It\u2019s a point of view that registers with antic melancholy in Mr. Radcliffe and Mr. McGuire\u2019s portrayal of the title characters as a comic double act, sealed and doomed in their never-changing routine. Then there\u2019s David Haig\u2019s splendid turn as the leader of the band of traveling players, the same ones who perform the ill-fated \u201cMousetrap\u201d for the royal court of Elsinore. These old troupers have a firmer sense of who they are than poor Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Slightly, anyway. They really know they exist only if someone\u2019s watching them. All the same, in ambiguous times, there\u2019s a perverse ecstasy in watching the vagueness and vagaries of others embodied with such triumphant precision by a theater-drunk playwright and his players. O, the prophetic soul of Mr. Stoppard, whose younger self has resurfaced as both the poet laureate and court jester of our addled age of confusion.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/theater/stoppard-classics-reborn-for-an-age-of-uncertainty.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T15:14:51-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T15:14:51-04:00", "abstract": "Bright revivals in London find the prescience in a young playwright\u2019s tomfoolery.
