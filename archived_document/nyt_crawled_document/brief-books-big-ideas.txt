The months after Donald Trump was elected president have been boom times for scholars of authoritarianism. Masha Gessen wrote a widely circulated essay on the New York Review of Books website entitled \u201cAutocracy: Rules for Survival.\u201d In that vein, Snyder offers practical advice to #TheResistance in \u201cOn Tyranny,\u201d a brief book that started life as a Facebook post. Unlike public intellectuals who casually toss around the word \u201cfascist\u201d to describe a disappointing restaurant salad, Snyder knows this subject cold. He is a Yale University historian who has written at length on fascism, Communism and the Holocaust. That gives \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d a particular urgency. It is littered with vignettes of how Germans in the 1930s aided and abetted Hitler\u2019s rise to power. It is impossible to read aphorisms like \u201cpost-truth is pre-fascism\u201d and not feel a small chill about the current state of the Republic. Snyder warns, \u201cAmericans today are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism or Communism in the 20th century.\u201d He offers political advice ranging from straightforward (\u201cDefend institutions\u201d) to insightful (\u201cBe calm when the unthinkable arrives\u201d). For such a small book, Snyder invests \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d with considerable heft. At times, though, \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d veers toward overwrought. Trump\u2019s brand of populist nationalism may be illiberal, but it is also not very popular. Since his inauguration, a critical free press, independent judiciary, patriotic Civil Service and robust social movements have placed significant constraints on Trump\u2019s actions. When Snyder intimates that 2016 might be the last free election in the United States for a while, one wonders if the book will become self-defeating because of its hyperbole. Of course, just as I was pondering whether \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d exaggerates, Trump tweeted that the press is the enemy of the American people. That sounds awfully pre-fascist to me. So approach this short book the same way you would a medical pamphlet warning about an infectious disease. Read it carefully and be on the lookout for symptoms. THE SOUL OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT By Floyd Abrams 145 pp. Yale University, $26. Claims of American exceptionalism can be exaggerated. But the First Amendment really does make America unique, even within the industrialized democracies. No other country has such stringent protections against government restrictions of free speech and a free press. Abrams, a constitutional litigator, celebrates that fact in \u201cThe Soul of the First Amendment.\u201d The best part of this short primer is his history of free speech jurisprudence in the United States. Abrams reminds us that federal protections of free speech rights are of recent provenance. A century ago, obscenity laws and community standards provided ample reason to justify government censorship. States, localities and courts restricted the freedom of the press without much constraint for the country\u2019s first 150 years. The First Amendment was not applied to state censorship laws until 1925. Abrams traces the legal history of the First Amendment all the way through to Citizens United, a case in which he represented the plaintiffs. Liberals who despise that ruling would be well served to read this book. Whatever the policy merits of letting corporations spend unlimited amounts on political advertising, Abrams ably defends its legal reasoning. He is on shakier ground, however, when he compares the First Amendment with laws regulating speech in other established democracies. Abrams acknowledges, for example, that Germany\u2019s Nazi past makes it \u201cunderstandable\u201d to restrict hateful speech in that country. He then blithely notes that \u201cthe United States has been fortunate not to have suffered such horrific events.\u201d I suspect that some Native Americans and African-Americans would take issue with Abrams on this point. Abrams recognizes but offers no answers to the policy ramifications of Citizens United. He also seems willing to live with the social costs of actors like WikiLeaks publishing documents with no redaction: \u201cWhat to print? The First Amendment provides no answer to this question. It never does.\u201d WHY WALL STREET MATTERS By William D. Cohan 154 pp. Random House, $25. Economic populism has produced a bear market for attitudes about Wall Street. Public trust in banks dropped precipitously after 2008 and has not recovered. During his campaign, Donald Trump complained that \u201cWall Street has caused tremendous problems for us.\u201d As president, however, Trump has appointed several well-connected financiers. How should Americans feel about that? The moment is ripe for a short book that explains the merits and demerits of America\u2019s financial sector. Alas, Cohan\u2019s \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters\u201d is not that book. To be fair, he tries hard. Cohan repeatedly states that Wall Street is a marvelous contraption for allocating capital to the productive parts of the economy. The problem is that he offers no evidence for this claim beyond assertion. The closest he comes is when he stresses the success of Apple\u2019s initial public offering. On the questions of share buybacks or Libor manipulation or the financial sector being responsible for an increasing fraction of the American economy, he is silent. Cohan is correct on some important matters regarding regulation, as when he argues that the revocation of Glass-Steagall was not responsible for the 2008 financial crisis. Unfortunately, elsewhere he offers mere bromides. On Dodd-Frank he quotes a Wall Street executive: \u201cKeep the regulations that work and make sense and eliminate the rest.\u201d Good to know. Part of the confusion lies in what Cohan means by \u201cWall Street.\u201d He has an introduction entitled \u201cWhat Is Wall Street?\u201d that manages never to answer his own question. In the introduction he says Wall Street is not some \u201cstrange form of alchemy\u201d; but in the next chapter, he writes that \u201cit\u2019s a remarkable bit of alchemy.\u201d This kind of confusion persists throughout the book. The biggest problem with \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters\u201d is its black-and-white framing. Cohan asks at the beginning whether Wall Street should be thought of as a force for good or evil. The obvious answer is \u201cneither.\u201d Wall Street should be thought of as an amoral collection of profit-seekers. Alas, Cohan remains a prisoner of that dichotomy for the length of this small book.", "item_type": "Article"}
