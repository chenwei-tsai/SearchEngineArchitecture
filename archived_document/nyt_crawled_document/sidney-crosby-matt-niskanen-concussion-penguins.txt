{"text": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 The N.H.L. will not hold a disciplinary hearing for Washington Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen for his crosscheck that injured Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby on Monday night. Niskanen was given a five-minute major and a game misconduct. He said afterward that he did not intend to injure Crosby. The Capitals won the game, 3-2, in overtime to trim their playoff series deficit to two games to one. Crosby, the N.H.L.\u2019s leading scorer and one of the game\u2019s best players, left the game early in the first period and did not return. His status for Wednesday\u2019s Game 4 \u2014 and maybe the rest of the postseason \u2014 was uncertain. Penguins Coach Mike Sullivan said Crosby would be evaluated on Tuesday. Crosby has missed significant time over his career because of concussions. Crosby was skating by Washington goaltender Braden Holtby when he turned awkwardly after being stick-checked by Alex Ovechkin. He ended up facing Niskanen as his body was going toward the ice and took Niskanen\u2019s stick across the side of the head. Crosby was on the ice in obvious pain for several minutes before exiting slowly under his own power. Crosby entered the game tied for second in scoring for Pittsburgh in the playoffs with 11 points, including two goals in Pittsburgh\u2019s Game 1 victory over Washington.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/sports/hockey/sidney-crosby-matt-niskanen-concussion-penguins.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T12:40:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T12:40:10-04:00", "abstract": "The N.H.L. will not hold a disciplinary hearing for Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen for his crosscheck that injured Penguins star Sidney Crosby.", "title": "Niskanen Will Not Face Further Discipline for Hit on Crosby"}
