{"text": "The author of \u201cThe Lost City of Z\u201d and \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d thinks the president should read \u201cThe Road,\u201d by Cormac McCarthy, because \u201cit gives a sense of the fragility of the world.\u201d What books are currently on your night stand? My night stand is more like a geological structure: a bunch of books piled on the floor with its own strata. At the top layer are the newly accumulated books. Among the most recent additions are T. C. Boyle\u2019s \u201cThe Terranauts,\u201d Zadie Smith\u2019s \u201cSwing Time\u201d and Tana French\u2019s \u201cThe Trespasser.\u201d Then comes the layer of books further down, which, for a long time, I\u2019ve been planning to read but have not yet had a chance \u2014 though I vow to! These include Renata Adler\u2019s \u201cSpeedboat,\u201d Marlon James\u2019s \u201cA Brief History of Seven Killings\u201d and Norman Mailer\u2019s \u201cHarlot\u2019s Ghost.\u201d Finally, there are the books scattered about that I\u2019m continually excavating to look at again for inspiration, such as James Baldwin\u2019s \u201cCollected Essays\u201d; Saul Bellow\u2019s \u201cSeize the Day\u201d; Willa Cather\u2019s \u201cMy \u00c1ntonia\u201d; Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cThe Complete Stories\u201d; George Orwell\u2019s \u201cHomage to Catalonia\u201d; and St. Clair McKelway\u2019s \u201cReporting at Wit\u2019s End.\u201d The pile is constantly shifting and resettling and, on occasion, toppling. What\u2019s the last great book you read? Without question \u201cThe North Water,\u201d by Ian McGuire. It\u2019s like some weird channeling of Joseph Conrad and Cormac McCarthy, and yet remains its own original work. Even though I\u2019m a slow reader, I read it in two days. What\u2019s the best classic novel you recently read for the first time? I have lots of gaps in my education, and so I\u2019m often picking up classic books that most people read years ago. I recently read Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cThe Crying of Lot 49\u201d for the first time. In truth, I was assigned the book in high school but didn\u2019t understand a word of it. So I picked it up again and was shocked by how accessible and funny it is, and how devilishly it subverts my favorite genre of fiction, the detective novel. Not long ago I also read \u201cVictory,\u201d by Joseph Conrad, after discovering that it was one of Joan Didion\u2019s favorite books. The novel \u2014 which is about a man who has spent his life trying to isolate himself from the complications of the world, only to be drawn into its evil \u2014 is not without imperfections, but it\u2019s one of the best depictions I\u2019ve read of how humans succumb to a fatal mix of illusions and deceptions. What\u2019s your favorite book no one else has heard of? I\u2019m not well enough read to have a book that no one else has heard of. But an author who deserves wider recognition is John Joseph Mathews, the prose-poet of the Osage Indians, who died in 1979. His books, including his 1934 semi-autobiographical novel, \u201cSundown,\u201d capture what life was like on the Oklahoma prairie and the traumatic clash between white settlers and Native Americans. He is an exquisite stylist. Everyone should read him. Which writers \u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 working today do you admire most? Too many to list, but here\u2019s a start: T. C. Boyle, Robert Caro, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Don DeLillo, Joan Didion, Louise Erdrich, Denis Johnson, Jon Krakauer, Erik Larson, Janet Malcolm, Steven Millhauser, Candice Millard, Cynthia Ozick, Ann Patchett, Richard Price, Ron Rosenbaum, Philip Roth (even if he\u2019s no longer writing), Hampton Sides and Colson Whitehead. I\u2019ve also been fortunate to be able to work at The New Yorker, where I admire so many of my colleagues. And I have enormous admiration for newspaper reporters like David A. Fahrenthold and Maggie Haberman who are doing a public service by holding our government officials accountable. What\u2019s the last book to make you laugh? The author who consistently makes me laugh is Elmore Leonard, who had a perfect ear for American vernacular and who believed, as he put it, \u201cthe bad guys are the fun guys.\u201d The book that most recently made me laugh, though, was Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s \u201cThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.\u201d The book had been buried in my night stand pile for ages, until last year I finally pulled it out and read it. Not only are the scenes funny; the play of words in each sentence made me laugh. And like the best comic novels, it is really a tragedy. The last to make you cry? I don\u2019t cry too often reading books, but I did reading Francisco Goldman\u2019s autobiographical novel, \u201cSay Her Name.\u201d Like the author, the protagonist in the book loses his wife during a freakish accident while body surfing in Mexico. Though many books wrestle with guilt and grief and memory, Goldman explores these themes with unflinching honesty and emotional truth. The last book that made you furious? David Wyman\u2019s \u201cThe Abandonment of the Jews,\u201d which meticulously describes how the United States and other countries failed to pursue policies, including more open immigration, that could have saved countless people from extermination during the Holocaust. Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? Because I read so much nonfiction for work, I enjoy fiction most, especially detective novels and mysteries that keep me awake at night. I\u2019ll read anything by Megan Abbott, Eric Ambler, Kate Atkinson, Michael Connelly, John Grisham and Dashiell Hammett. I don\u2019t instinctively pick up science fiction, but if it\u2019s well written I can easily be swept away. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night? My mom was a publisher, and I grew up in a house full of hardcover books that still had the smell of freshly printed paper, and to this day I love to collect first editions by authors I admire. Yet I now have rather poor eyesight, and reading electronically \u2014 and being able to triple the font size \u2014 has been a modern wonder. As for my reading habits, they\u2019re rather strange and inexplicable. I won\u2019t read two novels at the same time, or two nonfiction books at the same time. It feels like a betrayal. However, I will often read one nonfiction book and one novel during the same period \u2014 though I usually read the former during the day and the latter during the night. How do you organize your books? Disastrously. And as my house has filled with children and pets and their accouterments I\u2019ve had to start storing books in boxes in my basement, and sometimes even in the garage, where they have acquired a rather foul odor. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? The only really surprising stuff comes from my research: books on the hunt for the giant squid, or hangings in the Old West, or what it\u2019s like to be eaten by maggots in the jungle. What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift? \u201cThe Eitingons: A Twentieth-Century Story,\u201d by Mary-Kay Wilmers, which my mother gave me. Wilmers, who is the editor of The London Review of Books, is a distant relative and delved deeply into the gothic history of our family, which included a member of Sigmund Freud\u2019s inner circle and apparently a notorious K.G.B. assassin. Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain? My favorite fictional hero is Dr. Watson, because unlike Sherlock Holmes, he bumbles through life like the rest of us; my favorite villain is the pig Napoleon in \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d who embodies the evil of absolute political power. What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I didn\u2019t become much of a reader until junior high, when I discovered the novels by S. E. Hinton. I raced through them, then stumbled upon Robert Cormier\u2019s \u201cI Am the Cheese,\u201d which has a twist at the end that still haunts me. Many of the books that were assigned in class \u2014 \u201cA Separate Peace,\u201d \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye,\u201d \u201cGo Tell It on the Mountain,\u201d \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God\u201d \u2014 all still stick with me, perhaps because I was more impressionable then or perhaps because my memory was still firing on all cylinders. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cThe Road.\u201d It gives a sense of the fragility of the world. Plus, each sentence is very short \u2014 about the length of a tweet. You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? I\u2019ll go with Thomas Pynchon, because I can dine on that for the rest of my life; Ambrose Bierce, because I can then solve the riddle of his death; and Margot Livesey, who is a wonderful novelist and the best writing teacher I ever had. Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? There was a time in my life when, if I started a book, I was determined to finish it. I still remember my misery getting to the end of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged.\u201d In recent years, I\u2019ve become more coldhearted and will often quickly ditch a book I don\u2019t like \u2014 yet I\u2019m not so coldhearted to name names. Whom would you want to write your bio?  Janet Malcolm once compared the biographer to a \u201cprofessional burglar, breaking into a house, rifling through certain drawers that he has good reason to think contain the jewelry and money, and triumphantly bearing his loot away.\u201d So I\u2019m going to lock the doors and keep away anyone who wants to write my life story. What do you plan to read next? Well, I was planning on finally tackling Mailer\u2019s tome \u201cHarlot\u2019s Ghost,\u201d but thankfully my 10-year-old daughter, Ella, gave me a reprieve and picked my next book: \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d which we plan to read together.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/books/review/david-grann-by-the-book.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:31-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:31-04:00", "abstract": "The author of \u201cThe Lost City of Z\u201d and \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d thinks the president should read \u201cThe Road,\u201d by Cormac McCarthy, because \u201cit gives a sense of the fragility of the world.\u201d", "title": "David Grann: By the Book"}
