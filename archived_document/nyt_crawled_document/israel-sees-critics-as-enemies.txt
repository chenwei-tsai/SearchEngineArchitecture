{"text": "The refusal of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  to receive the German foreign minister because of a meeting the German held with a veterans\u2019 peace group is not in itself a major incident in Israeli-German relations. Germany\u2019s history alone ensures it will remain Israel\u2019s staunch supporter. What is troubling, rather, is Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s increasingly illiberal pattern of treating critics of Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian lands \u2014 domestic and foreign \u2014 as enemies. The flash point in this case was a meeting Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, held with some nongovernmental groups while on a visit to Israel. One of these groups, called Breaking the Silence, is particularly reviled among right-wing Israelis because it gathers anonymous testimonies from Israeli soldiers about their service in occupied territories, often highlighting hardships imposed on the Palestinians. So Mr. Netanyahu canceled his meeting with Mr. Gabriel, proclaiming that he would not welcome diplomats who met with organizations that, he said, \u201cslander\u201d Israeli soldiers. It is understandable that Breaking the Silence would rankle some Israelis, because it raises questions about one of the most respected institutions in Israel \u2014 the army. And there can be a debate about whether Mr. Gabriel was unnecessarily provocative. But Breaking the Silence has support from former high-ranking Israeli military officers and has generated debate about what kind of society Israel wants to be. More broadly, the occupation, now approaching 50 years, has been consistently criticized by the United States and much of the rest of the world, and has been a source of fiery debate within Israel. The prime minister\u2019s response, moreover, comes on the heels of other Israeli measures that reflect a hardening of positions on the occupation. An Israeli law in early February retroactively legalized Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land; another in March barred entry into Israel to foreigners who publicly support the international boycott movement against the country. It may be that Mr. Netanyahu feels emboldened by the coming of the Trump administration to harden his line. But even President Trump has asked Mr. Netanyahu to \u201chold back on settlements,\u201d and on Wednesday the State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, declared that groups like Breaking the Silence were \u201ca vital part of any functioning democracy.\u201d Israel\u2019s vibrant democracy has always been one of its great strengths, and it is in open and democratic debate \u2014 and not in a threatening \u201cwith us or against us\u201d posture \u2014 that issues as critical to Israel\u2019s future as the occupation must be discussed.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/israel-sees-critics-as-enemies.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T08:38:11-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "created_date": "2017-04-28T08:38:11-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s snub of the German foreign minister after his meeting with a peace group shows a dangerously illiberal attitude.", "title": "Israel Sees Critics as Enemies"}
