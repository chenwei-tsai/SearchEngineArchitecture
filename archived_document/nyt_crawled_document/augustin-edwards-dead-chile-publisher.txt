He was 89. El Mercurio confirmed his death. An article in the paper said he had been in an induced coma for almost two months since returning from medical treatment in New York, where he had experienced complications after an operation. Mr. Edwards was heir to a corporate empire built after his ancestor George Edwards had emigrated to Chile from London in 1804. Successive generations of Agust\u00edn Edwards \u2014 as all the family\u2019s firstborn males have been named \u2014 amassed a fortune in mining, banking, agriculture, publishing and even whaling, while delving into politics and diplomacy. Mr. Edwards took the reins of the family business at 29 after his father\u2019s sudden death in 1956. Two years later, he was presiding over El Mercurio. Mr. Edwards\u2019s great-grandfather, Agust\u00edn Edwards MacClure, founded El Mercurio in the port city of Valpara\u00edso in 1827. It is the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in the world. El Mercurio in Santiago was founded in 1900. Today, El Mercurio group controls three major newspapers and over 20 regional papers throughout the country. El Mercurio has served both as a mouthpiece for Chile\u2019s conservative and business elites and as a political force in its own right. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Edwardses used their political and economic prowess to shape Chile\u2019s politics and policies, backing right-wing candidates and governments. In the late-19th century they had an important role in sparking both Chile\u2019s Civil War and in the Pacific War with Bolivia and Peru, according to V\u00edctor Herrero, author of the award-winning 2014 book \u201cAgust\u00edn Edwards Eastman: A Declassified Biography of the Owner of El Mercurio.\u201d \u201cYou cannot understand modern Chilean history without taking into account the history of the Edwards family,\u201d Mr. Herrero said in a recent interview. \u201cSubmerged in the logic of the Cold War, Edwards embarked his companies and media outlets in a relentless war against international communism. He was probably Chile\u2019s last \u2018Cold War\u2019 warrior.\u201d Agust\u00edn Edwards Eastman was born on Nov. 24, 1927, in Paris to Mar\u00eda Isabel Eastman and Agust\u00edn Edwards Budge. At the time, his father was an executive at the Paris branch of the J.P. Morgan bank. The younger Mr. Edwards grew up in England and Chile and studied law at the University of Chile, though he did not complete his studies there. He graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton in 1949. Mr. Edwards was presiding over El Mercurio when Mr. Allende campaigned in 1970 for the presidency and promised revolutionary changes. He promptly began using his business and political contacts in the United States to urge American officials to intervene to prevent an Allende victory, traveling to Washington to make his case. To further that cause, his newspaper group received money from the Central Intelligence Agency. When the effort failed with the election of Mr. Allende in September 1970, Mr. Edwards immediately put El Mercurio in the service of destabilizing the new Socialist government. Days after the election, Mr. Edwards met with Richard Helms, the director of C.I.A., at the request of President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, according to United States government records that have since been declassified. Mr. Edwards discussed with Mr. Helms the timing for a possible military coup against Mr. Allende and those who might take part in it. \u201cEdwards not only advocated a pre-emptive military coup in his meeting with Helms, but also supplied intelligence on potential coup plotters that the C.I.A. could enlist,\u201d said Peter Kornbluh, head of the Chile Declassification Project at the National Security Archive in Washington. \u201cBased on the declassified record, history will remember him for his betrayal of the democratic institutions of his own country.\u201d El Mercurio went on to spearhead a propaganda campaign against the Allende government, again drawing C.I.A. support \u2014 about $2 million. El Mercurio had been receiving C.I.A. funds since the 1960s, the declassified documents show. Nevertheless, President Allende did not crack down on El Mercurio or any other media outlet during his administration. By then Mr. Edwards had fled with his family to the United States. There, his friend David Rockefeller, president of Chase Manhattan Bank, now known as Chase Bank and part of JPMorgan Chase, helped the family get settled, and they eventually bought a home in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Edwards took an executive position under another friend, Donald Kendall, the chief executive of PepsiCo, in nearby Westchester County. (Mr. Rockefeller died in March.)  Mr. Allende was overthrown by the military in September 1973 and died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds during the coup. El Mercurio pledged immediate loyalty to the new military rulers, led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet. It was one of the few newspapers allowed to publish, as it continued to receive C.I.A. funds to portray the military junta \u201cin a positive light,\u201d according to the declassified documents. Mr. Edwards returned to Chile in 1975 and resumed control of his publishing group. Throughout General Pinochet\u2019s 17-year dictatorship, El Mercurio lent credence to the military\u2019s misinformation campaigns and denied the extensive, and well-documented, human rights violations taking place. In September 1991, one of Mr. Edwards\u2019s sons, Cristi\u00e1n, then 33, was abducted by a left-wing organization and held for nearly five months before being released when the family paid a $2 million ransom. Cristi\u00e1n Edwards later moved to the United States and worked for The New York Times, becoming president of The New York Times Syndication Sales Corporation, president of The New York Times News Service and vice president of New York Times Digital. He is now executive vice president of El Mercurio. In 2015, the Chilean Journalists Association Ethics Tribunal expelled Mr. Edwards from the organization because of his papers\u2019 past ties to the C.I.A., its actions to subvert democracy and its history of covering up human rights crimes under the Pinochet government. Last year, Mr. Edwards\u2019s name appeared in the so-called Panama Papers, the 11.5 million documents leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which had helped some of the world\u2019s wealthiest people \u2014 including politicians, athletes and business moguls \u2014 establish offshore bank accounts. He was listed as one of the clients. Besides his son Cristi\u00e1n, his survivors include his wife, Mar\u00eda Luisa del R\u00edo; five other children, Agust\u00edn, Isabel, Carolina, Andr\u00e9s and Felipe, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren.", "abstract": "Mr. Edwards was heir to the company that published El Mercurio, an influential right-wing publication that helped overthrow Salvadore Allende in 1973.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/americas/augustin-edwards-dead-chile-publisher.html"}
