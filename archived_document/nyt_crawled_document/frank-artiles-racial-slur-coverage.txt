But one noteworthy occasion arose last week when a Florida state senator went on a profanity-soaked tirade in an exclusive club with other colleagues. The senator, Frank Artiles, used not just that word but a raft of other epithets that led first to an apology and four days later to his resignation. The Miami Herald and other local media were all over it, and soon the national media was too \u2014 CBS, Politico, USA Today, Fox, HuffPost and, after Artiles stepped down, The Times. The question before editors was this: How do you capture the news value of such an outrageous and sustained rant without filling your own networks and newspapers with the same obscenities? The range of answers was wide. The Miami Herald went all out, leaving no reader guessing what precisely Artiles said. The Times and others relied more on euphemisms like the \u201cN-word.\u201d In its recounting, the Times story said Artiles, a Republican, used \u201ca racial slur for black people and other vulgarities\u201d after seeing some colleagues at a bar, including fellow Senator Audrey Gibson, who is black. The Times story also said he had used \u201ctwo expletives to refer to her,\u201d citing a Miami Herald story, and it noted that Artiles maintains that he \u201cdid not say the \u2018N-word\u2019 but used a derivative of it.\u201d Now here\u2019s what was actually said, according to one of several Miami Herald stories: \u201cSpotting [Gibson] at the Governors Club Lounge in downtown Tallahassee around 10:30 p.m., Artiles, who had been drinking, confronted Gibson: \u2018Audrey, stop being a bitch on my bills and I\u2019ll stop being a fucking asshole on yours.\u2019\u201d It went on: \u201cBy the end of his tirade, Artiles had called Gibson a \u2018girl,\u2019 Senate President Joe Negron a \u2018pussy\u2019 and Republicans who had elected Negron \u2018niggas.\u2019 By the end of the week, Artiles had resigned, succumbing to pressure from a Senate overcome by the scandal.\u201d If you only read The Times, your sense of what actually occurred would be more vague. You would assume that the \u201cN-word\u201d or something like it was used, but you\u2019d have to deduce exactly what. The benefit of this sans-specifics approach is that readers who revolt at seeing such slurs on a general interest news site won\u2019t be subjected to them. But if you read The Miami Herald, you\u2019d more fully appreciate the uproar, and the rarity of hearing such a crude outburst by an elected official. Artiles is hardly a national figure, but the sustained sexist and racist attack \u2014 in the company of an African-American colleague no less \u2014 was far beyond the usual \u201chot mic\u201d stories that periodically surface. I went to the editor who made the call for The Times, Peter Khoury, to hear his thinking about why the explicit language was avoided. Citing the Stylebook, which gives guidance on language usage, Khoury said he didn\u2019t feel as if the specific words spoken were necessary for this story. \u201cI didn\u2019t think this was a case where anyone would have a hard time figuring out what the guy said,\u2019 said Khoury, night editor on the Express desk. \u201cIt was a modest story. No one was denying anything, and he had already resigned.\u201d Khoury is right \u2014 he followed the Stylebook precisely. (Although as it turns out, two wire stories published before The Times decided to do its own story did break house rules by using explicit language. Whoops.) Politico took an approach more resembling The Miami Herald\u2019s, only with a few less details. It used the \u201cN-word\u201d higher up in the story but \u201cniggas\u201d lower in the piece. I asked Paul Volpe, executive editor of Politico, about the decision. \u201cI think for us it became pretty obvious that the use of the word was the story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would require some amount of contortion on our part to avoid it.\u201d I had the most thought-provoking conversation with Kirsten West Savali, associate editor of The Root, an African-American news and opinion site. West Savali, in the piece she wrote, used every word that the senator shouted that evening. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in providing cover for racism, so it was never a question for me,\u201d said West Savali. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to protect the sensibilities of those who are offended by that language.\u201d West Savali noted that the media covers a lot of violence. It describes and photographs bombings that kill and mutilate, and yet it often sidesteps the violence of speech. \u201cWe should call it what it is instead of saying, \u2018Let me put an asterisk there to make it a little nicer,\u2019\u201d she said. Reasonable people could hear the same set of facts in cases like that of the Florida senator and come to different conclusions. Could you give readers the most compelling account without describing what he said? Would repeating the language be gratuitous or more honest? Sometimes it\u2019s worth revisiting questions we think we know the answer to, asking whether the choices we made in the past still stand up. Who are we protecting by avoiding offensive language? And at what cost? Or are we engaging in a whitewashing without even realizing it?", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/public-editor/frank-artiles-racial-slur-coverage.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T15:58:08-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "title": "Intemperate Words, Temperate News Coverage", "item_type": "Article"}
