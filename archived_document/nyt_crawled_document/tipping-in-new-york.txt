But when it comes to tipping, there still seems to be widespread uncertainty, along with complaints about tip inflation and creeping concern about tip ubiquity. News that New York City may require the ride-hailing app Uber to provide passengers with the option to tip drivers has once again stirred the debate over tipping. It is an argument that has been playing out for more than a century. In 1916, in an essay called \u201cThe Itching Palm: A Study of the Habit of Tipping in America,\u201d the author William R. Scott made the case that tipping culture was an offense to democracy. \u201cA waiter, knowing that his compensation depends upon what he can work out of his patron, employs every art to stimulate the tipping propensity, from subtle flattery to outright bulldozing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe weaves a spell of obligation around a patron as tangible, if invisible, as the web a spider weaves around a fly.\u201d But for those who work in the service industry, the system remains built on gratuities. Olivia Kenwell, 25, has been a bartender at Broadway Dive and its sister bar, the Dive Bar, on the Upper West Side for three years and said that relying on tips can be an uncertain proposition. \u201cTips are my livelihood,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s feast or famine, either you do exceptionally well or you don\u2019t. You can\u2019t depend on getting a certain amount, otherwise you\u2019ll be disappointed.\u201d For Luis Ramirez, a barista at Earth Caf\u00e9 on the Upper West Side, the advent of payment applications like Square \u2014 with its suggested tipping screen \u2014 has encouraged largess. A year ago, he was working at a cafe that relied on the old-fashioned tip jar. \u201cI got $2.30 working 7 to 1 p.m.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like nothing at all.\u201d Now, with customers prompted to tip by an app, he said he made between $50 and $100 in gratuities while doing the same amount of work. \u201cWhen they pay for a coffee and see the screen asking about tip, it\u2019s subconscious,\u201d he said. \u201cThey decide to do it.\u201d Occasionally a customer voices frustration at being asked to tip, but he thinks tipping is fair. \u201cIt takes more time to make you a really good coffee than it does for a bartender to open a can and pour a beer on draft,\u201d he said. Edie Campbell-Urban, a spokeswoman for Square, said that data on consumers\u2019 habits, gathered by the company, showed that subtle social pressure could increase tips. For example, people are more likely to tip if not doing so requires clicking on a \u201cno tip\u201d option. And nearly half of the people surveyed said proximity to the server or cashier while entering a tip amount would \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d increase their likelihood to tip. Michael Lynn, a professor of consumer behavior at Cornell University\u2019s School of Hotel Administration, said that consumers\u2019 relationship with tipping was not always what one would expect. Mr. Lynn has been examining consumer data from a now-defunct laundry service that offered home pickup and delivery service. A year into the business, a tipping option was introduced. \u201cOver all, it looked like customer satisfaction increased after the tipping function was added,\u201d he said. Mr. Lynn explained that people\u2019s approval of tipping could be related to the entire experience becoming easier for the consumer. But what if tipping was removed? In New York City, the restaurateur Danny Meyer caused a stir when he eliminated the tipping options at his restaurants in 2015. But some places that followed his lead have decided to reinstitute tipping because of consumer backlash. Mr. Lynn cautioned that it was also \u201ceasy to overestimate people\u2019s awareness and knowledge of the social norm\u201d when it came to tipping. He conducted a study of diners that asked how much they should tip after a meal. \u201cI was shocked that some one-third of people did not say 15 to 20 percent,\u201d he said. Over all, he said, helping consumers with their tipping decisions was something they liked. \u201cWhen a company facilitates tipping, that just makes it easier on the customer,\u201d he said. When businesses set suggested tips too high, however, they run a greater risk of no tip at all.", "abstract": "How much to tip, and in what situation, is an argument that has been playing out for more than a century.
