{"text": "Last week, prosecutors in Massachusetts agreed to throw out more than 20,000 drug convictions dating back to 2003 because a single crime lab chemist, Annie Dookhan, admitted in 2012 that she had doctored or completely made up drug test results for years. It was the biggest dismissal of its kind in American history. And it should have happened years earlier. Instead, prosecutors dragged their feet like sullen children avoiding homework, making one excuse after another for why they shouldn\u2019t have to do the right thing and dismiss convictions based on obviously tainted evidence. The scandal is far from the only one to come out of forensic labs, and for a simple reason: Prosecutors and other law enforcement officials, who oversee the labs, want to win cases. As a result, they cling to techniques that are of questionable value at best, if they aren\u2019t provably useless. A 2015 review by the F.B.I. found that its forensic hair-sample analysts testified wrongly in favor of the prosecution 96 percent of the time. And even reliable scientific practices require strict protocols and aggressive oversight to protect against the Annie Dookhans of the world. The reliability of these labs \u2014 many of which are overworked and understaffed \u2014 will only suffer more because of the Trump administration\u2019s knee-jerk bias for law enforcement. On April 10, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he would disband the nonpartisan National Commission on Forensic Science, which was established four years ago to make forensic science independent from the win-at-all-costs mind-set of so many prosecutors. In Massachusetts, prosecutors absurdly claimed that they had no duty to tell defendants that their cases had been handled by Ms. Dookhan, and that each defendant needed to prove that Ms. Dookhan\u2019s mishandling of evidence had been responsible for his or her individual conviction. Only after the state\u2019s highest court rebuked the district attorneys in January for their \u201cunacceptably glacial systemic response\u201d did prosecutors agree to vacate about nine in 10 of the 24,000 cases Ms. Dookhan handled between 2003 and 2011 \u2014 21,587 at last count. That is clearly the right outcome, but it\u2019s little comfort to the thousands of people wrongly imprisoned \u2014 some for years \u2014 or the thousands more who have continued to suffer the effects of a criminal record after they were released. Most of these people weren\u2019t even serious offenders. Nearly two-thirds were small-fry, convicted of drug possession only, according to an analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has represented Ms. Dookhan\u2019s victims since 2012. (She pleaded guilty in 2013, and spent three years in prison before being released on parole in 2016.) This scandal is another example of why Mr. Sessions\u2019s decision to scrap the forensic science commission was a mistake. The commission, which included scientists, law enforcement officers and judges, was often hamstrung by internal disagreement, but still managed to produce important certification requirements and reporting standards that would have made future lab scandals harder to pull off and easier to detect or prevent. Many in law enforcement are cheering, but Americans who care about due process, and the epidemic of wrongful convictions, should be worried.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/21587-reasons-to-fix-forensic-science.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T03:21:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "created_date": "2017-04-27T03:21:05-04:00", "abstract": "A yearslong scandal involving a tainted crime lab shows how far prosecutors will go to win.", "title": "21,587 Reasons to Fix Forensic Science"}
