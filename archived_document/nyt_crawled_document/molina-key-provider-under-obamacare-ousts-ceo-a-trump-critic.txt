{"text": "Dr. J. Mario Molina, the outspoken chief executive of the California health insurance company founded by his father, was abruptly removed from his position at Molina Healthcare, according to an announcement by the company on Tuesday. His brother, John, was also immediately replaced as the chief financial officer. Dr. Molina, the subject of a profile in The New York Times earlier this year, was one of the foremost critics of the steps taken by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to overhaul the federal health care law. Under his leadership, Molina, which specializes in providing care to low-income individuals, had become a mainstay of the individual insurance markets created by the law. The company signed up about one million customers in the state marketplaces, and it offers Medicaid plans in 12 states and Puerto Rico. In announcing its decision on Tuesday, Molina\u2019s board issued a statement: \u201cIn light of the company\u2019s disappointing financial performance, the board has determined to change leadership in order to drive profitability through operational improvements,\u201d the company said. attempts to reach Dr. Molina for comment were unsuccessful. Molina had been struggling financially, reporting that it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year, which the company blamed on the flawed formula used by the government. Dr. Molina repeatedly warned that Molina could withdraw from the markets if federal officials failed to make changes to the program. As recently as last week, he wrote a letter to Congress urging them to provide critical funding for low-income customers. Joseph W. White, Molina\u2019s chief accounting officer, will temporarily fill the two brothers\u2019 roles, according to the company, which pointed to Molina\u2019s weak profits as reason for the decision to replace them as executives. Molina\u2019s shares rose sharply on the news. The company, which postponed its annual shareholder meeting until next week, is holding a call with investors later on Tuesday to discuss its first-quarter earnings.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/health/molina-key-provider-under-obamacare-ousts-ceo-a-trump-critic.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Health", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T15:18:46-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T15:18:46-04:00", "abstract": "Dr. J.
