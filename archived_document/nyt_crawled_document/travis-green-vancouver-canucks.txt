{"text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 A chat toward the end of his playing career planted a seed in Travis Green\u2019s mind. A veteran center at the time, Green had already thought about staying in hockey after retirement when a conversation with Paul Maurice, then his coach with the Toronto Maple Leafs, got him thinking. \u201cWe were just talking one day, and he gave me the advice: \u2018You should be a coach,\u2019\u201d Green said. \u201cIt stuck with me.\u201d Some 10 years later, Green was introduced Wednesday as the 19th head coach of the Vancouver Canucks, tasked with injecting youth and offense into a franchise that has fallen on hard times. Green, a native of Castlegar, British Columbia, inherits a team that finished 29th in the N.H.L. and was near the bottom in several offensive categories, including setting a club record for futility with just 178 goals. That led to the dismissal of Willie Desjardins after three seasons in charge. \u201cWe have to create more offense,\u201d Green said. \u201cOur special teams have to get better. I think there\u2019s a way you can create offense nowadays with the way the game is played, but that\u2019s definitely an area where we\u2019ll have to improve.\u201d Green, 46, spent the last four seasons coaching Vancouver\u2019s top farm team, the Utica Comets of the American Hockey League. After retiring as a player, he joined the Portland Winterhawks as an assistant in 2009 before leading the club to the 2012-13 Western Hockey League title and an appearance in the Memorial Cup final as interim head coach. In his first news conference at Rogers Arena, Green, flanked by the Canucks president Trevor Linden and General Manager Jim Benning, fielded several questions about his style and approach, especially with young players, for a team that seems a long way from respectability. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting up here saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to win the Stanley Cup next year,\u2019\u201d Green said. \u201cBut I will tell you we\u2019re going to get better. We\u2019re going to start the process of building the right culture.\u201d Part of that means getting young assets involved in the rebuilding program. The Canucks are still led by the identical twins Henrik and Daniel Sedin, who will turn 37 in September, but Vancouver has a promising group of younger players, including Bo Horvat, Sven Baertschi, Markus Granlund, Ben Hutton and Troy Stecher. Brock Boeser also impressed late in the season, while Jake Virtanen, another former first-round pick, spent most of 2016-17 with Green in the A.H.L. working on his game. Add in the Canucks\u2019 acquisition of Jonathan Dahlen and Nikolay Goldobin before the trade deadline, and Vancouver\u2019s having the second-best odds of winning Saturday\u2019s draft lottery, and Green should have plenty to work with next season. \u201cWe need to get younger, it\u2019s no secret,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to infuse more young players into the lineup.\u201d Green has no experience as an N.H.L. head coach, just as Desjardins had none he took over the Canucks June 2014. But Green, Vancouver\u2019s fourth head coach since May 2013, has never been an N.H.L. assistant, either. That lack of N.H.L. experience apparently did not concern the Canucks\u2019 brass, as Linden said Green had been the only candidate interviewed for the job, a process that took just two days. \u201cWe have a lot of faith in Travis,\u201d Linden said, adding that other clubs expressed interest in Green\u2019s services both last year and this spring. \u201cWe wanted to be really decisive,\u201d Linden said. Green led the Comets to the Calder Cup final in 2015, but they were eliminated in the first round last season before missing the playoffs entirely in 2016-17, when a number of players who were expected to stay on their roster instead wound up in Vancouver. As an N.H.L. player, Green scored 193 goals and added 262 assists in 970 games over 14 seasons with the Islanders, the Anaheim Ducks, the Phoenix Coyotes, the Maple Leafs and the Boston Bruins. He played for the coaching greats Al Arbour and Pat Quinn, among others. \u201cI\u2019ve taken something from every coach that I\u2019ve been under,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019ve not necessarily applied it, but learned from it to become the coach that I am today.\u201d He comes to Vancouver with expectations that could not be lower for a team that missed the postseason three of the last four years. Desjardins made the playoffs in 2014-15 with 101 points but followed that up with a 75-point effort in 2015-16 and a 69-point campaign this year, as the Canucks pivoted into a full rebuild over the season\u2019s final six weeks. While Desjardins was initially expected to guide an aging roster back into contention in the aftermath of Vancouver\u2019s run to within a game of winning the 2011 Stanley Cup, Green will probably have more of a leash to develop the Canucks\u2019 younger players, with less emphasis on the short-term results. \u201cThere\u2019s pressure whenever you coach,\u201d Green said. \u201cI like challenges. I like when our team has a tough game, has a big game. You learn a lot about your team when you have a challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous about it, I am excited about it.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/sports/hockey/travis-green-vancouver-canucks.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T20:39:27-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T20:39:27-04:00", "abstract": "Green, with no N.H.L.-level coaching experience, will have to develop Vancouver\u2019s roster after the club set a franchise low for goals this season.", "title": "Travis Green, New Canucks Coach, Will Focus on Youth and Offense"}
