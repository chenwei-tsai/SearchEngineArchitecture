{"text": "PRAGUE \u2014 The Czech Republic\u2019s prime minister offered his resignation on Tuesday, saying he could no longer work with his finance minister and political rival, a populist billionaire whose party is favored in elections set for October. The prime minister, Bohuslav Sobotka, said he would meet President Milos Zeman this week to formally submit his resignation and that of the cabinet. It was not immediately clear if Mr. Zeman would accept the resignations. At a news conference, Mr. Sobotka said he could not defend the conduct of the finance minister, Andrej Babis, a 62-year-old magnate-turned-politician who has rejected frequent comparisons to  President Trump. Mr. Babis, one of the country\u2019s wealthiest people, started a fertilizer company after the fall of Communism and, over the years, turned it into the Agrofert conglomerate that now employs 33,000 across a host of companies, including two newspapers, a radio station and a music channel on television. In 2011, Mr. Babis founded his own political party, ANO (the name means \u201cYes\u201d in Czech), and in the 2013 parliamentary elections, the party placed second, behind Mr. Sobotka\u2019s Social Democratic Party. The parties formed an uneasy coalition, and Mr. Babis was named finance minister. In January, the Czech establishment teamed up against Mr. Babis, enacting a law that would bar cabinet ministers from owning media firms or more than a quarter of any company seeking government contracts or European Union subsidies. Mr. Babis responded by declaring that he would place his business holdings in a trust. The controversy involves corporate bonds that Agrofert issued in 2012 under a program that allowed buyers of the bonds to enjoy a tax exemption on the interest. Mr. Babis bought some of the bonds himself. The authorities are looking into whether he benefited improperly from that transaction. Mr. Sobotka said that Mr. Babis had set a bad example. \u201cIt is unacceptable for the finance minister not to be able to prove the origins of his property, especially since he is a member of a government that has built its program on a fight against tax evasion,\u201d Mr. Sobotka said at the news conference. \u201cIt is impossible for the government to chase small entrepreneurs when a billionaire is evading taxes.\u201d Mr. Sobotka said it was a difficult decision. \u201cIf I ask the finance minister to resign I might turn him into a martyr in the upcoming months,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cHe has been preparing for that role for the past few days already. I chose the only possible decision.\u201d Petr Fiala, the head of the center-right opposition Civic Democratic Party, ridiculed Mr. Sobotka\u2019s logic, calling it an example of \u201ccluelessness.\u201d He predicted that Mr. Sobotka would not be able to form a governing coalition without Mr. Babis\u2019s support. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s decision is a continuation of an absurd political theater that we have been witnessing for a few months now,\u201d Mr. Fiala said in an interview. \u201cOne has to wonder how the prime minister plans to negotiate with the current coalition parties \u2014 that is with Andej Babis, as well \u2014 about a new government without Andrej Babis.\u201d Mr. Babis, for his part, said he was stunned by the decision. \u201cThe prime minister just destroyed one of the most successful governments since the Velvet Revolution,\u201d he said in a statement, referring to the nonviolent demonstrations in 1989 that eventually toppled one-party Communist rule in what was then Czechoslovakia. Mr. Babis said he had sent a letter to Mr. Sobotka explaining that he had complied with all tax laws. \u201cMr. Sobotka has never run any business of his own, so I understand it is difficult for him to comprehend the letter I sent,\u201d Mr. Babis said. The Czech Republic joined the European Union in 2004, and has experienced rapid economic growth, It also has one of the lowest unemployment rates of the 28 nations in the bloc. The Czech currency, the crown, dipped slightly on Tuesday against the euro following news of the resignations, but quickly recovered. Analysts said that Mr. Sobotka might have made a shrewd decision by distancing himself from Mr. Bibis. \u201cIt was a very good move of Sobotka that will free his hands for the election campaign, allow him to stand up against Babis and allow him to claim that he is not clinging to power,\u201d said Stanislav Balik, the head of the political science department at Masaryk University in Brno, the second-largest Czech city, after Prague. \u201cThe big unknown now is the president. Who will he give power to?\u201d Mr. Zeman, who said through a spokesman that he had no immediate comment, could reject the resignations and insist that the current cabinet stay on until the elections. Or he could ask someone other than Mr. Sobotka to try to form a caretaker government. (Mr. Babis said on Tuesday that he had no interest in doing so.) \u201cWe might have new government next week, or we might have to wait for five more months,\u201d Mr. Balik said, referring to the autumn elections.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/europe/czech-republic-sobotka-resignation.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T11:33:21-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T11:33:21-04:00", "abstract": "Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said he could not work with his finance minister, the populist billionaire Andrej Babis.", "title": "Czech Leader, in Power Struggle With Rival, Offers Resignation"}
