{"text": "The Mexican actor and comedian Eugenio Derbez is a superstar in his own country and in Hispanic communities in the United States, but he is virtually unknown to non-Hispanic viewers. (He has been seen, in small roles, in the likes of \u201cBeverly Hills Chihuahua\u201d and Adam Sandler\u2019s \u201cJack and Jill,\u201d neither exactly a star-making vehicle.) \u201cHow to Be a Latin Lover,\u201d which bids to introduce him to a wider audience in the United States, is surprisingly deft in mixing Mr. Derbez\u2019s broad but accomplished style with more ostensibly hip-absurdist Anglo modes of humor. Body-function jokes are, of course, a universal comedic language, and they\u2019re here, too, although not as abundant as you might have expected. After an ostentatiously absurd and morbid origin story, in which two scrappy Mexican kids lose their dad in an explosive truck mishap, we then see one of those kids, Maximo, as a young man in his prime, seducing a considerably older grocery store heiress at a hotel pool. Twenty-five years later he and the woman are that much older, and Maximo, now played by a paunchy Mr. Derbez, is so thoroughly pampered that when he goes golfing, he putts while supine in his cart. But after she is seduced anew by an unctuous Lamborghini salesman, played by a very against-type Michael Cera, Maximo is out the door without a cent. \u201cYou signed a prenuptial agreement,\u201d his soon-to-be-ex reminds him. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t, I signed a prenup,\u201d Maximo shoots back, and then pauses. \u201cOh \u2026\u201d he says, as it hits him. \u201cHow to Be a Latin Lover\u201d is directed by the comic actor Ken Marino (known for his work on the TV show \u201cThe State\u201d and in the likes of \u201cWet Hot American Summer,\u201d here making his feature directorial debut) from a script by Chris Spain and Jon Zack. When it sticks to exchanges like the one above, it plays a little like a vintage Bob Hope picture with a dirty mind. Once Maximo settles in for some exposure to real life in the home of his estranged sister, Sara (Salma Hayek, very sweet when she\u2019s not playing angry), and her son, Hugo, the balancing act of sentiment and asininity proves more difficult for the filmmakers. And, of course, the movie\u2019s theme of gigolo-dom provides many opportunities for sexist, ageist and lookist humor, all of which \u201cLatin Lover\u201d takes with regularity. However, the whole enterprise is so fundamentally good-natured and fluffy that it\u2019s sometimes hard to stay annoyed by it. Rob Lowe\u2019s dryly dopey comedic presence as another gold digger is an asset. So is Raphael Alejandro as Hugo, who\u2019s sweet and winsome and precocious without being cloying. For some reason, the actor John Heard shows up; he is seen crossing the street in a shot, never to return. It\u2019s the only enigmatic feature of this goofball exercise.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/movies/how-to-be-a-latin-lover-review-eugenio-derbez.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T16:17:41-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T16:17:41-04:00", "abstract": "In this good-natured comedy, the Mexican actor and comedian has been dumped and has to settle for real life.", "title": "Review: Eugenio Derbez as Just a Gigolo in \u2018How to Be a Latin Lover\u2019"}
