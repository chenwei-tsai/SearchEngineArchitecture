{"text": "Sebastian Gorka, a West Wing adviser to President Trump who has become a flash point for controversy, is likely to be moved out of the White House in the coming weeks for a different role in the administration, two senior administration officials said Sunday. It was not immediately clear where Mr. Gorka, an adviser on national security, would be headed. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said only that there was nothing to announce about Mr. Gorka at this time. His anticipated departure was reported earlier by The Daily Beast and The Washington Examiner. Mr. Gorka, a former editor at Breitbart News, a right-wing website, is a friend of Stephen K. Bannon, the onetime Breitbart chairman who is now Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist. Mr. Gorka memorably declared that \u201cthe alpha males are back\u201d as an assertion of the distance between the Obama administration and the current one. He has been accused of having links to far-right groups in Europe, and critics of his hard-line views on Islam have accused him of Islamophobia. Mr. Gorka, a vocal defender of the administration\u2019s efforts to temporarily ban travel from some predominantly Muslim countries, has said violence is a fundamental part of Islam and emanates from the language of the Quran. He rejects scholars\u2019 assessment that Islamic militancy is an outgrowth of poverty, poor governance and war.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/politics/sebastian-gorka-white-house.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T21:37:13-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T21:37:13-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Gorka, an adviser on national security who has attracted criticism for his links to far-right groups and his hard-line views on Islam, is to take on another administration role.", "title": "Sebastian Gorka Likely to Be Out of White House Role, Officials Say"}
