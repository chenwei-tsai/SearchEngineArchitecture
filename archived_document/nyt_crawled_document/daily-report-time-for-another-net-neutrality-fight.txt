{"text": "Remember when it seemed as though Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, was seeking the tech industry\u2019s input on changes to the so-called net neutrality rules? Perhaps he did not listen very carefully to what they had to say. On Wednesday, Mr. Pai outlined a plan to loosen the government\u2019s oversight of high-speed internet providers. The heart of that oversight has been the concept of net neutrality. Support for the principle spurred, among other F.C.C. actions, the classification of broadband as a common carrier service like telephones, which are subject to strong government oversight. It was perhaps the signature telecommunications decision of the Obama administration, and one with considerable support in the technology industry. But as Cecilia Kang writes, Mr. Pai has long thought those rules were a hindrance, and he voted against them as a member of the F.C.C. before he became its chairman. \u201cIt\u2019s basic economics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you\u2019re likely to get.\u201d Mr. Pai was vague on the details of his plan, but he said he generally supports the ideas behind net neutrality. The Obama-era rules, he said, went too far.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/technology/daily-report-time-for-another-net-neutrality-fight.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Technology", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T13:31:11-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T13:31:11-04:00", "abstract": "The F.C.C.\u2019s chairman said high-speed internet access should no longer be regulated like a utility, reversing an Obama administration initiative.", "title": "Daily Report: Time For Another Net Neutrality Fight"}
