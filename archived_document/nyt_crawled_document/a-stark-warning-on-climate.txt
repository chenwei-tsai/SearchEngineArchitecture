{"text": "To the Editor: Bill McKibben\u2019s message in \u201cThe Planet Doesn\u2019t Have Time for This\u201d (Sunday Review, April 23) is profound and represents a stark warning to all who ignore it. While the many pressing issues of our time \u2014 health care, Brexit, North Korea, tax cuts, the list goes on \u2014 can be quickly reversed by calm negotiations and wise decisions, the physics of climate change cannot. We can\u2019t instantly remove the carbon dioxide we are pouring into the atmosphere, cool and de-acidify the oceans, or refreeze the polar regions. We are creating conditions that will persist for eons, and the consequences will be catastrophic. When will we recognize the urgency before us? While we dismiss the increase in tornadoes, hailstorms and forest fires as \u201cweather events\u201d and ignore the inexorable rise in sea levels, they serve as nature\u2019s gentle but persistent warning of the cataclysm that awaits us. For our children\u2019s sake, we had better wake up and change course soon. WILLIAM L.
