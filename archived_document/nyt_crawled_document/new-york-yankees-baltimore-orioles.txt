{"text": "Friday\u2019s game between the Yankees and Orioles ended, fittingly enough, on a home run. Saturday\u2019s started, rather shockingly, the same way. That is not because the home run is a rare occurrence at Yankee Stadium these days. An inordinate number of baseballs have landed beyond the outfield fence there this weekend. Most of them are being hit by the home team, for whom the nickname Bronx Bombers once again seems to fit. The shock value on Saturday came from the identity of the game\u2019s leading slugger: Brett Gardner, who had not hit a ball out of any park since last July 30. The Yankees hit five home runs Friday night in a stunning 14-11 win over the Baltimore Orioles, a game in which the Yankees trailed, 9-1, after the top of the sixth inning. That game ended on a three-run homer by Matt Holliday, a designated hitter by trade and the brawny type of guy who gets paid to hit home runs. On Saturday Gardner, a speedster who is generously listed at 5 feet 11 and 195 pounds, belted Ubaldo Jimenez\u2019s second pitch of the game into the second deck of the right-field seats to give the Yankees a 1-0 lead. An inning later, Gardner drove another Jimenez fastball into the Yankees\u2019 bullpen with two runners on base to extend the lead to 5-0. Austin Romine added a two-run homer in the sixth inning, and Aaron Judge hit a two-run shot, his 10th home run of this young season, and the Yankees won, 12-4, to extend their winning streak to four games and take a one-game lead over Baltimore in the American League East. Starting pitcher Michael Pineda (3-1) ran up a high pitch count but allowed just two unearned runs on five hits, striking out eight. The Orioles added two ninth-inning runs on a homer by Caleb Joseph off Tommy Layne. Gardner had not led off a game with a home run in nearly three years, and had gone 261 at-bats, roughly half a season, without hitting any ball out of the park. His last multihomer game came on Sept. 12, 2015, and his last leadoff home run on Aug. 31, 2014. After he started well this season, with six hits in his first 16 at-bats, things had gone downhill for Gardner, the longest-tenured position player on the Yankees\u2019 roster and, at 33, the second-oldest player in their everyday lineup. In the 14 games he played after April 7, Gardner had managed just six hits in 48 at-bats. His batting average plummeted from .375 to .188, his on-base percentage from .444 to .316. He had not driven in a single run before Saturday\u2019s game. But when he came to the plate for his third at-bat, with a 7-0 Yankees lead, the same ballpark that had echoed with boos after his strikeout in the eighth inning of Friday night\u2019s game was filled with cheers. Even after Gardner struck out, there was polite applause as he headed to the dugout. Gardner, who makes his living with his legs and his glove \u2014 he won a Gold Glove for his play in left field in 2016 \u2014 flirted with being a power hitter in 2014, when he hit 17 home runs, and in 2015, when he hit 16. But he hit only seven last year, and over the first 21 games of this season seemed unlikely to match even that total in 2017. But the home run has returned to prominence in the Yankees\u2019 offense this season; they lead the A.L. with 36. Some have come from the usual sources, and some from the least likely. Inside Pitch Aaron Judge\u2019s seventh-inning home run tied the major league record for most homers by a rookie in April. \u2026 Austin Romine became the first Yankees\u2019 No. 9 hitter to drive in five or more runs in a game in nearly 18 years. The last was Joe Girardi, who drove in seven runs against the Texas Rangers on Aug. 23, 1999. Romine\u2019s tenure as the everyday catcher is nearly at an end, however; Gary Sanchez practiced throwing to the bases for the first time since incurring a biceps strain on April 8, and he will start a rehabilitation assignment on Tuesday with Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/sports/baseball/new-york-yankees-baltimore-orioles.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T17:25:09-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T17:25:09-04:00", "abstract": "Gardner, who had not hit a home run since last July, delivered two on Saturday as the Yankees took a one-game lead in the American League East.", "title": "Brett Gardner\u2019s Sudden Power Surge Carries the Yankees Past the Orioles"}
