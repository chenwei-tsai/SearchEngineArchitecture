{"text": "Randy Fenoli, above, a cable television show personality and wedding-dress guru, has helped scores of women say \u201cyes\u201d before they do so at the altar. Now he has designed his own line of wedding gowns, which he presented last week to a standing-room-only crowd at Kleinfeld Bridal during Bridal Fashion Week in New York. \u201cI wanted to give brides a dress that looks and feels couture,\u201d Mr. Fenoli said, \u201cwith impeccable fit, at a price point that is more affordable.\u201d His 25-dress collection includes ethereal styles and others that are simple and almost architectural. Many are priced under $2,000 and none over $3,500. This season, in fact, there is a wide range for brides-to-be whose budgets top out at $2,000. \u201cThe average price, the sweet spot for most brides in the United States for a wedding dress, is $900 to $1,400,\u201d said the design director Madeline Gardner, an owner of Morilee, a company that manufactures many of the bridal dresses sold worldwide. \u201cThe difference between a couture gown and the others is the fit,\u201d she said. \u201cA couture gown is made to the measurements of each individual while other gowns are made in standard sizes and then altered to fit the customer.\u201d Some trends Ms. Gardner identified for the coming season include a return to tulle ball gowns, a lot of lace, and sheer midriffs and backs. Sleeves, many sheer, were also popular. \u201cI\u2019m seeing three-dimensional embroidery and flowers, and lots of color, from black to blush, in trims and linings,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of romance in the shapes this spring, and I love that.\u201d 1. Mr. Fenoli\u2019s new line includes Celine, left, a slim unembellished dress with overlapping layers of organza that he said will flutter in the wind at an outdoor wedding; $1,705. 2.
