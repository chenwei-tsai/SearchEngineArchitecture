{"text": "\u201cNatasha\u201d is about as twisted and uncomfortable a coming-of-age film as you\u2019re likely to find, with a startlingly manipulative teenager, the title character, at its center. The story, written and directed by David Bezmozgis based on his own book, is set among the Russian immigrant population in the suburbs of Toronto, where a 16-year-old, Mark (Alex Ozerov of \u201cThe Americans\u201d), delivers drugs for a local dealer while his clueless parents (Deanna Dezmari and Genadijs Dolganovs) nag him to get a job. Mark\u2019s summer is disrupted, to say the least, when an uncle imports a bride (Aya-Tatyana Stolnits) from Russia. She arrives with her 14-year-old daughter, Natasha (Sasha K. Gordon, whose performance makes this film). Natasha speaks no English, hates her mother and is resentful about having been uprooted. Mark is assigned to show the morose girl around. She begins to thaw, then turns white hot, first revealing to Mark an ugly past that included having been used by a pornographer, then seducing him. Natasha is utterly emotionless about sex, using it as a weapon, but she also can adjust her personality to seem like any other shy, vulnerable teenager. Mr. Bezmozgis creates a disturbing portrait of a girl turned calculating and nihilistic by her upbringing, and there is no coyness here. If the sight of 14-year-old and 16-year-old characters having R-rated sex seems troubling, this stark, unsettling movie isn\u2019t for you.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/natasha-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:15:33-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:15:33-04:00", "abstract": "When a morose Russian teenager comes to town, a 16-year-old in the Toronto suburbs meets his match.", "title": "Review: In the Disturbing \u2018Natasha,\u2019 Sex and Manipulation"}
