{"text": "\u201cBandstand,\u201d an openhearted, indecisive new musical, wants you clapping your hands and clenching your fists, tapping your toes and blinking back tears. It is both a peppy celebration of can-do spirit and a more somber exploration of what American servicemen experienced when they marched home from World War II. Directed and choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler, the Tony Award-winning choreographer of \u201cHamilton,\u201d with book and lyrics by the Broadway newcomers Richard Oberacker and Rob Taylor, and a 1940s pastiche score by Mr. Oberacker, \u201cBandstand\u201d is an undercooked slice of apple pie, served with a dollop of anguish. Pfc. Donny Novitski (Corey Cott) saw action in the Solomon Islands and saw hell on Bougainville. Back home in Cleveland in 1945, he wants to pick up life just where he let it fall. Big dreams for a guy who can\u2019t even sleep through the night. A hunky pianist with restless fingers and floppy hair, Donny can\u2019t book gigs at the nightclubs he used to play, as their piano benches are now filled with new talent, mostly men who didn\u2019t serve. Haunted by a bad conscience and tempted by the bottle, he gets a reprieve when he hears about a Tribute to the Troops! contest. Bands from all 50 states will compete to write and perform the next great swing song \u201cin honor of our boys in uniform.\u201d First, Donny has to put together a group, which he does in the lilting, satisfying \u201cI Know a Guy.\u201d His lineup: bass, drums, trumpet, trombone, sax \u2014 with a twist. As Donny sings, \u201cEvery horn and clarinet/Will be a military vet.\u201d All of the musicians he recruits have served. Not one came through the war unscathed. Which means they can really cook. And ache. And seethe. And they do. In the style of recent revivals of \u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d the versatile actors play their instruments live, with the rest of the orchestra hidden in the pit. (Bill Elliott and Greg Anthony Rassen did the lively orchestrations.) This corps has chops, but it doesn\u2019t have a hit, not until Donny meets Julia Trojan (Laura Osnes), the widow of his war buddy, nicknamed Rubber. Turns out she\u2019s a singer and a poet and conveniently a knockout. Now the band has a vocalist and a song: \u201cLove Will Come and Find Me Again,\u201d a bluesy tune about getting ready to date when your man is among the war dead. That no one wonders if this is the ideal tune to honor the troops is one of the piece\u2019s head-scratchers. Here\u2019s another: What is \u201cBandstand\u201d truly about? Wartime musicals are a tricky business. From \u201cOn the Town\u201d to \u201cSouth Pacific\u201d to \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d they all have to balance martial reality with theatrical flair. Here, the push is toward \u201clet\u2019s put on a show\u201d jollity, shadowed by a more somber impulse to examine what it means to come home half-broken. This gloomier inclination is more compelling; there\u2019s a wrenching number toward the end of the first act when Mr. Blankenbuehler uses dance, in \u201cRight This Way,\u201d to suggest the psychological burdens these men carry. As each band member tries to move through space, he finds himself dragged down by dancers playing fallen comrades. It\u2019s a symbolic gesture that hits like a gut punch and a great argument for why theater can sometimes tell a story more boldly and more viscerally than a movie or a television show. Yet \u201cBandstand\u201d can\u2019t sustain this solemnity. It\u2019s respectful of veterans, but not of itself, ultimately quitting on its own ambitions \u2014 a theatrical case of soldier\u2019s heart. The script never fleshes out the members of the backing band, and in the second act \u2014 with the exception of a defiant, devastating and somewhat unlikely 11 o\u2019clock number (\u201cWelcome Home\u201d) \u2014 the show trades real and probably unresolvable conflict for familiar clashes between love and fear, art and business. Romance, record sales and a savvy contracts lawyer can fix trauma? Someone tell the V.A. A veneer of seriousness cuts down on the fun. The set, designed by David Korins, feels deliberately cramped; the lighting, by Jeff Croiter, is often sepulchral; and the cheerier numbers \u2014 like \u201cFirst Steps First\u201d and \u201cYou Deserve It\u201d \u2014 sound a lot more formulaic than the darker ones. (The resolutely goofy \u201cI Got a Theory,\u201d an ode to Cleveland, is an odd exception.) A swing band exists to set the crowd jumping and jiving, but while Mr. Blankenbuehler capitalizes on the period\u2019s shoulder shrugs and swiveling hips, big dance numbers are few, short and subdued. Swing borrows its beat from African-American musical styles, as Mr. Blankenbuehler acknowledged in a recent interview, and more than a million African-Americans served in World War II. But you won\u2019t find those musicians or fighters here. In some ways, that\u2019s fair. Music and combat weren\u2019t typically integrated at the time. Bringing in a significant African-American character might have derailed the narrative that Mr. Taylor and Mr. Oberacker constructed. (So might the inclusion of a woman who did more during the war than languish and work at a cosmetics counter.) But that they found no way to acknowledge these contributions, except for a throwaway line about Duke Ellington, feels like a missed opportunity. At \u201cHamilton,\u201d Mr. Blankenbuehler learned how diverse casting can galvanize familiar stories. He and the producing team fail to apply that lesson to this show, even the ensemble. Still, you can\u2019t fault the casting of the leads. Mr. Cott, whom we last saw squatting on a park bench in the misbegotten \u201cGigi\u201d revival, has a crushing charisma and a sob-in-the-throat song style that makes the haunted, arrogant Donny mighty endearing. Mr. Cott even makes high-waisted pants seem plausible. (The nifty costumes are by Paloma Young.) Ms. Osnes, a brunette with a silvery voice, puts real feeling behind Julia\u2019s loss. The expert Beth Leavel nails the underwritten role of Julia\u2019s pragmatic mother. But even fine actors can\u2019t make this story more persuasive. If \u201cBandstand\u201d really worked, the finale would find you laughing and crying. Instead, you might just make like the dancers and shrug.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/theater/bandstand-review-broadway.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T22:00:31-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-26T22:00:31-04:00", "abstract": "Laura Osnes and Corey Cott star in a new Broadway musical, set in 1945, about a musician, a singer, trauma and healing.", "title": "Review: Singing and Dancing the Postwar Blues in \u2018Bandstand\u2019"}
