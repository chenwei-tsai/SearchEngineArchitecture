{"text": "John Waters Age 71 Occupation Film director and writer, most recently of \u201cMake Trouble\u201d (Algonquin) Location Baltimore His Favorite Room Mr. Waters lives in a 1927 Italianate-style house that he admired as a boy and later bought because, he said, \u201cit looked like Dracula\u2019s house.\u201d His second-floor writer\u2019s room is filled with pop-culture ephemera: a bottle of Tylenol from an infamous 1982 recalled batch; old props from his movies; an autographed tube of Justin Bieber-endorsed acne cream. \u201cThey\u2019re like relics,\u201d Mr. Waters said. \u201cLike religious items that you keep.\u201d What\u2019s your writing routine? Every morning, Monday to Friday, I get up at 6 a.m., and I read six or seven newspapers, look at my email and come here at exactly 8 o\u2019clock. Everyone in the world that I know knows don\u2019t call here, don\u2019t email, I\u2019m not going to answer. And then in the afternoon, I go in that room and sell the ideas. Is eating a bowl of oatmeal part of the daily process? This is fake. I collect fake food. I don\u2019t eat when I\u2019m writing. I think it can lead to writer\u2019s block if you eat a lot. What object from this heap of bric-a-brac most inspires you? This great Grace Metalious figurine. Can you believe they sell this? She wrote \u201cPeyton Place.\u201d And she wrote \u201cReturn to Peyton Place\u201d and \u201cThe Tight White Collar\u201d and \u201cNo Adam in Eden.\u201d That was her complete works. Then she got hugely successful and drank a lot and died. I loved her. Why? \u201cPeyton Place\u201d was the first dirty book I read. And she scandalized the nation, right? \u201cMake Trouble\u201d is your reprinted speech to the graduating students of Rhode Island School of Design. Any advice for young artists about setting up a home? I think it\u2019s very important to have a trash can from a writer you like. I tried to buy Ingmar Bergman\u2019s trash can at his auction, but it went for too much. This trash can is Patrick White\u2019s, the novelist. So my bad ideas go in the same place that Patrick White\u2019s bad ideas went in. That way you don\u2019t feel bad. You roll it up, throw it in and go, \u201cSo did Patrick White.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/fashion/john-waterss-writing-room-in-baltimore-full-of-kitsch.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T17:50:35-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T17:50:35-04:00", "abstract": "The film director and writer lives in a 1927 Italianate-style house.
