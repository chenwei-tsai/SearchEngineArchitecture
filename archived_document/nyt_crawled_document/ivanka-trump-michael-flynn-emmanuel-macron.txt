Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here\u2019s the latest. 1. Here\u2019s a short scorecard for the Trump administration\u2019s day. On the plus side: The president dropped his demand for immediate funds for a border wall, easing the passage of a spending bill by Friday to avert a government shutdown. Financial markets soared on reports that Mr. Trump aims to cut corporate taxes. The Nasdaq passed 6,000 for the first time. And Mr. Trump spoke forcefully at a Holocaust remembrance ceremony, a possible reset of his relations with the Jewish community. _____ 2. Now, the dings: A federal judge blocked the administration from cutting funds for \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d Lawmakers from both parties said Michael Flynn, the president\u2019s first national security adviser, may have violated the law by not disclosing his business dealings with Russia. And Ivanka Trump drew hisses at a conference in Berlin when she defended her father\u2019s treatment of women and called him a \u201ctremendous champion\u201d of families. There\u2019s more on the border wall and the budget in our Daily podcast and in our latest edition of Right and Left: Partisan Writing You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. _____ 3. France honored Xavier Jugel\u00e9, the police officer killed in the attack on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es last week. His partner, above, gave a moving eulogy. The two presidential candidates, Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, attended the ceremony at Paris police headquarters. Our Interpreter columnists came up with an interesting analogy for Western populism: entering its awkward teenage years, meaning able to have an influence on the household but too young to run it. _____ 4. North Korea\u2019s decision to hold only artillery drills for national celebrations, not a nuclear test, did not end fears of a military confrontation. The U.S. strengthened its show of force, adding a submarine armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles to the naval exercises it\u2019s conducting with South Korea. North Korea is holding three U.S. citizens. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are scheduled to brief the entire Senate on North Korea at the White House on Wednesday. _____ 5. We visited Flint, Michigan, where the water\u2019s supposed to be safe now, but poverty and violence persist. The city\u2019s long-standing problems have grown worse because of the tainted water crisis, which poisoned residents and eroded the city\u2019s reputation and property values. \u201cI feel like Flint is falling,\u201d said Anthony Johnson, above. \u201cIt just keeps on falling.\u201d _____ 6. Today\u2019s energy jobs are in solar, not coal. Solar has more jobs across the country, and the relatively new industry continues to add capacity. Above, a solar power-generating site in Nevada. And a new report found that nearly half of the nation\u2019s largest corporations have set their own emissions reduction targets \u2014 even as the government moves away from them. _____ 7. The yogurt maker Chobani filed a lawsuit against the radio host Alex Jones, above, and the site Infowars for posting what it called false reports about the company and its owner. Hamdi Ulukaya, the founder of Chobani, has been a target of threats from right-wingers who say he employs too many refugees. Reports on InfoWars alleged that the company\u2019s factory in Idaho was connected to a 2016 child sexual assault and a rise in tuberculosis cases. _____ 8. The 111-year-old Matthews Opera House is one of the South Dakota institutions that depends on the National Endowment for the Arts. Above, its cast rehearsed for \u201cHamlet.\u201d The state voted largely for Trump, but it\u2019s a prime recipient of arts funding that he wants to eliminate. \u201cAs much as the people here like this, I\u2019m not sure they would see it if it cost $80,\u201d one theatergoer said. _____  9. In Indonesia, a palm oil company responsible for rain forest destruction helped purchase part of an island in Borneo for an orangutan sanctuary. That enabled at least 200 animals \u2014 all refugees of development \u2014 to be freed. But it also left environmentalists queasy about providing a cloak of respectability to a company that destroys orangutan habitats. _____ 10. Finally, embrace your failures. That\u2019s the ethos of the Museum of Failure, which will open in Sweden in June. The museum will showcase products that flopped, like the Rejuvenique mask, above, which was marketed as a facial toning system \u2014 all to prove that innovation requires failure. Have a great night. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.
