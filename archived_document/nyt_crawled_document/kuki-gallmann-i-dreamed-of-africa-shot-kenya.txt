Mrs. Gallmann, 73, who was hit in the hip and stomach area, was being airlifted to Nairobi for treatment, her family said. She had been riding in a vehicle on her ranch with Kenyan wildlife rangers when she was attacked, and the bullet flew through the door, hitting her. \u201cThis is horrendous for Kenya and horrendous for her,\u201d said Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a close friend and a well-known expert on elephant behavior. For the past several weeks, waves of armed pastoralists have invaded her ranch in northern Kenya, part of a wider problem in which many farmers in the area have been terrorized. Thousands of pastoralists from other parts of the country have swept into farms, burning down houses and chasing away residents, despite the Kenyan military and police services deploying forces to push the invaders out. Mrs. Gallmann, a passionate, Italian-born conservationist who has been living in Kenya for decades, has been attacked several times before. Earlier this month, raiders burned down one of her most beloved retreats on her property, which had been a favorite place of her now-dead son. In the past several days, the violence seemed to be drawing a tighter ring around her. \u201cPokot militia openly carrying firearms,\u201d she wrote in a text message to me on April 15. (The Pokot are an ethnic group in northern Kenya.) \u201cNot just herders. Group of armed men without livestock. 13 firearm spotted.\u201d On April 17, she sent another message: \u201c2 Arsons by herders and shooting reported.\u201d She added, \u201cFire ongoing.\u201d After the shooting on Sunday, she was still conscious and speaking, her family said. The attack happened around 9 a.m., and by 1 p.m., she was undergoing surgery at a Nairobi hospital. Mrs. Gallmann\u2019s friends said that a combat-trained field medic from a nearby British military base had helped stabilize her and had arranged to take her helicopter by to the Nairobi hospital. Mrs. Gallmann\u2019s vast ranch is in Laikipia, a highland plateau north of Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi. Herders from pastoralist communities, including the Pokot, have harassed Laikipia farmers for years, saying they need more land to graze their animals. This year, the violence has reached unprecedented levels. Invading herdsmen shot and killed a British rancher in March and have continued to burn down houses and shoot at farmers and police officers. The Kenyan security services have deployed hundreds of officers, including some based on Mrs. Gallmann\u2019s ranch, with a Humvee parked in her front yard. But Kenya\u2019s government is increasingly distracted by national elections scheduled for August. Just this past week, violence broke out across the country during primaries, a worrying sign for many Kenyans who already dread the elections because they often stir up ethnic tensions and lead to bloodshed in the country.", "published_date": "2017-04-22T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World"}
