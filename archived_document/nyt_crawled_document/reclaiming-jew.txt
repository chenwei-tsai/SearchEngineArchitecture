{"abstract": "We\u2019re not just Jewish. We\u2019re also the noun.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Jew\u2019 is a funny word,\u201d the comedian Louis C. K. once said, \u201cbecause \u2018Jew\u2019 is the only word that is the polite thing to call a group of people and the slur for the same group.\u201d I was reminded of these wise words on April 14, halfway through Passover and two days before Easter, when President Trump gave a short speech recognizing the two holidays. As far as Trump speeches go, it was pretty decent, a short bit of hortatory boilerplate with Trumpian flourishes, like calling the Exodus the story of \u201can incredible people.\u201d He did not attack immigrants, or journalists, or Pope Francis, and he gave equal time to the two holidays, which was reassuring. But Mr. Trump\u2019s speech bothered me nonetheless, because he fell into a common linguistic habit that most Americans, even most Jews, surely didn\u2019t notice. While the word \u201cJewish\u201d appeared in the speech, Mr. Trump neglected to mention \u201cJews.\u201d In his remarks, it was \u201cChristians\u201d who celebrated Holy Week and the resurrection of Christ \u2014 but it was \u201cJewish families\u201d who celebrated Passover and \u201cthe Jewish people\u201d who survived a long history of persecution. There were \u201cChristians\u201d \u2014 people with their own noun \u2014 and there were \u201cJewish\u201d people \u2014 collectives described by an adjective. The shift from the noun to the adjective was most jarring near the end of the speech, when Mr. Trump prayed for an age in which \u201cgood people of all faiths, Christians and Muslims and Jewish and Hindu, can follow their hearts and worship according to their conscience.\u201d This verbal tic is not unique to Mr. Trump. In his first Passover statement, in 1981, President Ronald Reagan extended \u201cwarmest wishes\u201d to \u201cJewish people everywhere.\u201d In President Obama\u2019s last Passover message, he mentioned \u201cJewish families\u201d twice but \u201cJews\u201d never. There is, in fact, a widespread hesitation to describe Jews as Jews. In 2000, in the aftermath of Al Gore\u2019s popular-vote victory in the presidential election, a well-meaning editor forced me to rewrite a sentence in an essay about Joseph Lieberman, the vice-presidential nominee. I had written that Americans had, in effect, \u201celected a Jew as vice president,\u201d but the editor \u2014 a non-Jew \u2014 made me change the wording to \u201ca Jewish vice president.\u201d He knew that to write \u201ca Jew,\u201d even in a positive article by a Jewish reporter, would strike some as offensive. We Jews, too, recoil from calling ourselves Jews. In my experience as an editor at a publication focusing on Jewish news and culture, and hosting its podcast about Jewish life, I have noticed how many Jewish writers \u2014 me included \u2014 avoid calling anyone a \u201cJew.\u201d I frequently edit articles that mention \u201cJewish politicians\u201d or \u201cJewish artists\u201d but not \u201cJews.\u201d Like our non-Jewish friends, we Jews have been conditioned to think of a \u201cJew\u201d as something bad. We will say, \u201cSome really nice Jewish people moved in next door,\u201d rather than, \u201cSome really nice Jews moved in next door.\u201d Trying to discern if someone is suitable dating material for a single, religious friend, we\u2019ll ask, \u201cOh, is he Jewish?\u201d but not, \u201cOh, is he a Jew?\u201d To be \u201ca real Christian\u201d is a compliment, but to be \u201ca real Jew\u201d is considered an insult. \u201cA real Jew\u201d may be stingy, crass or pushy \u2014 whatever she is, it\u2019s not good. There are understandable reasons one might prefer the phrase \u201cJewish person\u201d to \u201cJew.\u201d For one thing, anti-Semites love to talk about \u201cJews\u201d and \u201cthe Jews.\u201d The noun has been a slur in English since the 17th century, and to the Jew-haters of the world, Jew-ness, with all the genetically heritable perfidy it entails, is an essential and ineradicable trait. Whether it\u2019s the stain of having murdered Jesus or an inborn capacity for greed or deception, the vices perceived by the anti-Semite belong to \u201cthe Jew,\u201d not someone who happens to be Jewish. Anti-Semites have made \u201cJew\u201d a term of opprobrium, and the rest of us have acquiesced. But there\u2019s another reason Jews prefer \u201cJewish.\u201d Many of us don\u2019t think of Jew-ness as central to our identity. If what we\u2019re talking about is an ethnic inheritance, but not one that defines us in an important way, we may rightly feel that \u201cJewish\u201d makes a more modest, weaker claim than \u201cJew\u201d \u2014 just as \u201cI\u2019m German\u201d sounds a bit milder than \u201cI\u2019m a German.\u201d The former is purely descriptive, the latter a bit proud. It\u2019s precisely because \u201cJew\u201d is a bit proud that I want Jews to use it more. Jews, like other minority or marginalized groups, are entitled to a noun to call our own. Such a word will have as many meanings as there are people who claim it, but no matter. When asked by somebody scrutinizing our last name or facial features, \u201cWhat\u2019s your heritage?\u201d we should be able to answer, with whatever meaning we impart to it, \u201cI\u2019m a Jew.\u201d For most of us, speaking such a sentence would feel odd, even scary. But it doesn\u2019t have to. It shouldn\u2019t. As Cynthia M. Baker points out in \u201cJew,\u201d her book about the word, Jews have \u201cnot, in fact, owned the word \u2018Jew\u2019 or controlled the discourse about it \u2014 or even much used the term \u2014 for most of the past 2,000 years.\u201d It was Christians who talked about \u201cJews,\u201d while our preferred term for ourselves was \u201cIsraelite\u201d or \u201cHebrew.\u201d But those terms are now antiquated, and unlikely to be revived in that form: The founding of the State of Israel and the rebirth of the Hebrew language have given those words other connotations. So it\u2019s time for us to own \u201cJew.\u201d We can do so by using the word more ourselves, and by giving everyone else permission to call Jews Jews. We can rescue, as Louis C. K. would say, the \u201cpolite thing\u201d from the slur. Jews are what we are, after all, and the anti-Semites shouldn\u2019t be the only ones saying so.", "section": "Opinion", "title": "Reclaiming \u2018Jew\u2019", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/opinion/reclaiming-jew.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T14:30:14-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T14:30:14-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "item_type": "Article"}
