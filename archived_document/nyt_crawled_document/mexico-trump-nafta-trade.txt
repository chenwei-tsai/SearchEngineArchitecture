{"text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 There was a time when Donald J. Trump \u2014 first as a candidate and then as president \u2014 could rile Mexico without really trying. His threats to build a border wall and make Mexicans pay for it would ignite firestorms of patriotic fury and resentment. His promises to deport millions of undocumented immigrants would send politicians to draft contingency plans. His vows to re-engineer the North American Free Trade Agreement and bring Mexico to heel would shake the foundations of the state. But on Wednesday, the suggestion from the White House that Mr. Trump was finalizing an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the United States from Nafta revealed a different, more experienced Mexico, one that was learning to live with what it considers Mr. Trump\u2019s bluster and stagecraft \u2014 and not inclined to publicly react too quickly. \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s sitting at a poker table bluffing rather than making serious decisions,\u201d said Senator Armando R\u00edos Piter, a Mexican legislator. \u201cIn front of a bluffer, you always have to maintain a firm and dignified position.\u201d Mexican officials did not publicly comment until after Mr. Trump issued a statement, late on Wednesday night, that he was not seeking to withdraw from Nafta, but instead \u201cto bring Nafta up to date through renegotiation.\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he had agreed to pleas by President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada that he not pull out of the treaty immediately. He had also come under pressure from congressional Republicans and business leaders alarmed by the possibility that Mr. Trump would move hastily toward a withdrawal. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto also issued a brief statement of his own, saying that the presidents spoke about \u201cthe shared objective to modernize\u201d the trade agreement. The day\u2019s vicissitudes left many Mexicans with a bit of whiplash \u2014 the Mexican peso took a nose-dive \u2014 but also with a mild sense of satisfaction that they were finally learning to read the American president. Eduardo Bravo, past chairman of the Mexican Entrepreneur Association, said he felt relieved by the way the issue was resolved on Wednesday, but warned that there was still a rough road ahead, describing the White House behavior as \u201cvery schizophrenic.\u201d \u201cReally, you have to maintain hope and keep working to maintain the relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201d In interviews with politicians, analysts, economists, business leaders and former diplomats, a general sentiment had emerged throughout the day on Wednesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to withdraw from the treaty using an executive order would mostly be a piece of political theater aimed as much at his voting base as at Mexico and Canada, and not something to get terribly worked up about. Some speculated that the news of the order was a controlled leak intended to gauge the reaction of the other Nafta parties and put them on the defensive. \u201cThe generous analysis would be that he\u2019s playing brinkmanship and trying to up the ante,\u201d said Arturo Sarukh\u00e1n, a former Mexican diplomat to the United States. \u201cThis is a way to sort of rattle the scabbard and say that he\u2019s got a saber in it and say, \u2018If you don\u2019t agree to my demands then I\u2019m going to end up pressing the nuclear button.\u2019\u201d Still, the news came as a surprise to many who had been watching the process closely. After months of tough talk by Mr. Trump, his administration had appeared to be on track to begin negotiations over Nafta as soon as this summer. Administration officials circulated the draft of a letter in March that laid out its goals in a negotiation, an obligatory step in the process. The letter seemed to suggest a far more modest approach than Mr. Trump had threatened, leaving much of Nafta intact. Before talks on negotiations can begin, the Trump administration would still need to consult with several congressional committees and formally inform Congress of its intention to renegotiate the treaty. In recent weeks, Trump administration officials had expressed frustration with the pace of that process, which has been slowed in part by delays in the confirmation of the administration\u2019s United States Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer. During the day on Wednesday, administration officials said the proposed executive order would trigger a different process for a withdrawal, with a six-month countdown. But it would not pre-empt the administration from continuing to pursue negotiations, leaving many observers in Mexico to interpret the threat of an order as a transparent, prenegotiation strategy. Antonio Garza, a former United States ambassador to Mexico, called Mr. Trump\u2019s possible executive order \u201chardball,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s probably not the way to deal with a counterparty that is both a longtime trading partner and critical to so many security, immigration and counterterrorism initiatives.\u201d Some speculated that Mr. Trump may have been trying to look tough to appeal to his voting base, particularly considering his mixed record in achieving his presidential goals as the 100-day mark of his term approaches. \u201cClearly, in Mexico, this should be seen as a type of tantrum of a spoiled child who did not get the presents he expected for his birthday, for the 100 days,\u201d said Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, an expert on United States-Mexico relations at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico in Mexico City. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration has publicly adopted a tough stance on Nafta, declaring its readiness to update the treaty but expressing its willingness to walk away from the table and from the trade agreement altogether. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has in recent weeks sent proxies, including his foreign minister and his ambassador to Washington, to reaffirm those positions. Mexicans have felt emboldened by the support they have received from prominent members of the American business community and elected officials \u2014 including Republicans on Capitol Hill \u2014 who have increasingly voiced their backing of Nafta and of the United States\u2019 alliance with Mexico. At the same time, mindful of Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line threats and unpredictability, Mexico has been exploring new trade deals with other countries and modernizing old ones. In congressional testimony in Mexico City on Tuesday, Luis Videgaray, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, reaffirmed the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration\u2019s position. \u201cWe are not going to accept any type of renegotiation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe prefer, in any event, to abandon the treaty than have a bad negotiation of the treaty, and in this we have been clear publicly and with the government of the United States.\u201d Mr. Sarukh\u00e1n said the Mexican government once faced Mr. Trump like \u201ca reindeer caught in the headlights in the middle of the woods,\u201d but had since adopted a more mature position, carefully picking its battles and issuing \u201csurgical, precision-delivered statements on the relationship and playing the grown-up.\u201d This stance, he said, was on display Wednesday.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/americas/mexico-trump-nafta-trade.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T11:58:49-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T11:57:18-04:00", "abstract": "President Trump used to be able to anger Mexico easily, but leaders there have developed a thicker skin as they prepare to renegotiate the Nafta trade pact with the United States.", "title": "A Calmer Mexico Sees Trump Anew: As a \u2018Bluffer\u2019 at the Poker Table"}
