{"text": "It\u2019s all fun and games until someone\u2019s password security question gets hacked. A meme making the rounds on Facebook asks users to list 10 concerts \u2014 nine they\u2019ve attended and a fabricated one \u2014 and invites others to identify the fake one. But the post \u2014 \u201c10 Concerts I\u2019ve Been To, One is a Lie\u201d \u2014 might also be an invitation to a midlevel threat to your online privacy and security, experts said. The meme, which surged in popularity this week, is the kind of frivolous distraction that makes up social media interactions, similar to other viral memes, such as the Ice Bucket Challenge. Privacy experts cautioned it could reveal too much about a person\u2019s background and preferences and sounds like a security question \u2014 name the first concert you attended \u2014 that you might be asked on a banking, brokerage or similar website to verify your identity. Michael Kaiser, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance, said on Friday that the meme posed a moderate security risk, adding that not every website relied on a security question about a person\u2019s first concert. He said the greater danger is what such a list might broadly reveal through social engineering. It could telegraph information about a user\u2019s age, musical tastes and even religious affiliation \u2014 all of which would be desirable to marketers hoping to target ads. He said it is similar to users who take quizzes on Facebook. The answers can reveal specifics about a person\u2019s upbringing, culture or other identifying details. \u201cYou are expressing things about you, maybe in more subtle ways than you might think,\u201d he said. Mark Testoni, a national security and privacy expert who is chief executive of SAP National Security Services, said in an email that he recommended exercising \u201cvigilance bordering on a little paranoia\u201d in online posts. \u201cWe need to understand how we interact can disclose not only specific details but patterns of behavior and often our location, among other things,\u201d he wrote. Alec Muffett, a software engineer and security researcher, wrote in an email that he is sympathetic to polls like the concert question. \u201cThey are cute, a little bit fun, you learn new things about your friends, and sometimes you get a surprise or two,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are certainly also polls that are geared towards collecting information which could be used to fraudulently \u2018recover\u2019 an account,\u201d he added. He said companies, governments and other groups rely on so-called authenticators, such as \u201cWhat is your mother\u2019s maiden name?\u201d Such answers are not truly authenticators, but are facts. \u201cThe usual aphorism is: \u2018Your password should be secret, but \u2018secrets\u2019 make really bad passwords\u2019 \u2014 especially when they are just discoverable or guessable facts,\u201d Mr. Muffett wrote. Mr. Kaiser agreed. In cases where the answer to a security question is easily obtained \u2014 what high school did you attend? \u2014 it\u2019s best to make up an answer, even if it\u2019s not as easy to recall. He said his advice about online quizzes and memes was not meant to be a killjoy, though he encouraged social media users to consider the consequences of what they share. \u201cPeople always have to have their eyes wide open when they\u2019re on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way of the world.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/technology/facebook-concerts-attend.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Technology", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T13:31:34-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T13:01:33-04:00", "abstract": "Privacy experts said the specific answers posted in response to the meme could be used by marketers to target ads or by hackers to breach secure accounts.", "title": "\u201810 Concerts\u2019 Facebook Meme May Reveal More Than Musical Tastes"}
