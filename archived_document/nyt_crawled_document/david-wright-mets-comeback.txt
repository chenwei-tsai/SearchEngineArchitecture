{"abstract": "General Manager Sandy Alderson said the Mets\u2019 captain and third baseman will resume baseball activities as early as Wednesday.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "Aside from participating in opening-day ceremonies at Citi Field, David Wright has largely been absent from the Mets\u2019 landscape this season. He received a respectful salute from fans that day, befitting his status as the team\u2019s captain, but players like Yoenis Cespedes and Noah Syndergaard received bigger ovations, a reflection of the fact that they are front and center for the 2017 season and Wright is not. Nevertheless, on Tuesday, Wright was seen bouncing around the Mets\u2019 clubhouse, ribbing teammates as the team began a one-week homestand. In the coming days, Wright will commence another rehabilitation assignment as he again tries to navigate his way back to the Mets\u2019 lineup. General Manager Sandy Alderson said Wright would begin baseball activity \u2014 fielding grounders, taking swings and perhaps engaging in throwing drills \u2014 as early as Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m realistically expecting to see him some time this year, but I don\u2019t have any real way of projecting a timetable,\u201d Alderson said before the Mets played the Philadelphia Phillies. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to be patient about that, but I certainly haven\u2019t given up hope of seeing him here in 2017, by any means.\u201d Alderson\u2019s cautious approach is understandable. Wright, who is 34, has not appeared in a game since last May 27. He has played only 75 regular-season games combined over the previous two seasons. Since May 2015, Wright has battled spinal stenosis. His 2016 season was cut short by a herniated disk in his neck, a problem that required fusion surgery. Two months ago, in spring training, Wright had to shut down because of soreness in his right shoulder. Wright, who is owed $20 million this season, in addition to $47 million more through 2020, has tried to rebound from repeated ailments. But every encouraging start is derailed by another physical setback. Just recently, Wright resumed light baseball activity, Alderson said, but was then stopped by the flu and discomfort in his back. When asked if the flaring up of back pain alarmed him, Alderson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d and then took a long pause. \u201cOne of a myriad of concerns, perhaps, but no more so than any of the others,\u201d he added. Wright is not the only Mets player who may return to the field Wednesday. Pitchers Seth Lugo and Steven Matz are expected to begin throwing from 75 feet, although Alderson did not believe either pitcher would be ready to rejoin the team any time soon. This month, Lugo was found to have a slight tear of the ulnar collateral ligament, an injury that can lead to Tommy John surgery. Alderson said the Mets will have to see how Lugo responds to throwing before they can gauge a timetable for his return. \u201cI think this is going to take a while,\u201d Alderson said. Alderson said he had no further information on the nature of Matz\u2019s left elbow injury \u2014 which Matz has described as a strained flexor tendon \u2014 only that he had been cleared to throw. Alderson was also unsure of how long it might take before Matz could come off the disabled list, but he said he did not think Matz would need a rehabilitation assignment that would equate to a full spring training. When asked if Matz could return by the end of May, Alderson offered his cagiest reply in an afternoon full of careful answers. \u201cPossibly,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cQuestion mark.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/sports/david-wright-mets-comeback.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T20:12:08-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "David Wright Is Ready for Another Comeback Try", "created_date": "2017-04-18T20:12:08-04:00", "section": "Sports"}
