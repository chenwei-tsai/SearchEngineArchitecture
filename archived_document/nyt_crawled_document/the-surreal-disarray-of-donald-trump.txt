{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cThis President Doesn\u2019t Go by the (History) Book\u201d (White House Memo, front page, May 2): Donald Trump\u2019s vision of American history, in this case his strange analysis of Andrew Jackson\u2019s settling the problem of the Civil War, strikes me as the perfect window into his political worldview. He puts outsize individuals at the center (Andrew Jackson in the 19th century; Vladimir Putin, Rodrigo Duterte and others today); garbles many of the details; emphasizes deal-making as the way to solve all problems; and reveals a startling ignorance about underlying issues or principles. His belief that the wealthy, slaveholding Andrew Jackson could have stopped Southern states from seceding over the issue of slavery shows the same blindness about core beliefs as his embrace of Mr. Duterte, the Philippine dictator. NINA SILBER, NEEDHAM, MASS. The writer is a professor of Civil War history at Boston University. To the Editor: I was concerned before about President Trump\u2019s state of mind and thinking process, but now I\u2019m really worried. The president over the last few days has made one bizarre statement after another, moving one presidential historian, Douglas Brinkley, to refer to a \u201csurreal disarray\u201d and \u201camong the most bizarre recent 24 hours in American presidential history.\u201d Some political analysts are concerned about his seeming mental confusion, as Mr. Trump appears to be detached from reality and history (for example, the Civil War could have been avoided if Andrew Jackson had been president). His flagrant and frequent flip-flops and cavalier choice of words are highly disturbing. Mr. Trump is still expressing admiration and appreciation for strongmen around the world. He has praised Vladimir Putin of Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and even the brutal and erratic dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, who he says is a \u201cpretty smart cookie\u201d whom he would be \u201chonored\u201d to meet. Rather than maturing and evolving into a reasoned and prudent leader, Mr. Trump seems to be devolving into an impetuous and willful one who does not understand the history of our country, or learn from it. Mr. Trump\u2019s recent behavior makes it abundantly clear that character and temperament really do matter. KEN DEROW, SWARTHMORE, PA. To the Editor: Re \u201cTrump Overture to North Korea Is Full of Risks\u201d (front page, May 2): With regard to President Trump\u2019s willingness to meet with people such as Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Kim Jong-un of North Korea, I would ask how the United States\u2019 superior and somewhat childish policy of having no consort with the leaders of regimes that behave in ways contrary to our values has done anything to change their ways. In fact, I would guess that for someone like Kim Jong-un, our disapproving posture may have exacerbated his aggressive stance. I don\u2019t see how sitting down leader to leader with someone considered a rogue and talking to him translates into an uncritical embrace of his behavior, or an abandonment of our own principles. ANNE MINICH, NEW YORK To the Editor: \u201cPresident Abruptly Ends CBS Interview After Question About Wiretaps\u201d (news article, May 2) notes that the White House on Monday released a 30-second political advertisement. This must be the first time in our nation\u2019s history that a sitting president, just a few months after taking office, feels the need to advertise on TV to convince voters that he knows what he is doing. All available evidence points to the fact that this man is far beyond his skill, intelligence, wisdom and administrative abilities in this role. No amount of TV ads will convince any thinking American that we are in good hands with Donald Trump\u2019s fake leadership. JAMES SHANNON, ST.
