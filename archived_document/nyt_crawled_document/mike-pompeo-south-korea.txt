{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, visited the South Korean capital on Monday amid heightened tensions with North Korea, and about a week before South Koreans vote for a new president, an embassy spokesman said on Monday. Mr. Pompeo, traveling with his wife, was in Seoul to meet with American diplomats and military officials, said the embassy spokesman, Daniel Turnbull. The C.I.A. chief had no meetings scheduled with officials from the South Korean president\u2019s office, Mr. Turnbull said, or with any of the candidates vying to succeed Park Geun-hye, who was impeached for corruption in December and removed from office in March. South Koreans will go to the polls to choose a new president on May 9. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s visit drew attention from the South Korean news media at a time of increasing anxiety on the Korean Peninsula over the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions and increased ballistic missile activity. North Korea carried out a missile test on Saturday that failed, the second consecutive failed test in the last two weeks. The projectile fired on Saturday \u2014 it was not clear what type of missile it was \u2014 exploded minutes after liftoff. News reports in South Korea speculated about which senior South Korean officials Mr. Pompeo might be meeting with on his visit to discuss the North\u2019s nuclear and missile abilities. The embassy did not disclose further details of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s trip. The North Korean missile test took place as the United States aircraft carrier Carl Vinson was sailing into Korean waters to conduct a joint naval exercise with South Korea. North Korea, which condemns the drill as a rehearsal for invasion, has threatened to turn the aircraft carrier into a \u201cgiant heap of scrap metal\u201d and \u201cbury it in the sea.\u201d South Korean and American officials have warned that the North could be preparing to conduct its sixth nuclear test. In recent weeks, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have made separate trips to Seoul reaffirming an alliance with South Korea under President Trump in the face of growing North Korean threats.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/world/asia/mike-pompeo-south-korea.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T10:52:02-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T10:52:02-04:00", "abstract": "His visit comes at a time of increasing anxiety on the Korean Peninsula over the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions and increased ballistic missile activity.", "title": "Mike Pompeo, C.I.A.
