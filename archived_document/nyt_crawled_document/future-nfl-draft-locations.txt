{"text": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The N.F.L. draft, which drew nearly 100,000 for opening-round festivities on Thursday, might be the league\u2019s second-most popular event, after the Super Bowl. And, as with that game, hosting the draft is about to become the objective of nearly every city that has an N.F.L. franchise. And even one that does not. Sixteen cities \u2014 half of those with N.F.L. teams \u2014 have officials in Philadelphia observing how the city handles the draft, as does the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. In all, 22 clubs and the Hall have expressed interest in hosting the draft. \u201cThe process is evolving because we have been in New York for 51 years,\u201d said Peter O\u2019Reilly, the league\u2019s senior vice president of events. \u201cWe looked to reimagine the draft in Chicago for the last two years, then made the decision to go to another major market in Philadelphia. \u201cObviously, the Super Bowl process bid is very formal, and the mode we\u2019re in now shows clearly a lot of interest in the draft from markets around the country.\u201d He added that the league was evaluating the event and wanted to build it up in the right way. So, in contrast to the Super Bowl, bidding to stage the draft is a yearly event for now; every Super Bowl through 2021 has already been awarded. Potential bidders have been told to consider hosting a draft sometime in the next five years. O\u2019Reilly said it took about 10 months to plan and put together the event. Representatives of the cities observing the draft this week said they were definitely interested. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Mike Waterman, president of the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau, who attended this week\u2019s event. \u201cWe had a truly amazing experience with the N.F.L. this past February as host city to Super Bowl 51.\u201d The league is seeking cities that can turn the event into a showcase that essentially takes over a city, as it did in Chicago and Philadelphia. Boston, for example, could offer the Common. Nashville has the Grand Ole Opry. The Miami area has South Beach. \u201cEvery city is unique,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cIt does get the creative juices flowing. We\u2019re not looking for cookie-cutter experiences, but for a natural place people gather for free events.\u201d Jacksonville, Fla., another of the potential bidders observing Philadelphia\u2019s draft this week, may have such a place, an amphitheater being constructed outside the Jaguars\u2019 stadium. \u201cWhat Chicago and Philadelphia have done is blend iconic buildings with the event, bringing together unique and different things,\u201d the Jaguars\u2019 president, Mark Lamping, said, noting that Jacksonville could blend its amphitheater, its bridges and its river for a football setting. \u201cIn addition, Radio City Musical Hall was a great draft venue for many years,\u201d Lamping said, \u201cand the seating bowl in our amphitheater was inspired by Radio City.\u201d The N.F.L. abandoned Radio City in part because of scheduling problems, but also because the league wondered how well the draft would travel. Crowds measured in six figures \u2014 not to mention the profitability for merchandisers, vendors and the cities themselves \u2014 indicated that the show would stay on the road. \u201cI believe highlighting important locations iconic to your city is good business,\u201d Houston\u2019s Waterman said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/football/future-nfl-draft-locations.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T19:56:19-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T19:56:19-04:00", "abstract": "The show in Philadelphia has drawn large attendance, and 22 clubs and the Pro Football Hall of Fame have expressed interested in hosting a draft in the near future.", "title": "N.F.L.
