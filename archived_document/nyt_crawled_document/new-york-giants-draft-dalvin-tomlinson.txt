{"text": "When a talented defensive lineman comes into view on the Giants\u2019 N.F.L. draft board, it seems that General Manager Jerry Reese finds it impossible to resist the temptation to fortify the unit. That was the case on Friday when Reese, the team\u2019s general manager since 2007, chose the run-stuffing defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson of Alabama with the 55th overall selection in the second round of the draft. Reese described Tomlinson (6-foot-3, 310 pounds) as an \u201cN.F.L. ready\u201d player capable of immediately stepping in as a replacement for Johnathan Hankins, who left to join the Indianapolis Colts as a free agent. Every Giants starter, other than Hankins, will return to a stifling defense that permitted a league-low 25 touchdowns last season. Fifty-five of Tomlinson\u2019s 62 tackles as a senior at Alabama came against the run. Reese prizes that attribute, especially in the rush-happy N.F.C. East. The rival Dallas Cowboys feature a potent ground game. \u201cIf you are going to rush the passer, you have to stop the run,\u201d Reese said. Reese chose Hankins in the second round in 2013. His other prominent defensive line selections include: tackle Jay Alford, third round, 2007; end Jason Pierre-Paul and tackle Linval Joseph, first and second rounds, 2010; tackle Marvin Austin, second round, 2011; Hankins, second round, 2013; tackle Jayson Bromley, third round, 2014; and end Owa Odighizuwa, fourth round, 2015. Those players achieved various levels of success; Pierre-Paul is the standout, having earned a contract extension because of his contributions. Reese indicated he was as impressed by Tomlinson when he interviewed him as when he watched his tackling ability on tape. Tomlinson, who could have attended Harvard, has overcome much in his life, including the death of both of his parents, as well as two knee operations. His father died when he was five. \u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t have been able to come back from it,\u201d he said. \u201cI did.\u201d Tomlinson totaled three sacks and seven quarterback hurries in his final season at Alabama and said he believed that he would show that he could be effective at rushing the quarterback. \u201cI feel I\u2019m a great pass rusher. I haven\u2019t been in position to show it a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an even better run stopper.\u201d What Tomlinson cannot address, however, is the Giants\u2019 needs on the offensive line. The team had been expected to target an offensive lineman in the draft, but this class had a dearth of quality tackles and guards on the offensive side. No offensive lineman was taken until the Denver Broncos selected tackle Garett Bolles from Utah 20th over all, the latest first selection of an offensive lineman in the history of the modern draft. The draft concludes with the last four rounds on Saturday, and the Giants will have one selection in each round.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/football/new-york-giants-draft-dalvin-tomlinson.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T22:55:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T22:55:03-04:00", "abstract": "The Giants under General Manager Jerry Reese have a habit of picking talented defensive linemen when they become available.", "title": "Giants Select Dalvin Tomlinson, an Alabama Lineman Who Stops the Run"}
