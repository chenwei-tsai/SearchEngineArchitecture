{"text": "CHICAGO \u2014 Barbara Byrd-Bennett, the former leader of this city\u2019s troubled public school system, was sentenced to four and a half years in federal prison on Friday for steering millions of dollars\u2019 worth of school district contracts to her former employer and for scheming to accept kickbacks. Ms. Byrd-Bennett, who was handpicked for her job by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, learned of her prison term as the almost-cashless district struggles to keep its classrooms open. Chicago Public Schools officials had warned that they could end the academic year on June 1, three weeks earlier than planned, unless the state of Illinois provided more money. Mr. Emanuel backed off that threat on Friday, but said he was not sure where the money would come from. \u201cWe will be here working to find the resources to make all of the other payments we have to make,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. The Chicago school district, which serves mostly black and Hispanic children, has challenged the state\u2019s funding mechanism as racially discriminatory. But the uncertainty was compounded on Friday when a judge declined to issue an injunction requested by the city that might have led to a desperately needed influx of cash. Fear of what might happen if schools closed weeks early prompted the Chicago Teachers Union and others to call for Mr. Emanuel to step in and provide stopgap funding. \u201cIt\u2019s a very precarious and dangerous situation,\u201d Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa said Friday before the mayor pledged to keep schools open. Mr. Ramirez-Rosa said he was \u201cvery fearful that we will see a spike in youth violence, that we will see a spike in the number of youth being shot and murdered in our streets, if the schools do not stay open past June 1.\u201d Though Chicago leaders have pointed to gains in graduation rates and test scores, the school system has lurched from calamity to calamity in recent years. Ms. Byrd-Bennett\u2019s sentencing closed one ugly chapter in that history, but the funding dispute and the district\u2019s paltry finances still linger, with credit rating agencies warning that the school system has depleted its reserves and struggles to pay for its pensions. Marcos Ceniceros, an organizer with the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, a community group on the Southwest Side, called the recent problems \u201cthe peak of the crisis\u201d after years of upheaval. \u201cNow it\u2019s come to a point where it\u2019s about keeping them open,\u201d Mr. Ceniceros said. He added it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that we have to have these conversations.\u201d Budget crunches also haunted the tenure of Ms. Byrd-Bennett, who in 2012 took over a district that had just weathered a teachers\u2019 strike. She quickly enraged many here by helping put in place a plan to close dozens of schools, mostly in black and Latino neighborhoods, in an effort to save money. Perceived as a seasoned leader of urban schools, with experience in Cleveland and Detroit, Ms. Byrd-Bennett was sought out to improve Chicago\u2019s schools, which enroll more than 380,000 children. But Ms. Byrd-Bennett raised suspicions after the school board approved a $20 million, no-bid contract with her former employer, a private company that provides training to school principals. She had schemed to steer school district business to the company, with the promise of kickbacks and a lucrative job that would be waiting for her whenever she left Chicago. She resigned in May 2015, shortly before being indicted. In a lengthy, tearful statement here on Friday in the federal district courtroom of Judge Edmond E. Chang, Ms. Byrd-Bennett apologized for her crimes and said, \u201cWhat I did was terribly wrong.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m especially sorry that I\u2019ve let down the students and their families,\u201d said Ms. Byrd-Bennett, who pleaded guilty, and who must surrender to a federal prison in West Virginia in August. Her sentence was more than what her lawyers had requested, but far less than the term of more than seven years that prosecutors had sought. Judge Chang noted the lengthy history of public corruption in Chicago and the school system\u2019s financial struggles as he handed down the punishment. \u201cWhen this crime was committed in the midst of the C.P.S. budget crisis, it did make it all the worse,\u201d Judge Chang said. Just minutes after Ms. Byrd-Bennett learned her fate at the federal courthouse, a Cook County judge a few blocks away denied the injunction request that would have helped Chicago schools stay open for the full academic year. That decision adds new urgency to a stalemate at the Illinois Capitol that has left the state without a permanent budget for nearly two years. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, has publicly feuded with Mr. Emanuel and his fellow Democrats who control the General Assembly. Mr. Rauner\u2019s administration fought the school district\u2019s attempt for an injunction. \u201cWith this distraction behind us, we can move forward on working with the General Assembly to fix our state\u2019s school funding formula,\u201d Beth Purvis, the Illinois secretary of education, said in a statement after the district\u2019s request was denied. But compromise has proved elusive at the Capitol. And at Chicago City Hall, officials voiced frustration with state leaders. \u201cKids belong in classrooms,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cThe legislators and the governor belong in both passing a budget and actually funding education to reverse these decades of inequitable funding.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/chicago-schools-barbara-byrd-bennett.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T20:40:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T20:40:24-04:00", "abstract": "The district\u2019s uncertainty was compounded when a judge declined to issue an injunction requested by the city that might have led to a desperately needed influx of cash.", "title": "Chicago Schools Ex-Leader Is Sentenced as Classrooms Struggle to Stay Open"}
