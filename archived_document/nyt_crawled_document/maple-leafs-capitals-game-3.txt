Andrew Benintendi hit a go-ahead, two-run single as Boston scored three unearned runs in the second inning after a dropped throw by Tampa Bay second baseman Brad Miller, and the Red Sox beat the Rays, 4-3, in the annual Patriots\u2019 Day game in Boston. Benintendi had three singles in the game, which began at 11:05 a.m. to coincide with the Boston Marathon. CARDINALS END THREE-GAME SKID Lance Lynn pitched seven shutout innings, Kolten Wong homered, and the Cardinals stopped a three-game losing streak, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates, 2-1, in St. Louis. The Cardinals, who had lost six of seven, are 4-9 and still have the worst record in the National League. BREWER HOMERS IN FIFTH STRAIGHT GAME Milwaukee Brewers first baseman Eric Thames tied a franchise record by homering in his fifth straight game. Thames, a former Korean baseball star, hit a solo shot off the Chicago Cubs\u2019 John Lackey in the third inning.

Jackson was named the Big 12\u2019s newcomer of the year after averaging 16.3 points and 7.4 rebounds per game in helping the Jayhawks to a 31-5 record and a berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament\u2019s round of 8. The Carolina Panthers made sure Kawann Short\u2019s contract situation would not end the same way Josh Norman\u2019s did a year ago. The Panthers signed Short, a Pro Bowl defensive tackle and their franchise player, to a five-year contract extension. Last year, the Panthers placed the franchise tag on Norman, an All-Pro cornerback, only to later rescind the offer. Norman became a free agent and signed with the Washington Redskins.", "abstract": "Tyler Bozak\u2019s goal 1:37 into overtime won Game 3 for Toronto after it had rallied from 2-0 and 3-1 deficits against Washington.", "section": "Sports", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/sports/maple-leafs-capitals-game-3.html", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Maple Leafs Rally and Defeat Capitals in Overtime", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-18T00:04:28-04:00"}
