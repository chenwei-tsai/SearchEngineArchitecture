Then Comes Marriage?", "material_type_facet": "News", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "For some of us, the dating app Tinder suggests a slot machine for sex, a game for singles featuring one too many bathroom selfies. For Casey Napolitano, a real estate agent in Los Angeles, Tinder is synonymous with love. Ms. Napolitano met her husband, John Napolitano, on the app during her first and only Tinder date. She \u201cswiped right\u201d on a photo of John in a tuxedo giving a speech at a wedding. \u201cIt just really turned me on,\u201d she said. Six months later, they bought a house together; a few months later, they were engaged. They have been married for two years now and have a 14-month-old. \u201cOur baby girl is perfect,\u201d the proud new father said. The Napolitanos\u2019 love story isn\u2019t isolated. According to Jessica Carbino, Tinder\u2019s on-site sociologist who pores over Tinder\u2019s data, more people than ever are committing to relationships thanks to the app, which will have its fifth anniversary in September. In a report released this week, Tinder conducted two surveys comparing its users with offline daters. (The offline daters fell into three groups: people who have never dated online, people who had dated online in the past but no longer did, and people who had never used online dating but were open to the possibility.) According to Ms. Carbino, the findings indicate that Tinder users are more likely to be looking for a committed relationship than are offline daters. She said that the surveys revealed that Tinder users were doing a better job than offline daters of signaling \u201cinvestment in prospective daters\u201d by asking them questions when originally contacting them, and that they are 5 percent more likely to say \u201cI love you\u201d to their partners in the first year of dating. The survey also reveals that while 30 percent of men who are not dating online say it is \u201cchallenging to commit,\u201d only 9 percent of male Tinder users say they find it difficult to maintain a committed relationship. The results were roughly similar for women. \u201cWhen you are dating online, you actually have a very clear idea of what the marketplace is like,\u201d Ms. Carbino said. \u201cYou are able to have a visual idea of the pool in front of you, whereas the people who aren\u2019t dating online are simply speculating as to what the pool may be like.\u201d The report looked at a survey administered via the app to 7,072 Tinder users, ages 18 to 36, and a second survey of 2,502 offline daters, ages 18 to 35, conducted by Morar Consulting. While the surveys were commissioned by Tinder, Ms. Carbino said her position as a social scientist was to provide a valid and realistic view of the world. \u201cThe realistic view might not provide what the company wants,\u201d she said, \u201chowever it\u2019s my responsibility to do so and provide data that is accurate.\u201d It is unclear whether the surveys sampled similar and representative demographics, a fact that Jennifer Lundquist, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who researches online dating, saidmore studies were needed to determine if Tinder\u2019s surveys were accurate. \u201cOne issue with the non-online dating comparison group is that given how normalized and destigmatized online dating has become for this age group, it\u2019s unusual not to participate in online dating,\u201d Professor Lundquist said. As a result, she said, the offline daters \u201c may be a weirdly skewed group, or as sociologists would say negatively select.\u201d Professor Lundquist also questioned the motivations for the survey, pointing to the anecdotal belief among many daters that Tinder\u2019s picture-based feature leads it to be a \u201chook up\u201d app rather than a mechanism for finding long-term partners. \u201cIt seems like Tinder is trying to work on their image with this survey,\u201d she said. But despite Tinder\u2019s aims, and researchers\u2019 varying methods, the app\u2019s conclusions about the desire of online daters to commit may not be unfounded. In a 2012 report on a study by the sociologists Michael Rosenfeld and Reuben J. Thomas published in the American Sociological Review, the researchers found that couples who meet online are no more likely to break up than couples who meet offline. Mr. Rosenfeld\u2019s continuing research at Stanford University concludes that couples who meet online transition to marriage more quickly than those who meet offline. (The cohort of couples he studied met in 2009, before Tinder was founded; he is currently gathering data that include users of the app.) Still, it is unclear whether Tinder\u2019s surveys, even bolstered by larger trends in online dating, will shift the public\u2019s perception of the app. It does not help that in a recent article in The California Sunday Magazine, Tinder\u2019s chief executive, Sean Rad, admitted to sexting with Snapchat users. But perhaps Ms. Carbino, who scours Tinder daily, sees what others can\u2019t: humans trying their best to connect. She is single and said she had found, and lost, love on Tinder.", "item_type": "Article"}
