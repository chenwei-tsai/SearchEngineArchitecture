{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s 10-Second Convictions\u201d (editorial, April 16): As I read through your examples of President Trump\u2019s flip-flops across a whole range of issues, the comedy turned to terror. His positions are influenced by the most immediate and frivolous considerations, mostly about superficial appearances. Can we survive what appear to be random choices on topics affecting millions of people, American society and even the viability of the planet? This is not just a president with no real interest in governing; this is a crisis \u2014 a man-child waving a loaded gun. We can duck and cover for only so long. Your editorial lamely concluded that he \u201cstop spinning and start delivering.\u201d Given the real and immediate dangers that the editorial outlined, we need to persuade him to resign or have him impeached.
