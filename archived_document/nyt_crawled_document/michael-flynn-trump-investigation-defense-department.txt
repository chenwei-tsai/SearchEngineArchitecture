{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, is under investigation by the Defense Department\u2019s inspector general to determine whether he failed to get permission to receive payment from a foreign government, according to a letter released on Thursday by the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. The committee also released a letter that said Mr. Flynn had been warned in 2014 not to accept payment from a foreign country without prior approval. Mr. Flynn, an unconventional and often controversial former three-star Army general, has become an increasingly problematic figure for the White House as revelations about his ties abroad continue to mount. He served in the administration for less than a month before being forced out for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his contact with the Russian ambassador. On Tuesday, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform announced it was likely Mr. Flynn violated federal law by failing to fully disclose his business dealings with Russia, an assertion they made after viewing classified documents that included a form seeking to renew his security clearance in January 2016. Those dealings included $45,000 from RT, the Kremlin-backed news network, for a 2015 speech he gave in Moscow. Lawmakers said Mr. Flynn did not include that payment on the form. He was photographed on that trip seated beside President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at a gala. After being forced out of the Trump administration, Mr. Flynn belatedly filed paperwork as a foreign agent for his work lobbying on behalf of Turkey\u2019s interests in the United States. He had been hired by a firm owned by a Turkish-American businessman with ties to the Turkish government. The firm paid him more than $500,000. Mr. Flynn has proposed being interviewed by congressional investigators examining Russian interference in the 2016 election in exchange for immunity, an offer lawmakers have not yet chosen to accept.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/michael-flynn-trump-investigation-defense-department.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T10:25:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T10:25:10-04:00", "abstract": "The department\u2019s inspector general is looking into whether the former top Trump adviser failed to get permission to receive the money.", "title": "Michael Flynn Under Defense Dept.
