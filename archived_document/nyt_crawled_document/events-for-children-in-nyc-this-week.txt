{"text": "Our guide to cultural events in New York City for families with children and teenagers. ARBOR WEEKEND at Wave Hill (April 28-30). A New York City childhood doesn\u2019t offer many opportunities to climb a tree, but Wave Hill, the Bronx garden, will invite visitors 5 and older to do just that on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. With safety harnesses, hard hats and help from professional arborists, the children will scale a venerable (and sturdy) sugar maple at the Junior Arborist Station at Arbor Weekend, a celebration including tree-focused garden walks, wood-turning demonstrations and a taste of the forest. (On Sunday, a chef will cook with juniper.) In \u201cBarking Up a Wave Hill Tree,\u201d a family art project on Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., children will also make bark rubbings and incorporate them into artworks using paper, fabric and yarn.718-549-3200, wavehill.org BROOKLYN FOLK FESTIVAL at St. Ann & the Holy Trinity Church (April 29-30). Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but a cigar box can often be many things \u2014 like the body of a ukulele. That\u2019s one of the interesting points young people will learn on Saturday at 2 p.m. in a workshop that Zeke Leonard will teach on making musical instruments from found objects. Other children\u2019s events at this festival, presented by the Jalopy Theater and School of Music, include a recital by youngsters from the school (Saturday at noon); a puppet show by the Boxcutter Collective (Saturday at 6:30 p.m.); a family singalong led by Emily Eagen (Sunday at 1:45 p.m.); and a concert by the Deedle Deedle Dees, known for rousing music with historical themes (Sunday at 2:30 p.m.).718-395-3214, brooklynfolkfest.com CHILDREN\u2019S DAY at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research at the Center for Jewish History (April 30, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.). This Children\u2019s Day is actually about an era: that experienced by young Jews in Europe before World War II. Accompanying the opening of the new exhibition \u201cYidishe Kinder: Jewish Children and Their World Before the Holocaust,\u201d this program will explore how children like Anne Frank lived, studied and played. The activities will include singalongs, led by the musician El\u00e9onore Biezunski; storytelling by the actor Shane Baker; and a puppet show based on an Isaac Bashevis Singer story, performed by John Bell and Trudi Cohen of Great Small Works.212-246-6080, yivo.org/children \u2018MUFARO\u2019S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS: AN AFRICAN TALE\u2019 at Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts (April 29, 2 p.m.). The two young women at the heart of this Zimbabwean legend are lovely, but only one has a character to match. This Dallas Children\u2019s Theater musical, based on John Steptoe\u2019s picture book adaptation of the fable, follows the sisters, each considered eligible to marry the king, as they traverse a mystical jungle on their way to be presented to him. Here, the journey \u2014 evoked in Karen Abbott\u2019s book and S-Ankh Rasa\u2019s music and lyrics \u2014 is as important as the destination. And after the show, the National Grid Earth Day Celebration, with music, puppets, circus arts and environmental displays, will unfold at 3 p.m. on the plaza outside.718-951-4500, brooklyncenter.org \u2018MY KID COULD DO THAT\u2019 at Red Bull Arts New York (April 29, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.) Someone\u2019s kid did do that: Every work in this free one-day exhibition was made by a person between the ages of 5 and 17. But what makes these 23 pieces different from everyday juvenilia is that the creators all grew up to be important artists. Presented by ProjectArt, a nonprofit offering children\u2019s workshops in New York, Detroit and Miami libraries, this Chelsea show includes a resin cat Urs Fischer sculpted at 8; a self-portrait in Japanese dress, done by Laurie Simmons at 10; and a brooding study of an eye by the 15-year-old Olafur Eliasson. Young visitors can read artists\u2019 statements \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve never liked drawing exactly what I see,\u201d Kiki Valdes says \u2014 and develop their skills in a drop-in drawing and collage workshop that Mr. Valdes will teach from 1 to 3 p.m. Families can also take heart: While some works display extraordinary precocious talent, others look as if, well, your kid could do that.redbullartsnewyork.com  SPRING FAMILY FAIR at the Morgan Library & Museum (April 30, 2-4:30 p.m.). The 21st-century selfie meets the 19th-century silhouette in this program at the Morgan, which seeks to engage children in the library\u2019s exhibitions \u201cI\u2019m Nobody! Who are You? The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson\u201d and \u201cTreasures From the Nationalmuseum of Sweden.\u201d Young visitors can create 1800s-style silhouettes of either themselves or a loved one, or dress up in vintage-looking costumes for a digital photography session in the museum\u2019s parlors. Among the other activities are writing verse on the Morgan\u2019s Poetry Wall; decorating paper Dala horses, patterned after the Swedish wooden ones; and watching short films, including a documentary on Dickinson.212-685-0008, themorgan.org \u2018WILD KRATTS \u2014 LIVE!\u2019 at the Beacon Theater (April 30, 2 and 6 p.m.). Kratts aren\u2019t a furry or feathered species, though they do interact regularly with animals. They\u2019re the brothers Martin and Chris Kratt, zoologists who portray animated versions of themselves on the PBS children\u2019s series \u201cWild Kratts.\u201d In this production, they\u2019ll appear live onstage, where they\u2019ll activate their characters\u2019 creature powers and embark on an adventure in which they\u2019ll have to retrieve one of their favorite inventions from the villain Zach Varmitech \u2014 and teach some intriguing wildlife facts along the way.800-745-3000, wildkrattslive.com", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/events-for-children-in-nyc-this-week.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T19:24:09-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T19:24:09-04:00", "abstract": "Our guide to cultural events in New York City for families with children and teenagers.", "title": "Events for Children in NYC This Week"}
