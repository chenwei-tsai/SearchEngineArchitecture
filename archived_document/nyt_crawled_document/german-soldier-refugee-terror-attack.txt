{"text": "BERLIN \u2014 A German Army lieutenant appears to have taken advantage of his country\u2019s chaotic system of processing migrants in 2015 to pose as a Syrian asylum seeker with the intention of carrying out an attack, the authorities said on Thursday. Prosecutors said the man, whose name was not released, was a 28-year-old German from the city of Offenbach, near Frankfurt, who was stationed with the German Army at the Illkirch base in France, near the German border. He is suspected of planning a violent attack, weapons violations and fraud, prosecutors in Frankfurt said. They were not aware of any specific targets, said Nadja Niesen, a spokeswoman for the prosecutors. The man first caught the attention of Austrian authorities in January, when he stashed a loaded pistol in a cleaning shaft in a toilet at Vienna International Airport. He was detained on Feb. 3 when he returned to recover the weapon, prosecutors said. Investigators discovered that the suspect, using a false identity, registered in December 2015 with German officials in Giessen, about 40 miles north of Frankfurt, as a Syrian refugee. It was not clear what steps officials took to verify his claim, given that he appeared to speak no Arabic, Ms. Niesen said. \u201cWhy that did not catch their attention, I am not able to say,\u201d she said. The man was processed as a refugee and assigned to an initial processing center in Zirndorf, in the southern state of Bavaria, where he submitted an application for asylum. \u201cHe did all of this parallel\u201d to his duties as a soldier, Ms. Niesen said. \u201cHe appeared to live a double life.\u201d More than a million people poured across Germany\u2019s borders from 2015 to 2016, straining the registration system and leaving it vulnerable to exploitation. Since January 2016, the suspect had been drawing the monthly financial stipend provided by the German government for refugees, prosecutors said. \u201cThis knowledge, as well as anecdotal evidence indicating the soldier had a xenophobic background, lead to the suspicion that the defendant had planned to carry out a violent criminal act, an attack, with the weapon hidden in Vienna airport,\u201d prosecutors said. About 90 officers searched the man\u2019s home, as well as locations in France and Austria, prosecutors said. Another suspect, identified only as a 24-year-old student from Offenbach, was also detained, they said. The student knew about the soldier\u2019s ruse and might have helped him, officials said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/europe/german-soldier-refugee-terror-attack.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T08:29:47-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T08:29:47-04:00", "abstract": "The army lieutenant, 28, who was said to have a \u201cxenophobic background,\u201d hid a loaded pistol at an airport in Vienna, prompting fears he had been planning an assault.", "title": "German Soldier Posed as Syrian Refugee to Plan Attack, Officials Say"}
