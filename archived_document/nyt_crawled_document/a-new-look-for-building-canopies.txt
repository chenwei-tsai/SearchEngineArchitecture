{"text": "If you notice walkers slowing down in front of 41 Park Avenue in Manhattan, and wonder why, just look up. Sheltering the sidewalk is a fabric entrance canopy printed on top and bottom with a graphic treatment by Ara Starck, the Paris-born, New York-based artist. Seen from below, the work, named Stonehenge Stellaris, offers a surreal take on the heavens \u2014 an abstract map of Manhattan depicting Stonehenge NYC\u2019s 23 rental buildings as constellations, where your location is indicated by a company logo. The top of the canopy, viewable from apartments above, depicts leafy branches that blossom into human hands. \u201cThe awning is very important because it\u2019s the first thing that greets you and then the last thing you see when you leave,\u201d said Ms. Starck, a daughter of the high-profile designer Philippe Starck. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of painter who thinks that art should be in a gallery,\u201d added Ms. Starck, who has painted expansive ceilings in hotels designed by her father, including Le Meurice in Paris and SLS South Beach in Miami Beach. \u201cThe more I can go outside the frame, or even outside on the street, the happier I am.\u201d Manhattan\u2019s ubiquitous entrance canopies, typically made with plain fabric pulled over a metal frame, seemed ripe for creative experimentation, Ms. Starck said, because they were almost \u201ca blank canvas.\u201d To realize the canopy at 41 Park Avenue, she painted and then digitally scanned artwork so it could be printed on the durable fabric. Over the coming years, as the canopies at Stonehenge NYC\u2019s other buildings need to be replaced, all are expected to receive the same treatment, customized for location. Other developers and designers have also turned their attention to what stands sentry over the entrances to buildings. In condominium projects by the development firm DDG, \u201cthe awning is of critical importance, because it drives the arrival sequence,\u201d said Joseph A. McMillan Jr., chairman and chief executive. \u201cWe attempt to combine the practical with the whimsical.\u201d At 12 Warren, for instance, the canopy is clad in rough-hewed chunks of bluestone, the same material used in the building facade, and will be planted on top to look almost like a wild mountain ledge. It is similar to DDG\u2019s building at 345 West 14th Street, where a concrete canopy with a shape reflecting the meatpacking district\u2019s traditional steel canopies is punctured with large kidney-shaped holes to provide views from the sidewalk to vegetation growing on top. \u201cYou walk under the garden,\u201d Mr. McMillan said. \u201cIt really causes people to stop and look; that\u2019s something we endeavor to do with all our projects.\u201d At Extell Development Company\u2019s One57, designed by the architect Christian de Portzamparc, a pair of canopies were given a sculptural treatment to look as though the building\u2019s facade has curled up in a series of rippling ribbons. Even at buildings that aim for a more traditional sense of luxury, canopies are being updated. \u201cFabric canopies grow out of this very old New York tradition, but they have become much more sophisticated than they used to be,\u201d said Paul L. Whalen, a partner at Robert A. M. Stern Architects. At the Four Seasons Private Residences at 30 Park Place, for instance, the fabric canopy that Mr. Whalen and his team designed has a vaguely wavelike form, and contains integrated heating and concealed lighting that makes the whole underside glow at night. Sculptural faux-bois bronze posts will also soon replace temporary stainless steel ones. Going to such lengths is worth it, because a distinctive canopy can say a lot about a building\u2019s style and aspirations, Mr. Whalen noted: \u201cIt is the building\u2019s calling card on the street.\u201d Ofer Yardeni, the chairman and chief executive of Stonehenge NYC, said his company had created a certain lifestyle for its buildings. \u201cWhen it came to the front of the building, we also had a desire to create something different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had the desire for people to stop and say \u2018Wow,\u2019\u201d which is why Stonehenge\u2019s canopies chose the art of Ms. Starck, a painter who is married to David Furst, the international picture editor for The New York Times. \u201cWhy should art only be inside the apartments?\u201d Mr. Yardeni said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/realestate/a-new-look-for-building-canopies.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T12:00:48-04:00", "abstract": "To differentiate their buildings, developers are commissioning unique canopies to make the entrances to their buildings stand out.", "title": "A New Look for Building Canopies", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Real Estate", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T12:00:48-04:00"}
