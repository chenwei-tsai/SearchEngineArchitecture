{"text": "The Boston Red Sox apologized on Tuesday morning, a day after Orioles outfielder Adam Jones said he was subjected to racist abuse and had objects thrown at him from the crowd at Fenway Park on Monday night. \u201cThe Red Sox want to publicly apologize to Adam Jones and the entire Orioles organization for what occurred at Fenway Park Monday night,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cNo player should have an object thrown at him on the playing field, nor be subjected to any kind of racism at Fenway Park. The Red Sox have zero tolerance for such inexcusable behavior, and our entire organization and our fans are sickened by the conduct of an ignorant few. Such conduct should be reported immediately to Red Sox security, and any spectator behaving in this manner forfeits his/her right to remain in the ballpark, and may be subject to further action. Our review of last night\u2019s events is ongoing.\u201d After Monday night\u2019s 5-2 Orioles victory over the Red Sox in Boston, Jones told The Boston Globe, \u201cA disrespectful person threw a bag of peanuts at me and I got called the N-word a handful of times.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that people need to resort to those type of epithets to degrade another human being,\u201d he said. Jones said he had been racially taunted in Boston on other occasions as well. There was bad blood between the teams last month after the Orioles\u2019 Manny Machado spiked Boston\u2019s Dustin Pedroia while sliding. Two days later, Boston pitcher Matt Barnes was ejected after throwing a fastball behind Machado\u2019s head.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/sports/baseball/adam-jones-orioles-red-sox-racist-taunts.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T10:02:50-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T09:58:08-04:00", "abstract": "Jones, an Orioles outfielder, said he also had objects thrown at him from the crowd in Boston on Monday night.", "title": "Red Sox Apologize After Adam Jones Endures Racist Taunts at Fenway"}
