That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. You know that mix of freedom and anxiety you felt when your parents went away for the weekend and you had the house to yourself? We\u2019re feeling that way at New York Times Cooking. Sam Sifton is off to Australia for a couple of weeks, so we\u2019re dancing around like Tom Cruise in his underwear. On second thought, try to unsee that. Food will help. Here on our no-recipe recipe days (which some people call Wednesday) we like to remind you that your seemingly empty larder actually holds dinner. Ink-stained devotees of today\u2019s print edition can learn much about how to loosen their death grip on the recipe from Samin Nosrat. Everyone\u2019s in love with her new book, \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat.\u201d (We have a girl crush on the pasta guide she did for us.) And I don\u2019t know anyone who is better at teaching the ethos of no-recipe cooking. Today\u2019s master class is on salt. Walk through her approaches to buttermilk-marinated roast chicken and Caesar salad, and learn. As for me, I\u2019m thinking about making bread soup because I haven\u2019t finished that great country loaf I bought from the nice kids at the farmers\u2019 market. Start by tearing some sturdy, slightly stale bread into a couple of cups\u2019 worth of bite-size pieces, and heat some olive oil in a big saucepan. Chop some garlic \u2014 this is a good time to use that green garlic you bought and don\u2019t know what to do with \u2014 and a little onion, then cook that down with plenty of salt and some pepper. You can also add some of that greenmarket kale that\u2019s giving you the side eye. Add four or five cups of stock or water, and maybe some chopped dried or fresh chiles, and bring it to a boil. Stir in the bread and simmer for five or six minutes. Then, if you like, crack an egg per person into the pot, cover it and ladle it into bowls a few minutes later, with a sprinkling of grated cheese. You could drizzle on some chive oil, which is nothing more than finely chopped chives and olive oil with some salt, a trick I picked up from Paula Wolfert\u2019s husband when I was at her house this year. It goes great over her no-miss oven-steamed salmon. In keeping with our old bread theme, you\u2019ll also want to check out Larissa Zimberoff\u2019s story about Toast ale, beer made in New York by British waste reduction soldiers. And you know what goes great with beer? Crispy chickpeas with ground meat thrown together by that minx Mark Bittman. Of course, if all this seems like too much for a Wednesday, you could always make a bowl of perfect instant ramen from our much-missed colleague Jeff Gordinier or skip dinner altogether and just make chocolate chip cookies. Then settle into \u201cNotes on a Banana: A Memoir of Food, Love and Manic Depression,\u201d the new memoir by the man who brought us that recipe, the charming David Leite. He recently spoke with Francis Lam  on The Splendid Table, which devoted the whole show to feeding family. (Loved the star turn by Pableaux Johnson and his Monday red bean parties.) As always, do look through the offerings at Cooking and rate recipes you like or don\u2019t like. Leave comments for fellow cooks on recipes you\u2019ve made. It\u2019s the right thing to do. Last, please don\u2019t worry about Sifton. While he\u2019s off doing Sam, a great and dedicated crew is available to help out at cookingcare@nytimes.com.", "created_date": "2017-04-26T11:10:04-04:00", "section": "Food", "abstract": "Turn an old loaf into a hearty soup, or let Samin Nosrat lead you on a path to no-recipe cooking.", "item_type": "Article"}
