He called Mr. Soros \u201can open enemy of the euro,\u201d a reference to the role  currency speculation played in building Mr. Soros\u2019s fortune. It was an exceptional attack by a head of government against a private citizen, albeit a wealthy and powerful one. Mr. Soros has been a frequent target of criticism from right-wing news media organizations like Breitbart and Infowars, which deplore his affinity for Democratic and liberal causes. Supporters of Mr. Soros, who is 86, a native of Hungary and a Holocaust survivor, have detected a whiff of anti-Semitism in the attacks in the United States. In 1991, after the fall of communism, Mr. Soros founded Central European University, which is based in Budapest and accredited in Hungary and the United States. A law recently rushed through Hungary\u2019s Parliament would force the university to close if it did not open an American campus. American and European officials have condemned the law, which sent a chill through academic circles in Hungary and resulted in protests by tens of thousands of people against Mr. Orban and his embrace of \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d which puts majority rule over pluralist expression and minority rights. In a letter to Hungary on Wednesday, the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, raised objections. \u201cRecent developments in Hungary have got many people worried in the E.U. but also in the outside world. We share those worries and concerns,\u201d Frans Timmermans, the commission\u2019s first vice president, told lawmakers in Brussels, summarizing the letter as Mr. Orban looked on with a stony expression. Mr. Timmermans said the commission was also monitoring Hungary\u2019s harsh new asylum law and a proposal that would intensify scrutiny of nongovernmental organizations that get foreign funding. The commission also criticized what it called false and misleading claims by the Hungarian government, which \u2014 like other right-wing populist groups across Europe \u2014 has railed against Brussels. \u201cThe European Union is a project driven and designed by its member states,\u201d Mr. Timmermans said, reminding Hungary that it had signed on to \u201cthe rules of the club.\u201d Mr. Orban insisted on Wednesday that he had not abandoned Europe. He said the law affecting universities was a \u201csmall amendment\u201d that merely \u201cunifies the rules that apply to them, closes the possibility of speculations and abuses, demands transparency, and eliminates the privileged position these institutions enjoyed over European universities.\u201d (Observers say the law, while crafted to appear neutral, in reality mostly targets Central European University.) Mr. Orban also tried to portray himself as a victim. \u201cIt is like when someone is accused of murder and convicted, while the victim of the alleged crime is alive and well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd pointing and shouting \u2018murderer\u2019 at the convict himself.\u201d Central European University\u2019s president, Michael Ignatieff, visited Brussels on Tuesday to plead the school\u2019s case. He said he was cautiously optimistic that the European Commission would take action on Wednesday. In a statement, Christopher Stone, the president of the Open Society Foundations, Mr. Soros\u2019s main philanthropy in the United States, called Mr. Orban\u2019s allegations \u201cpatently false.\u201d \u201cOver the past three decades George Soros and the Open Society Foundations have given $400 million to help support justice, education and human rights in Hungary, benefiting hundreds of thousands of Hungarians,\u201d Mr. Stone said. The commission\u2019s action, known as a \u201cletter of formal notice,\u201d is unlikely to yield immediate results. It is essentially a warning to Hungary not to infringe on rights including academic freedom and the right to conduct business or provide services. Hungary\u2019s government has a month to respond. If a member state fails to uphold the rule of law, the commission could in principle invoke sanctions \u2014 including what is known in Brussels as the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d the suspension of voting rights. But in reality, any such action would be vulnerable to veto from governments like that of Romania, which has often sided with Mr. Orban. Jan Komarek, a lecturer in the European Institute at the London School of Economics, said in a phone interview from Prague that Mr. Orban\u2019s hard-line stance against the European Union might have little downside at home. Mr. Komarek noted that in 2012, the European Commission warned Hungary over its increasing control of the judiciary, which included a compulsory retirement age for judges. Hungary eventually settled the matter, but by then, several senior judges had been purged from the judiciary, never to return. Mark Dawson, professor of European law and governance at the Hertie School of Governance, said the European Commission\u2019s procedures were too weak, and highly legalistic. \u201cIf we have an E.U. that is based on an idea of a political union,\u201d he added, \u201cit has to mean something at the end of the day.\u201d", "section": "World", "abstract": "At a meeting of European lawmakers, Prime Minister Viktor Orban called the Hungarian-American financier \u201can open enemy of the euro.\u201d", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T15:33:49-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/europe/soros-orban-hungary-eu-central-european-university.html", "title": "Chided by Brussels, Hungary\u2019s Leader Attacks George Soros"}
