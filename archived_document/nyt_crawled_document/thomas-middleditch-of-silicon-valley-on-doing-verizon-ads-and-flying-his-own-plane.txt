The character is \u201cjust one element\u201d of what he sarcastically described as \u201cthe Middleditch brand.\u201d Just then, his voice was drowned out by the sounds of several exuberant children rushing into the cafe. \u201cTimes have changed,\u201d he said with mock exasperation, once the noise had abated. \u201cThey give kids caffeine. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d Awkwardly funny moments just seem to follow Mr. Middleditch, 35, a wide-eyed actor from the small Canadian city of Nelson, British Columbia, wherever he goes. There are plenty more on \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d whose fourth season (which starts on Sunday, April 23) finds Richard at odds with his collaborators Bachman (T. J. Miller), Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani), Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) and Jared (Zach Woods), while seeking common ground with his rival Gavin Belson (Matt Ross). Mr. Middleditch discussed identifying with Richard, his evolution as an actor and his new plane. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Richard Hendricks\u2019s defining attribute may be his gracelessness. Do you share any of that with him? Hey, man, I\u2019m smooth. I\u2019m cool as a cucumber, baby. He wouldn\u2019t even know to make that joke. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve never been awkward myself. I\u2019m a big gamer, so I\u2019ve had access to that type of personality. I used to go to these LAN parties, that was before high-speed internet. The only way you could get lag-free gaming was to haul these huge computers to people\u2019s houses. There was always some guy who was potentially on the spectrum, who knew everything about troubleshooting all the network issues and was crucial to the whole thing. Do you think Richard has grown over the four seasons of the show? He\u2019s got a pretty strong moral compass. That\u2019s the thing that gets challenged in the fourth season. And if I have it my way \u2014 which I don\u2019t, really \u2014 that\u2019ll be the thing that we deal with a lot in Season 5. How \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d is Richard going to get? Near the end of the season that\u2019s coming up, a few things come into play, where he might have to do the unthinkable. Did you ever expect that playing him would also land you a Verizon endorsement deal? Ten, 15 years ago, if you were on a successful TV show or in a movie, and you did a commercial, everyone would go, \u201cOh, his career\u2019s over.\u201d But now, it\u2019s the opposite. Studios look at it and go, this major corporation put a ton of money behind this person \u2014 he must be marketable. You get your sellout money and a nod from studios. You\u2019re also a longtime member of the Improvised Shakespeare Company. Does that mean you\u2019re well versed in the works of the Bard? Short answer, no. I was always the bad student. When we started doing this group, the director got this Shakespeare professor to give us reading homework, and then we\u2019d come back to this class and have a private analysis. I was reading the CliffsNotes. And then just sitting in class, falling asleep, being like, \u201cUh-huh, uh-huh.\u201d You watch the show, and you\u2019re like, \u201cThese guys know what they\u2019re doing \u2014 this guy\u2019s an idiot.\u201d When did you get turned onto acting? In eighth grade, when I was just the school weirdo, my drama teacher put me in a play, and we came up with a few comedy bits. And that very first reaction, for an audience of supportive middle schoolers, I put my head out and pretended I got scared by the audience, and ducked back in. They all went: \u201cYeah! That\u2019s great!\u201d I remember that very specific moment of hiding behind that curtain, being like, whoa, what is this? What do you do in your free time? For a while, I was getting involved in current events, and it bummed me out too much. I still play video games. I got my pilot\u2019s license last year, because I finally had the means to do it. What kind of craft do you fly? Am I using the right lingo? What\u2019s my bird? [laughs] I got one of the more fuel-efficient, general-aviation airplanes out there. It\u2019s called the Diamond DA40. It only widens the gap between the Hollywood elite and the common man, really, talking about what plane I\u2019ve got. Can you text and fly? You can. Honestly, when everything is on autopilot, there\u2019s nothing else to do. My writing partner and I took our script and got work done while we were flying.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T10:00:20-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/arts/television/thomas-middleditch-of-silicon-valley-on-doing-verizon-ads-and-flying-his-own-plane.html", "item_type": "Article"}
