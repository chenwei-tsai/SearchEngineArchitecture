Then he began singing, in a brassy growl, \u201cIt aaaaain\u2019t necessarily so ...\u201d Yes, it was that Bill Murray, the actor and comedian. And yes, he was singing Gershwin with classical accompanists, as part of a rehearsal and recording session in a Manhattan studio last week for his latest unexpected project: \u201cNew Worlds,\u201d a program of songs and literary readings paired with chamber music led by the cellist Jan Vogler. Mr. Murray, 66, may always be recognized by his fans as one of the world\u2019s greatest comedians. But for nearly two decades, he has been breaking down every expectation of the career path of a Hollywood comedy star, playing moody and haunted characters in films like \u201cLost in Translation\u201d and \u201cBroken Flowers,\u201d indulging his love of poetry and thrilling fans with unexpected encounters. With \u201cNew Worlds,\u201d Mr. Murray is pushing further into surprise territory. The program has him singing Stephen Foster\u2019s \u201cJeanie With the Light Brown Hair\u201d and songs from \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d and reading Whitman and Hemingway while Mr. Vogler\u2019s trio \u2014 which includes Mira Wang, his wife, on violin, and Vanessa Perez at the piano \u2014 plays Schubert, Bach and Piazzolla. It will have its United States premiere at Festival Napa Valley in California on July 20, followed by a North American tour that will come to Carnegie Hall on Oct. 16. In an interview after the rehearsal, Mr. Murray described the group\u2019s interaction in a way that sounded more Yoda than Dr. Peter Venkman, his wisecracking character in \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d \u201cWhen they start playing,\u201d he said, \u201cthe demand is so great that if you are attending to who you are right now, it brings out something that you couldn\u2019t have visualized or planned for. You hear all those other voices saying, \u2018That didn\u2019t sound like Tony Bennett,\u2019 or, \u2018That B flat\u2019s not going to break a light bulb.\u2019 But they\u2019re receding. They\u2019re gone.\u201d The project had its origins in early 2013, when the two men sat across from each other on a flight from Berlin to New York. They struck up a friendship, mingled in each other\u2019s creative circles, and two years ago Mr. Murray invited Mr. Vogler to Poets House\u2019s annual poetry walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. Soon after, they began developing the idea for their project, which is being billed as Bill Murray, Jan Vogler & Friends. \u201cI still remember those days at your house, sitting around the fireplace with a pile of books and some good music,\u201d said Mr. Vogler, 53, looking at Mr. Murray with a boyish smile. At the session last week, Mr. Murray wore a loosefitting salmon shirt and a white and black bandanna, and complimented his colleagues by saying that one passage \u201cmakes me laugh.\u201d At one point, Sofia Coppola wandered in (of course), hugged Mr. Murray and then pulled out her phone to shoot some video of him singing Van Morrison. Later, Ms. Coppola \u2014 who directed Mr. Murray in \u201cLost in Translation\u201d and his most recent film-musical outing, the 2015 Netflix special \u201cA Very Murray Christmas\u201d \u2014 said that Mr. Murray had told her only that he was working on \u201ca music show.\u201d \u201cThis is very unexpected,\u201d she said. \u201cBut because it\u2019s Bill, I\u2019m not surprised. He is always surprising. That\u2019s what\u2019s fun about him.\u201d A classical show with a Hollywood star might naturally draw some skepticism from conservative audiences. But Mr. Vogler, who has played with major orchestras like the New York Philharmonic, lends the project credibility, and Sonia Tolbert, the general manager of Festival Napa Valley, said that since the event was booked and advertised, \u201cNobody sees it as a stunt of any kind.\u201d (The festival did, however, move it to a larger theater to accommodate ticket demand, she added.) Mr. Murray also recently made a vocal appearance on Paul Shaffer\u2019s latest album, singing an upbeat song called \u201cHappy Street.\u201d The \u201cNew Worlds\u201d recording, planned for release in August, is intended as a memento of the shows. \u201cI always see it as like, singer-songwriters have a bunch of discs in the trunk of the car,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cBut I guess this is what they do in the classical racket, too.\u201d With an ensemble that includes members born in the United States, China, East Germany and Argentina, \u201cNew Worlds\u201d will explore themes of American history and identity. One setting has Mr. Murray reading a painful passage from \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d as the group plays \u201cMoon River.\u201d Mr. Vogler said he first encountered the classics of American literature through his father\u2019s library in East Berlin. \u201cI grew up with Mark Twain, and we had the complete Hemingway at home,\u201d he said, \u201cof course in German translation.\u201d Mr. Murray described the idea as \u201cthe collision of America and Europe,\u201d in part reflected in the backgrounds of each of the four members of his new group. \u201cWe are from four different continents,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when the continents come together, the music moves right across the peninsulas from one to the other. It\u2019s just a short journey from one continent to the other.\u201d", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
