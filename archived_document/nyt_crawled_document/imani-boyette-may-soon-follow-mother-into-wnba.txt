McGee\u2019s mother had given it to her before McGee entered the W.N.B.A. in 1997, when she was the second pick in the league\u2019s first draft. Boyette, 21, who could be a first-round selection in Thursday\u2019s draft, said this week that the gift reminded her that \u201cthere\u2019s ups and downs, but the world keeps going.\u201d Just as meaningful for mother and daughter is their reclaimed relationship after years of disconnect. Boyette experienced a jarring range of emotions during her youth, including the despair of suicide attempts and childhood sexual abuse, and the heights of marriage and on-court success as a 6-foot-7 defensive dynamo at the University of Texas. \u201cShe\u2019s a survivor,\u201d said Tina Thompson, an assistant coach at Texas and a family friend. \u201cShe definitely persevered. I feel that she\u2019s one of those people that her circumstances aren\u2019t going to beat her. She\u2019s going to find a way over it and/or around it.\u201d When Boyette was 3, she became entrenched in a custody fight between her mother and her father, Kevin Stafford. Lawyers argued that McGee\u2019s professional basketball career interfered with her parenting. Boyette lived with Stafford in California while her half brother, JaVale McGee, now a forward for the Dallas Mavericks, moved in with McGee. Boyette said she had not begun having regular contact with her mother again until she was 13, but even then, they spent the majority of her high school years engaged in arguments. \u201cWe had a lot of the same kind of hurt,\u201d Boyette said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you have an absent parent because the child blames the parent and the parent blames the child via the father. Just kind of understanding that we both were hurt in a bad situation and being able to meet each other halfway really helped our relationship.\u201d In part because she thought she was unskilled at basketball early on, Boyette rarely told friends or teammates about her strong lineage \u2014 an aunt, Trisha Stafford-Odom, also played in the W.N.B.A., and Pamela McGee won two national titles at Southern California with her sister, Paula. \u201cI kept people at arm\u2019s length,\u201d Boyette said. \u201cEveryone felt like they knew me, but I didn\u2019t really tell them anything relevant, invite them places. I wasn\u2019t actively seeking friendship.\u201d Boyette never saw basketball as a potential career, but at 6-7, she thought she could earn a college scholarship. Off the court, Boyette hid the searing wounds: three suicide attempts before she graduated from high school and a history of sexual abuse. She has not named her abuser. She found solace in poetry. Brady Sanders, Boyette\u2019s roommate during Texas road trips, often saw Boyette writing in their hotel room but thought she was busy with homework. Eventually, Boyette opened up to Sanders, then invited a few teammates to a reading and slowly began to share her work and a side of her that had previously been unseen. \u201cIt\u2019s just empowering, knowing that she\u2019s been through that and has gotten to where she is now,\u201d Sanders said. During her freshman year at Texas, Boyette met Paul Boyette, a defensive lineman on the football team. He helped persuade her to discuss her abuse with her parents; later, he pushed her to mend her relationship with her mother. The Boyettes married last July. \u201cPaul is very good for her,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI love Paul. They\u2019re like soul mates. He\u2019s her balancing rod. What she\u2019s not, he is. She pushes him, and he calms her down.\u201d Imani Boyette added that her husband was the stabilizing presence she had needed upon arriving at college at a time when her relationship with her mother was frayed. \u201cHe would be there to catch me as I was breaking down and angry, and the next day he\u2019d be like, \u2018You need to go fix it,\u2019 \u201d Boyette said. McGee and Boyette now text or talk about once a day, and McGee is planning to be at the draft, at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn. Before Boyette received an invitation to Thursday\u2019s W.N.B.A. draft (ESPN2, 7 p.m. Eastern), she said, she had not realized the significance of following in her mother\u2019s footsteps. Boyette \u2014 the first Texas women\u2019s player to collect 1,000 career points, 1,000 rebounds and 200 blocks \u2014 has also begun to visualize the expanded audience afforded to professional athletes. \u201cI definitely want to change the way we view mental health and the way we view sexual-abuse survivors, and I can\u2019t do that without a platform,\u201d Boyette said. \u201cWhile I\u2019d love to play in the W.N.B.A. because I love basketball \u2014 it\u2019s a great way to have a career \u2014 it\u2019s also very helpful for me to do things that I want to change the world.\u201d Last month, McGee traveled from her home in Virginia to watch Texas play in the N.C.A.A. women\u2019s basketball tournament in Bridgeport, Conn. Wearing stickers of the Longhorns logo on her cheeks, McGee watched Boyette, a center, collect 18 points and 10 rebounds to lead Texas to a 72-64 win over U.C.L.A. in the round of 16. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends now, more than just mother and daughter,\u201d McGee said. \u201cMore than just a basketball player, more than just a student, she\u2019s just a profound, deep person. I\u2019m just honored to be her mother.\u201d McGee, whose hair was dyed a hue resembling Texas burnt orange, kept her eyes fixed on Boyette, not necessarily where the ball traveled. She leaned forward in her seat, trying to peer over the shoulders of Thompson, who was selected first in the 1997 W.N.B.A. draft, just before McGee. Boyette credited Thompson with instilling the confidence that she could become a dominant offensive player. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t feel sorry for herself,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing. I wouldn\u2019t judge one bit if she did. She\u2019s been through an absolute lot, so she has the opportunity to say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve been through some things, give me a minute,\u2019 but she doesn\u2019t use that as a vice in order to not have to live up to her expectations.\u201d Watching Boyette\u2019s newfound offensive aggression, McGee pumped her fist after Boyette made two free throws to tie the score at 54-54 in the fourth quarter. Texas led from there on. When the buzzer sounded, McGee stood and doled out high-fives to the parents of other players sitting nearby. Boyette was interviewed on the court after the game by ESPN, and McGee pulled out her cellphone to capture the scene. Afterward, Boyette ran toward the tunnel but then took a step back and pivoted to McGee, whom she embraced with a hug and a kiss. \u201cMy mom has been so awesome during my college experience, mainly during the last two years when we kind of reconnected and built a better relationship,\u201d Boyette said. \u201cWe understand each other. \u201cI remember talking to my husband a couple of months ago, and I was like, \u2018Dude, if I wasn\u2019t such a little jerk my entire teenage life, I could have had this the entire time.\u2019 She\u2019s so awesome. It\u2019s unfortunate that I missed that time with her when I was younger. We just try to make up for lost time and be who we are in the moment. It\u2019s so exciting and fun to have her every step of the way.\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
