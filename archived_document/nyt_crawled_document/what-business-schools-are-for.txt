{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cBook Pins Corporate America\u2019s Greed on a Lust Bred at Harvard\u201d by Andrew Ross Sorkin (DealBook column, April 11), about questions raised by \u201cThe Golden Passport,\u201d a new book by Duff McDonald, on the history of Harvard Business School: The monumental problem is that business school leaders have forgotten why their institutions were founded: to advance the theory and practice of collective \u2014 not individual \u2014 wealth creation, using real-life conditions to gauge success. This remains the most visionary and worthy purpose put forth. Another big problem is, paradoxically, organization. It is almost impossible for business schools to articulate, execute and sustain a vision. This situation dates to the 1950s, when business schools abandoned the idea of a central focus and adopted a \u201ccore\u201d made up of several unrelated disciplines. The dominant forces are centrifugal, with a void in the center. ELLEN S. O\u2019CONNOR SANTA ROSA, CALIF.
