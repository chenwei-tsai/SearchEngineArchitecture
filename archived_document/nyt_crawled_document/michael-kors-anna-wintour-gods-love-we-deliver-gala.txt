{"text": "God\u2019s Love We Deliver held its fall gala on Monday night at Spring Studios, but the elephant in the room was the divisive presidential election. Anna Wintour, the night\u2019s chairwoman, was among the early arrivals. She posed on the red carpet in her Chanel sunglasses before darting off to a Hillary Clinton fund-raiser organized by the movie producer Harvey Weinstein and the theater magnate Jordan Roth. She was followed by the evening\u2019s M.C., Neil Patrick Harris, who wore a corduroy Marc Jacobs suit and was planning anti-Trump remarks. Then came Blaine Trump, a vice chairwoman of God\u2019s Love We Deliver, who was previously married to Robert Trump, Donald\u2019s brother. She attempted, like Switzerland, to remain neutral this election. But that turns out not to be so easy, even when she was surrounded by friends like the magazine editor Amy Astley, who noted that \u201cmost New Yorkers who know about Blaine Trump think God\u2019s Love We Deliver. They don\u2019t think Donald Trump.\u201d After all, when your last name is Trump and you show up to a room full of New York liberals, people are bound to ask about the election. \u201cI\u2019m speechless,\u201d Ms. Trump said, smiling her Julie Andrews-like smile, as guests like Iman and Kate Hudson made their way to the center table. \u201cDo you know where you\u2019re sitting?\u201d Moments later, Mr. Harris ascended to the lectern and began pillorying Ms. Trump\u2019s former brother-in-law. \u201cYou could have just stayed at home and watched the latest news cycle about Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll stay positive. The best thing about Donald Trump is \u2014 Alec Baldwin.\u201d The election eventually took a temporary back seat to the matter at hand, which was a steak dinner and an auction led by Jamie Niven, formerly of Sotheby\u2019s, to raise money for God\u2019s Love, which provides meals to vulnerable New Yorkers living with H.I.V. and other illnesses. A meal cooked by Mr. Harris and his husband, the chef David Burtka, went for $60,000, while a trip to San Francisco for a meal cooked by Alice Waters went for $50,000. Chrissy Teigen turned heads when she raised her hand and pledged $100,000. A few minutes later, Aerin Lauder, sitting nearby, pledged $25,000. The night also honored the model Karlie Kloss (who was in Japan and happens to be dating Joshua Kushner, the brother-in-law of Ivanka Trump), the restaurateur Danny Meyer and Wing Tat Leung, a volunteer who has logged more than 26,000 hours with God\u2019s Love. As the evening wound down around 10 p.m., and chocolate-covered strawberries were served, Ms. Trump was asked what she thought of Mr. Harris\u2019s speech, which included a suggestion that the Republican candidate change his campaign slogan to \u201cMake America Grope Again.\u201d \u201cI just sat there in silence,\u201d Ms. Trump said, laughing, before adding that she planned to skip the social circuit for the rest of the month to avoid the nagging political questions. \u201cI think it\u2019s just easier. Stay out of the fire.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/fashion/michael-kors-anna-wintour-gods-love-we-deliver-gala.html", "published_date": "2016-10-17T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T07:00:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T07:00:06-04:00", "abstract": "The event raised $2 million to help provide meals to vulnerable New Yorkers living with HIV and other illnesses.", "title": "Michael Kors, Anna Wintour, Kate Hudson and Blaine Trump at God\u2019s Love We Deliver Gala"}
