{"text": "The Republican plan to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something quite different might come up for a House vote in the next week, after an embarrassing false start in March. The bill, the American Health Care Act, has changed considerably since it was first introduced. Here\u2019s a refresher course to our coverage of what\u2019s inside it. Click the links for fuller stories on each subject. A set of proposed changes has won over most members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, which opposed the original G.O.P. bill. The compromise would allow states to waive three big Obamacare rules. \u25a0 The law\u2019s \u201cessential health benefits\u201d provision was devised to keep insurance to a minimum standard and make it useful for people who need it. \u25a0 Obamacare\u2019s \u201ccommunity rating\u201d provision helps protect people with pre-existing conditions from being charged more than healthy customers. \u25a0 Obamacare\u2019s \u201cage rating\u201d rule lowers premiums for older Americans, who tend to use more health care services \u2014 though it raises prices for younger customers. \u25a0 States that pursue waivers of these three rules would be required to set up special programs for high-cost patients. States have tried high-risk pools before, with mixed results. All of these changes would be added to the basic structure of the American Health Care Act, which reshapes the health insurance system.  \u25a0 The bill would change the federal-state Medicaid program for all its 74 million beneficiaries, not just those who joined because of Obamacare. \u25a0 It would rearrange the subsidy system that helps middle-income Americans buy their own insurance coverage, creating new winners and losers. We don\u2019t have an estimate of effects of the bill with the new changes, but we have some sense of the original bill\u2019s impact. \u25a0 The Congressional Budget Office says an older version of the bill would mean that 24 million more Americans would lack health insurance in a decade. \u25a0 In addition to the insurance changes, the bill would also make big tax cuts, particularly on income from investments. Taken together, the bill would redistribute resources from the poor to the rich. Those shifts can be summarized in a simple chart.
