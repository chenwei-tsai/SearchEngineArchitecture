{"abstract": "A ruling by a United States District Court judge cleared the way for an appearance by the white nationalist leader that had been canceled to go ahead.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "A federal judge, ruling on First Amendment grounds, cleared the way for the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer to speak at Auburn University on Tuesday night despite university objections. The event was expected to proceed at the university\u2019s Foy Auditorium under heavy security. Mr. Spencer had been scheduled to speak, but on Friday the university canceled a contract permitting use of the auditorium after students organized protests and organizations like the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice registered complaints. Mr. Spencer, the self-professed leader of the alt-right movement, suggests that people who are not white should leave the United States. His organization produces papers on issues such as racial differences in intelligence and the crime rate among Hispanic immigrants. In canceling the event, the university had raised concerns that the protests opposed to Mr. Spencer\u2019s ideology might result in violence or property damage. But on Tuesday, Judge W. Keith Watkins of United States District Court in Mongtomery, Ala., cleared the way for Mr. Spencer\u2019s presentation on constitutional grounds, ruling that there was no evidence that Mr. Spencer advocates violence. \u201cDiscrimination on the basis of message content cannot be tolerated under the First Amendment,\u201d the ruling said. In a statement posted online Tuesday afternoon, the university said the speech would proceed. \u201cIt is now more important than ever that we respond in a way that is peaceful, respectful, and maintains civil discourse,\u201d the statement said. Meanwhile, several groups, including the N.A.A.C.P., had organized a protest concert elsewhere on campus. \u201cStudents that were organizing the protest realized that it could get dangerous quickly and they organized a music event, a concert, in a different part of campus,\u201d said Victoria Siciliano, communications coordinator for the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Rights. \u201cSo the goal is to draw people away from that event and to overshadow it and to show what real solidarity and unity and diversity looks like.\u201d But Ms. Siciliano said that other protests were planned, as well, \u201cso I\u2019m not sure how this is gong to play out.\u201d After a speech last year at Texas A&M University, aides to Mr. Spencer had announced he would embark on a campus tour, but no schedule was announced. The auditorium at Auburn \u2014 which is available to the general public \u2014 was rented by an Atlanta-area Spencer supporter identified in court papers as Cameron Padgett. Mr. Spencer had taken university officials by surprise recently, announcing on his Twitter feed that he would be giving a speech there on Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/judge-rules-auburn-must-allow-richard-spencer-to-speak.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T19:30:45-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Judge Rules Auburn Must Allow Richard Spencer to Speak", "created_date": "2017-04-18T19:30:45-04:00", "section": "U.S."}
