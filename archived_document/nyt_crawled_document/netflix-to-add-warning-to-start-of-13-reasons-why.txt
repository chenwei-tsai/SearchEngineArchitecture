{"text": "Netflix will add a warning to the start of \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d its series about a teenager\u2019s suicide, as an extra precaution for viewers, the streaming network announced Monday. The move came after mounting criticism from mental health experts who say the show\u2019s portrayal of suicide is incorrect and potentially dangerous for vulnerable adolescents. On Tuesday, Netflix would not disclose what the newest warning will say. Episodes depicting rape or the suicide of the character Hannah Baker already had warnings, and the show is rated TV-MA. \u201cWhile many of our members find the show to be a valuable driver for starting important conversation with their families, we have also heard concern from those who feel the series should carry additional advisories,\u201d Netflix said in a statement on Monday that did not mention suicide. In recent weeks, school counselors recommended that students with a history of suicidal thoughts refrain from watching, for fear that the series may spur copycat behavior or self-injury. Netflix would not comment on whether the new advisory will suggest that adolescents with such a history should not watch \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/television/netflix-to-add-warning-to-start-of-13-reasons-why.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T16:04:00-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T16:04:00-04:00", "abstract": "The announcement came after mounting criticism from mental-health experts who say the show\u2019s portrayal of suicide is incorrect and potentially dangerous.", "title": "Netflix to Add Warning to Start of \u201813 Reasons Why\u2019"}
