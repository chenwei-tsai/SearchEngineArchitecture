DISPLACED PERSONS: MIGRATION ON FILM at Anthology Film Archives (April 29 through May 4). The experience of refugees \u2014 from Bosnia, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia \u2014 is the subject of this continent-bridging retrospective, presented in collaboration with the Goethe-Institut New York and the International Center of Photography. The series includes \u201cSite 2\u201d (Saturday and Sunday), directed by the Cambodian filmmaker Rithy Panh, whose films (\u201cThe Missing Picture,\u201d \u201cExile\u201d) often confront his personal experience of life under the Khmer Rouge. In \u201cSite 2,\u201d from 1989, he visits a sprawling refugee camp on the Thai-Cambodian border that has grown to the size of a small city.212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org FURTHER RESEARCH: HAROLD AND LILLIAN at the Quad Cinema (April 29-30). The new documentary \u201cHarold and Lillian: A Hollywood Love Story,\u201d opening on Friday, posits Harold and Lillian Michelson as a kind of unsung power couple in Hollywood. He was a storyboard illustrator and art director; she was a researcher. Both were highly sought after during a period of innovation in studio filmmaking, and their influence often went uncredited. This sidebar calls attention to some of their handiwork, including Mr. Michelson\u2019s drawings for \u201cThe Cotton Club\u201d (Saturday), Ms. Michelson\u2019s research for \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d (Sunday) and both of their contributions to Mel Brooks\u2019s \u201cHistory of the World, Part I\u201d (Saturday).quadcinema.com WOJCIECH HAS\u2019S \u2018THE NOOSE\u2019 AND \u2018HOW TO BE LOVED\u2019 at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 3) and \u2018THE SARAGOSSA MANUSCRIPT\u2019 at the Museum of the Moving Image (April 30). The Polish director Wojciech Has is probably best known in the United States for his adaptation of \u201cThe Saragossa Manuscript,\u201d showing on Sunday at the Museum of the Moving Image, which unfolds as a surreal series of stories within stories. Two films showing at MoMA reveal the director working in very different modes: \u201cThe Noose\u201d follows an alcoholic looking to get on the wagon, and in \u201cHow to Be Loved,\u201d an actress recalls sheltering an actor during World War II.212-708-9400, moma.org718-784-0077, movingimage.us \u2018WAKE IN FRIGHT\u2019 at Film Forum (May 1, 7 p.m.). On the way to a vacation with his girlfriend, a schoolteacher (Gary Bond) is stranded in the fictional Australian outback town of Bundanyabba, known to everyone as the Yabba, which he initially regards as a disgusting backwater. Plying him with one beer after another, the town\u2019s residents, almost all men, are eager to cure him of his prudishness, especially a town doctor (Donald Pleasence) who seems like just about the last person you would want to see scrubbing in for your surgery. The increasingly surreal goings-on come to a head in a horrifically visceral kangaroo hunt. The director, Ted Kotcheff, who went on to make \u201cFirst Blood\u201d and \u201cWeekend at Bernie\u2019s,\u201d will participate in a Q. and A.212-727-8110, filmforum.org", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/film-series-in-nyc-this-week.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T19:14:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T19:14:06-04:00", "abstract": "Our guide to film series and special screenings.", "title": "Film Series in NYC This Week"}
