Instead, after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s overwhelming defeat in New Hampshire by Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday, eight days after she barely won the Iowa caucuses, Nevada is looming as a turning point in their increasingly competitive contest, offering critical tests of the two candidates\u2019 strengths. After solid showings in two overwhelmingly white states, Mr. Sanders will have an opportunity to answer the central question for many Democrats trying to judge whether he is more than a particularly strong early-contest protest candidate. This state is as racially diverse as Iowa and New Hampshire are not: About 20 percent of the Democratic electorate is Hispanic, and 13 percent African-American. Over 95 percent of Vermont, his home state, is white. For Mrs. Clinton, Nevada offers a chance to put her campaign on solid footing after a staggering double-digit defeat in New Hampshire that stirred new concerns among Democrats about her political strengths. She opened her first office here last April, six months before Mr. Sanders. Her national campaign manager, Robby Mook, ran Nevada for Mrs. Clinton in 2008, when she narrowly won the popular vote, though in a quirk of Nevada caucus rules, lost the delegate vote. \u201cA month ago, who would have thought this would be such a competitive race?\u201d said Rebecca Lambe, the senior strategist for Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the minority leader. \u201cNevada will either be a potential firewall or a potential tiebreaker.\u201d \u201cIt really is the first test there is of how effective you are going to be in mobilizing the Democratic coalition in a general election,\u201d she said. Mr. Sanders\u2019s senior adviser, Tad Devine, said Monday that campaign workers from Iowa, where Mr. Sanders nearly tied Mrs. Clinton, were being flown into Nevada to beef up a 90-person operation already in place. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers declined to disclose the size of their paid staff here. Mr. Sanders began advertising here in early December; Mrs. Clinton began in early January. \u201cIt has become more competitive,\u201d Mr. Devine said. Nevada, he added, presents a \u201cfair test\u201d of Mr. Sanders\u2019s potential national appeal. \u201cNow we are moving into a different region in the country, a much more diverse group of voters.\u201d The campaign unfurling here heading into the Feb. 20 caucuses could be instructive for reasons that go beyond Mr. Sanders\u2019s ability to extend his demographic reach and the durability of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s second bid for the presidency. Few states endured the degree of economic turmoil that racked Nevada during the recession. Vast tracts of housing developments were abandoned as the mortgage foreclosure crisis sent new homeowners fleeing, unemployment soared into the double digits and projects on the Las Vegas Strip were abandoned. The economy has turned around to a large extent. But memories of that brutal time endure and could create a political environment ripe for Mr. Sanders: His campaign has seized on the issues of income disparity and Wall Street abuses in the television advertisements airing here, which proved powerful in New Hampshire. \u201cMy street, oh my God, almost every house on that block of 20 houses was hit,\u201d said Elizabeth Meinhold, 59, a Clark County high-school teacher who is supporting Mr. Sanders and said she believed Mrs. Clinton stood for \u201cthe establishment.\u201d \u201cWe need real change and real movement in this country. Too much money is in the hands of a few,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe last 40 years has been deregulation, tax cuts, Reaganism \u2014 it\u2019s a disaster in my opinion.\u201d Less attention has been paid so far by the Republican presidential candidates to their party\u2019s Nevada caucuses, which take place three days after the Democrats\u2019 contest. Instead, Republicans have been focusing on their South Carolina primary, which is on the same day as the Democratic caucuses here. Nevada is a relatively new battlefield for Democrats, but it will almost certainly be an important one in the general election. That there is little history to draw on, and that Nevada is a state of constantly shifting populations \u2014 people often come here seeking luck and opportunity, and leave if they find neither \u2014 means polling is scant and suspect. The caucuses were championed by Mr. Reid in 2008 to increase Nevada\u2019s influence in the nominating process, and to bolster its economy with the influx of campaign workers and journalists that comes with a competitive contest. In an interview, Mr. Reid said he was heartened that the Iowa and New Hampshire outcomes had heightened Nevada\u2019s importance, and argued that this was appropriate, given the state\u2019s diversity and interests. \u201cI am glad that we are not going to be overshadowed by what happens in New Hampshire and Iowa,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cWhy should a person\u2019s ability to run for president be determined by New Hampshire and Iowa? They are not representative of America.\u201d Mrs. Clinton has some noteworthy advantages. Her campaign is staffed by people steeped in Nevada politics, led by Mr. Mook, who is taking particular interest in the state. \u201cWe built this campaign, starting when she announced in April, to win a competitive primary,\u201d Mr. Mook said. \u201cThat means not taking anything for granted. That means building a real presence. Nevada is an important part of that strategy.\u201d And Bill Clinton is a popular figure here. \u201cIn Nevada, the one big guy in the room is Bill Clinton,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cHe comes all the time. He has very good friends there. He plays golf. So Bernie has a real problem there.\u201d When Mr. Clinton campaigned for his wife here on a chilly evening before the first votes were cast in Iowa, people lined up for hours to see him. \u201cLas Vegas has been good to us,\u201d Mr. Clinton told the crowd. \u201cNevada has been good to us. You voted for me twice. We are very grateful.\u201d Ron Nelsen, 60, the owner of a garage door company, said he had always supported the Clintons and planned to again on Feb. 20. \u201cI like her vision of the country and health care and lifelong expertise in government,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care was my issue when Bill Clinton was elected the first time.\u201d But, as in Iowa, Mr. Sanders has arrived with a boom that has discomfited the Clinton campaign, opening 11 offices in the state (compared with seven for Mrs. Clinton) and flooding television stations with advertisements. A recent debate-watching party was packed with supporters wearing red Sanders T-shirts. They cheered Mr. Sanders and hooted at Mrs. Clinton. When the lights came up during a commercial break, an organizer shouted: \u201cGet on Twitter everybody! Tweet, tweet, tweet!\u201d Nevada permits same-day voter registration, a matter of special concern to Mrs. Clinton since first-time caucusgoers flocked to Mr. Sanders in Iowa. And 30,000 Nevadans registered and voted on caucus day here in 2008, many of them brought in by Barack Obama. \u201cIn 2008, I worked in the Obama campaign and we saw a lot of young people involved,\u201d said Joan Kato, Mr. Sanders\u2019s Nevada state director, as college students sprawled on the floor of her campaign office, using cellphones to call voters. \u201cWe are seeing it again.\u201d Emmy Ruiz, who is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s state director, said the complexities involved in organizing for any caucus would pose a challenge for Mr. Sanders since he started late. \u201cYou cannot parachute in and run up the score in the caucus the same way you might be able to do in a primary,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what we have been preparing for.\u201d Representative Dina Titus, Democrat of Nevada, said she was confident that Mrs. Clinton, whom she supports, would be able to overcome a surge of new voters. Nevada remains \u201cClinton country,\u201d she said. Still, she said she was struck by the force of Mr. Sanders\u2019s presence. \u201cHe\u2019s making a race out of it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly going to get some votes.\u201d", "abstract": "After his defeat of Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday, Bernie Sanders will have a chance to prove himself in a state as racially diverse as Iowa and New Hampshire are not.", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T00:00:08-04:00", "title": "Stakes in Nevada Rise for Hillary Clinton as Caucuses Near", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/us/politics/nevada-looms-as-battleground-for-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders.html"}
