{"text": "One Friday night at a bar in San Francisco, I took a look at the menu and found myself face to face once again with the curious modern-day ubiquity of the Asian salad. The \u201cAsian Emperor Salad,\u201d with its \u201c31 ingredients representing the tastes, textures and flavors of Asia,\u201d stirred something other than hunger in me. I tried to identify exactly what that was. I made a halfhearted joke to my husband about just which Asian emperor this salad was honoring. I thought about its grand imprecision, which irritated me as a Chinese-American. And I wondered, who cooked up this thing? I was reasonably sure it wasn\u2019t anyone Asian, but I did some investigating to find out. In many American restaurants, the Asian salad is right up there next to the Greek salad and the Caesar salad. You might think this is progress \u2014 cultural inclusion on a menu. And yet the Asian salad is often the one that comes with a winky, jokey name: Oriental Chop Chop. Mr. Mao\u2019s. Secret Asian Man. Asian Emperor. China Island. Chicken Asian Chop Chop. Chinese-y Chicken. In the weird cultural geography of the casual-restaurant menu, half-century-old jokes about Asians and long-discarded terminology jostle up against chicken tenders and nacho plates. The persistence of these names \u2014 let\u2019s at least call them \u201cquestionable\u201d \u2014 on the American restaurant menu underscores how non-Asian-Americans have been making up their own version of Asianness for a long time now. While the Greek salad has some integrity \u2014 by this I mean that in Greece you will actually find a salad that looks like this \u2014 and the Caesar is a creation attributed to the 1920s-era restaurateur Caesar Cardini, the Asian salad stands apart as a strange kind of fiction. As early as 1906, top New York restaurants were serving something called \u201cOriental salad\u201d for 80 cents a pop, but it wasn\u2019t clear what distinguished it. As this paper\u2019s food critic observed that same year: \u201cYou could save on the salad. Oriental, Russian and mixed salads are nearly all the same thing.\u201d Recipes for \u201cChinese chicken salad\u201d started appearing in American newspapers in the \u201930s, but their components ranged far and wide, from mayonnaise and gelatin to pineapple chunks and celery and, in one case, French dressing. At the time, it seemed that \u201cChinese\u201d was merely a synonym for \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cdifferent.\u201d The tie to Chinese cuisine was already weak, since people in China did not generally eat uncooked vegetables; more common were cold chicken dishes with the vegetables blanched or stir-fried. In 1960s America, with the lifting of the cap on immigration from Asia, dressings using actual ingredients from Chinese cooking \u2014 sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger \u2014 entered the rotation. Chinese chicken salad grew popular. Pretty soon there were competing claims of origin. By the \u201980s, \u201cAsian fusion\u201d was the name applied to what high-minded chefs like Wolfgang Puck, Roy Yamaguchi and Jean-Georges Vongerichten were doing with the marriage of traditional Asian and French ingredients. Mr. Puck\u2019s restaurant Chinois on Main, in Santa Monica, Calif., was credited with pioneering fusion cuisine in the United States. One of his most popular dishes is the Chinois chicken salad: it features a sesame-soy-mustard vinaigrette, Napa cabbage, romaine lettuce and shredded roast chicken. Mr. Puck himself resisted reductive terms for his cooking \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as adding ginger and soy sauce \u2014 and voil\u00e0, Asian fusion,\u201d he told The Huffington Post \u2014 but that is, in fact, what happened. When the Asian salad fad exploded, something that was cooked up by non-Asians became, well, \u201cAsian\u201d in the popular imagination. A single Cheesecake Factory, Rainforest Cafe or Applebee\u2019s could sell 500 Asian salads a week. Each chain punched up the name to seem foreign yet familiar. So what\u2019s my problem with Asian salad? It\u2019s not the salad itself, though it\u2019s not my favorite. It\u2019s the words \u2014 which, I think, matter. In many ways, the broad, generic terminology used to refer to an entire continent is the heart of it. Applebee\u2019s menu features an \u201cOriental chicken salad\u201d with the following description: \u201cfresh Asian greens tossed in a tasty Oriental vinaigrette.\u201d The \u201cAsian greens\u201d and \u201cOriental vinaigrette\u201d are so laughably vague as to have no meaning at all. When I asked Applebee\u2019s for more specifics on what made its Asian greens Asian and its Oriental vinaigrette Oriental, a spokesman told me the company was unable to \u201cprovide a thorough response.\u201d No kidding. Am I taking this too seriously? The casual racism of the Asian salad stems from the idea of the exotic \u2014 who is and isn\u2019t American is caught up wholesale in its creation. This use of \u201cOriental\u201d and \u201cAsian\u201d is rooted in the wide-ranging, \u201call look same\u201d stereotypes of Asian culture that most people don\u2019t really perceive as being racist. It creates a kind of blind spot. And what I\u2019ve come to understand is that the salad names are where that blind spot reveals itself. Even as the actual cuisines of Asia influence and sometimes appear to dominate American food culture \u2014 David Chang\u2019s Momofuku restaurants, Roy Choi\u2019s Kogi barbecue-fueled empire, ramen joints and izakaya and Mission Chinese Food by Danny Bowien \u2014 these stereotypes persist and control a lot of what\u2019s on the menu in Middle America. In the ecosystem of the American restaurant menu, the dish checks a box for geographic and flavor diversity outside what company marketers understand to be the norm for their customers. To a white audience, it reads as diverse. To actual Asian-Americans, it reads as ridiculous. The blindness to this reality, I emphasize, is not restricted to the Asian salad (see Applebee\u2019s \u201cFiesta lime chicken,\u201d served with \u201cMexi-ranch\u201d dressing). When I see an Oriental Chop Chop or a Secret Asian Man, I feel \u2026 weary. Because the language of the Asian salad is revealing of the dangers of bland, disembodied generalization: When you fail to see countries and cultures as discrete entities, what kind of consideration could you be expected to give to individual people? As for the dish itself \u2014 whether it\u2019s called Asian, Chinese or Oriental \u2014 well, it\u2019s acquired a life of its own, apart from actual Asians. The other day I tried a version of a \u201cChinese chicken salad\u201d made by Wise Sons, a Jewish deli in San Francisco. The owners, Evan Bloom and Leo Beckerman, are two guys from Southern California who grew up eating Chinese chicken salad just about everywhere. Mr. Bloom\u2019s early exposure to it? Wolfgang Puck. The salad has become a nostalgia trip for a whole generation of Jewish deli-goers. Mr. Bloom says that the recipe came from nowhere in particular. Sesame oil, soy sauce, mayo, sugar, sesame seeds; Napa cabbage, red cabbage, fris\u00e9e, red onions, shredded carrots, thin sliced celery, chopped sushi ginger, orange segments, fried wonton skins, a little cilantro. It\u2019s a riff on an idea, what Mr. Bloom himself tells me is \u201cthat sweet Asiany flavor that is a familiar taste to a lot of people, from Benihana or a Chinese restaurant \u2014 it\u2019s been around for 30 years.\u201d I find something bittersweet in this nostalgia for a fake fusion cuisine. Something created in the name of Asians by non-Asians has become a touchstone for non-Asians. I understand that it\u2019s possible to feel fondness for a dish that is deeply inauthentic and I don\u2019t resent that one bit. It has become its own thing. Just don\u2019t call it Mr. Mao\u2019s Chicken Surprise.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/sunday/why-is-asian-salad-still-on-the-menu.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T15:40:09-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-04-27T15:40:09-04:00", "abstract": "The casual racism of \u201cOriental Chop Chop\u201c or \u201cSecret Asian Man\u201c tells us a lot about who we think is authentically American.", "title": "Why Is Asian Salad Still on the Menu?"}
