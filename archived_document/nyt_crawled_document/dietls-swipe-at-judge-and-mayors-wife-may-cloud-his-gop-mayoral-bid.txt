{"text": "For one night, for two hours at least, Republicans appeared giddy over their prospects in the New York City mayoral race. There was laughter. There were jabs at Mayor Bill de Blasio. And there was a palpable sense that despite a daunting Democratic registration advantage, the underdog party \u2014 so powerful in Washington but so much less so in New York \u2014 could retake City Hall. But then, toward then toward the end of a Republican candidate forum on Wednesday, Bo Dietl, a former homicide detective who is seeking a waiver to run in the party\u2019s mayoral primary, delivered his closing remarks. Mr. Dietl, who gravitates toward the off the cuff, told of going to court to try to correct a voter registration error that had left him without a party affiliation. \u201cThe judge looked like Charlene de Blasio,\u201d he said, referring to the mayor\u2019s wife, Chirlane McCray. The judge, Debra A. James, and Ms. McCray are both black. \u201cAs soon as I saw her,\u201d Mr. Dietl continued, \u201cI knew I had a problem.\u201d Mr. Dietl had a problem, though not the one he thought he had: His comments ricocheted across social media and through political circles, forcing him to try to explain his remarks in a radio interview, on Twitter and in a campaign email with the subject line, \u201cBO DIETL: I AM NOT RACIST!!\u201d His comments came during a forum at the Metropolitan Republican Club, on East 83rd Street, that also included the Rev. Michel J. Faulkner, a Harlem pastor and former member of the New York Jets; Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who represents parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn; and Paul J. Massey Jr., a wealthy real estate sales executive. Much was said during the event to disparage Mr. de Blasio, who, according to all who spoke, has put New York on a potholed road to ruin. Two candidates, Mr. Dietl and Mr. Faulkner, denounced the scourge of public urination, objecting to a new law signed by Mr. de Blasio that, in most cases, treats the act as a civil offense rather than a crime. The candidates also railed against about homelessness, bike lanes and excessive government spending. About 200 attendees filled the hall past its seating capacity, but the true audience comprised just five people: the Republican county leaders from the city\u2019s five boroughs. They will decide whether to choose one candidate as the party\u2019s standard-bearer in hopes of avoiding a costly and potentially damaging primary, or to embrace the contest and see who emerges victorious. Party leaders must decide whether Mr. Dietl should get a special pass, called a Wilson-Pakula certification, that allows him to run in the primary even though he is not currently registered as a Republican. The occasionally raucous forum energized Republican leaders and, with no candidate appearing to rise above the others, seemed to increase the chances of a primary. Mr. Massey, who sat for most of the time after a recent hip-replacement surgery, emphasized his personal wealth and his ability to raise money. Where his rivals gesticulated, ranted or engaged in other displays of emotion, Mr. Massey spoke in measured tones. But people in the hall took notice when he rapped loudly and dramatically on a table three times with the silvery handle of his cane. \u201cIt\u2019s opportunity knocking,\u201d he said, explaining in a modulated tone that Mr. de Blasio was vulnerable and that he was the only candidate qualified to answer that knock. Ms. Malliotakis, who is the daughter of a Cuban mother and a Greek father and who speaks a bit of Spanish, told the crowd that she could bring crossover votes from Democratic women and Hispanics. \u201cThe bottom line is that this race up till now has been quite dull,\u201d she said, adding that she would inject passion into the campaign. Mr. Faulkner was earnest and urgent. As the only black candidate, and one of about a dozen African-Americans in the hall, he said that he could appeal to minority voters. \u201cThe elephant in the room, well, I\u2019m the elephant in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cThe elephant in the room is that the African-American and Latino voting block represents 53 percent.\u201d Mr. Dietl, who sometimes swears, mangles the English language and plays up his coarseness, got the biggest rise from the crowd with his microphone-popping oratory, which tends to veer from outraged to apoplectic. \u201cAll I wanna do is run for friggin\u2019 mayor,\u201d he said. But he may have damaged his chances when he told the story of how, although a lifetime Republican \u2014 \u201cHow many of you guys sat in the Oval Office with Ronald Reagan for 15 minutes?\u201d he asked his fellow candidates \u2014 he had sought to become a Democrat last year in order to take on Mr. de Blasio in a Democratic primary. But he made a mistake in completing his registration form and ended up registered to no party at all. He then described how he went to State Supreme Court to challenge his unaffiliated status \u2014 and made the comparison between the mayor\u2019s wife and Judge James. After the forum, Mr. Faulkner said he had interpreted Mr. Dietl\u2019s remark as a reference to race. \u201cI find it offensive,\u201d Mr. Faulkner said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to attack Bo and call him a racist, but some of his unhinged comments are unacceptable.\u201d Mr. Massey and Ms. Malliotakis also condemned the remark on Thursday. Mr. Massey characterized it in a news release as racist, and Ms. Malliotakis said in an interview that it was \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d Adele Malpass, the chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party and the moderator of the event on Wednesday, declined to address Mr. Dietl\u2019s comment directly, as did party leaders in Brooklyn and Staten Island. Bob Turner, the Queens Republican chairman, was more critical. \u201cI have said all along that we have enough Republicans legitimately in the race and Mr. Dietl is not a registered Republican, which would disqualify him without a waiver,\u201d said Mr. Turner, who has indicated his support for Mr. Massey. Mr. Turner said that party county leaders would meet over the next week to discuss the Wilson-Pakula certification. \u201cThe longer we wait, the weaker we are and the more problems it creates,\u201d he said, refusing to directly address Mr. Dietl\u2019s comments. \u201cI want to ignore them,\u201d he said, \u201cand let them speak for themselves.\u201d Judge James did not return a call on Thursday. In a radio interview on WNYC, Mr. Dietl defended his remark, saying that the judge \u201clooked very similar\u201d to the mayor\u2019s wife. \u201cShe looked kind of like her sister and she looked like she could have been part of her family,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think I have one racist cell in me then you don\u2019t know Bo Dietl,\u201d he added. \u201cThere was never ever intention to be any kind of racist remark.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/dietls-swipe-at-judge-and-mayors-wife-may-cloud-his-gop-mayoral-bid.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:36:33-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:36:33-04:00", "abstract": "Bo Dietl, who hopes to run for mayor as a Republican, defended himself against accusations of racism after saying he knew he \u201chad a problem\u201d with a black judge in a court case.", "title": "Dietl\u2019s Swipe at Judge and Mayor\u2019s Wife May Cloud His G.O.P.
