And \u201cMary Kills People\u201d adds some much-needed dark humor to a doctor\u2019s undercover end-of-life mission. EL CHAPO 8 p.m. on Univision. Marco de la O portrays the notorious Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n Loera across three decades \u2014 from 1985, when he was a low-ranking member of the Guadalajara Cartel, through his rise to power and his ultimate downfall, and all the tunnel-burrowing and prison escapes in between. (Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was recaptured and extradited to the United States, where he is currently being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan.) This first collaboration between Univision and Netflix will be broadcast in Spanish (with English close-captioning available) in three separate cycles before streaming on Netflix at a later date.  SHOPGIRL (2005) 6 p.m. on Flix. A down-on-his-luck stencil artist (Jason Schwartzman) and an older millionaire (Steve Martin, who adapted the screenplay from his novella) compete for the attention of a lonely saleswoman (Claire Danes) in Beverly Hills. \u201cAs it relates the delicate, almost anecdotal story of a young woman looking for love in modern Los Angeles, the movie reveals what is missing from most others of its kind: the fact of sex and the possibility of heartbreak, which is to say the very conditions of romance itself,\u201d A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. None of the characters in this \u201cresolutely small movie\u201d are perfect, he added. \u201cFrom where I sit, though, the film they inhabit comes pretty close.\u201d NEW YORK PRISON BREAK: THE SEDUCTION OF JOYCE MITCHELL (2017) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Penelope Miller stars in this ripped-from-the-headlines movie about Ms. Mitchell, the prison tailor who helped the convicted murderers Richard Matt (Myk Watford) and David Sweat (Joe Anderson) escape from the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York in the summer of 2015 \u2014 but then failed to pick them up after deciding she couldn\u2019t go through with the plot \u2014 leading to a massive manhunt. At 10, the Canadian series \u201cMary Kills People\u201d makes its American debut, with Caroline Dhavernas (\u201cHannibal\u201d) as Mary Harris, a brilliant emergency-room surgeon by day who \u2014 with the help of her smart-mouthed plastic-surgeon partner, Des (Richard Short) \u2014 transforms into an angel of death for the terminally ill by night. \u201cWhat makes the show different is the dark comedy of Mary and Des\u2019s missions,\u201d Mike Hale wrote in The Times, calling a jolting scene that morphs from somber to slapstick when the drugs don\u2019t work \u201ca smart decision.\u201d FEUD: BETTE AND JOAN  10 p.m. on FX. The catfight comes to an end as Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) and Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) put \u201cWhatever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d behind them and confront the rest of their careers. For Joan, that means failing health and a starring role in a B-movie about a caveman. For Bette, it\u2019s the realization that perhaps she and Joan could have been friends after all.", "title": "What\u2019s on TV Sunday: \u2018El Chapo\u2019 and \u2018Mary Kills People\u2019", "item_type": "Article", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday-el-chapo-and-mary-kills-people.html"}
