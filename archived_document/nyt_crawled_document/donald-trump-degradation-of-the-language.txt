{"text": "One of the more pernicious and insidious effects of the Donald Trump regime may well be the damage he does to language itself. Trumpian language is a thing unto itself: some manner of sophistry peppered with superlatives. It is a way of speech that defies the Reed-Kellogg sentence diagram. It is a jumble of incomplete thoughts stitched together with arrogance and ignorance. America is suffering under the tyranny of gibberish spouted by the lord of his faithful 46 percent. As researchers at Carnegie Mellon pointed out last spring, presidential candidates in general use \u201cwords and grammar typical of students in grades 6-8, though Donald Trump tends to lag behind the others.\u201d Indeed, among the presidents in the university\u2019s analysis, Trump\u2019s vocabulary usage was the lowest and his grammatical usage was only better than one president: George W. Bush. Trump\u2019s employment of reduced rhetoric is not without precedent and is in fact a well-documented tool of history\u2019s strongmen. As New York Times C.E.O. Mark Thompson noted about one of Trump\u2019s speeches in his 2016 book, \u201cEnough Said: What\u2019s Gone Wrong with the Language of Politics?\u201d: \u201cThe super-short sentences emphasize certainty and determination, build up layer upon layer, like bricks in a wall themselves, toward a conclusion and an emotional climax. It\u2019s a style that students of rhetoric call parataxis. This is the way generals and dictators have always spoken to distinguish themselves from the caviling civilians they mean to sweep aside.\u201d Thompson also notes that \u201cTrump\u2019s appeal as a presidential candidate depends significantly on the belief that he is a truth-teller who will have nothing to do with the conventional language of politics,\u201d warning that: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t confuse anti-rhetorical \u2018truth telling\u2019 with actually telling the truth. One of the advantages of this positioning is that once listeners are convinced that you\u2019re not trying to deceive them in the manner of a regular politician, they may switch off the critical faculties they usually apply to political speech and forgive you any amount of exaggeration, contradiction, or offensiveness. And if establishment rivals or the media criticize you, your supporters may dismiss that as spin.\u201d Here is the great danger: Many people expect a political lie to sound slick, to be delivered by intellectual elites spouting $5 words. A clumsy, folksy lie delivered by a shyster using broken English reads as truth. It is an upside-down world in which easy lies sound more true than hard facts. But this is what comes from a man who is more watcher than reader, a man more driven by the limelight than by literature. In January, Vanity Fair attempted to answer the question: \u201cExactly How Much TV Does Donald Trump Watch in a Day?\u201d They did so by producing this utterly frightening roundup: \u201cEarly on in the campaign, Trump told Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he gets military advice from TV pundits. He couldn\u2019t get through a 50-minute Washington Post interview without repeatedly looking at the TV and commenting about what was on it. In November, during the transition, The Post noted that, based on his biography, \u2018He watches enormous amounts of television all through the night.\u2019 And just this week, a source told Politico that Trump\u2019s aides are being forced to try and curb some of his \u2018worst impulses\u2019 \u2014 including TV-watching, apparently: \u2018He gets bored and likes to watch TV \u2026 so it is important to minimize that.\u2019\u201d A piece in The New York Times in the first week of Trump\u2019s presidency noted: \u201cStill, Mr. Trump, who does not read books, is able to end his evenings with plenty of television.\u201d Trump has the intellectual depth of a coat of paint. At no time is this more devastatingly obvious than when he grants interviews to print reporters, when he is not protected by the comfort of a script and is not animated by the dazzling glare of television lights. In these moments, all he has is language, and his absolute ineptitude and possibly even lack of comprehension is enormously obvious. In the last month, Trump has given interviews to print reporters at The Times, The Associated Press, Reuters and The Wall Street Journal. Read together, the transcripts paint a terrifying portrait of a man who is simultaneously unintelligible in his delivery, self-assured in his ignorance and consciously bathing in his narcissism. In Trump world, facts don\u2019t matter, truth doesn\u2019t matter, language doesn\u2019t matter. Passionate performance is the only ideal. A lie forcefully told and often repeated is better than truth \u2014 it is accepted as an act of faith, which is better than a point of fact. This is one of the most heinous acts of this man: the mugging of the meaning, the disassembling of rhetoric until certainty is stripped away from truth like flesh from a carcass.
