{"text": "The official rationale for AT&T\u2019s $85 billion deal to purchase Time Warner is that in uncertain times, bigger is better. AT&T is a telecom company that offers wireless service in a saturated market, while Time Warner is a content company whose primary assets, networks like CNN and HBO, face tougher times in a cord-cutting world. This merger is presented as a solution \u2014 a bigger company with more options will inherently be better suited to weather the enormous changes now shattering the TV business. Together, they\u2019ll have more leverage and can build new stuff faster. If all this sounds a bit speculative, that\u2019s because it is. What this deal actually symbolizes is that the future of television is increasingly going to be built on lots of bold, possibly speculative experiments. In most mergers, people talk up \u201csynergies\u201d \u2014 how bringing various parts together creates a more valuable whole. But for regulatory reasons and business ones, the obvious synergies between AT&T and Time Warner are limited. For instance, it does not make sense for Time Warner to offer most of its content exclusively to AT&T\u2019s customers. Not only would that destroy its profitability (Comcast\u2019s customers pay a lot for CNN and HBO, so why would Time Warner want to kill that business?), but it would also be out of step with the future. The notion of content tied to specific distribution lines is exactly what consumers are moving away from when they choose services like Netflix over cable bundles. Instead this megadeal is best seen as a Hail Mary pass. It\u2019s a way to do something, anything, to get some grip on a rapidly changing future. The basic story underlying this merger is that the great delivery and content business for television is cracking up. Thanks to the internet and the smartphone, the way we have paid for TV, the kinds of programming we get and the devices we watch it on are all undergoing transformational change. We are witnessing the emergence of a new order in the TV business. In five or 10 years\u2019 time, that order may become clear. There\u2019s a good chance it will involve some current players \u2014 Comcast, Disney and a merged AT&T and Time Warner will all play a role in the entertainment business of tomorrow. But these behemoths\u2019 size and influence will almost certainly be diminished by new tech-powered players, whose pocketbooks and ambitions seem limitless \u2014 companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and possibly Twitter and Snap. What\u2019s scary for the incumbents is that at the moment, much of the future seems up for grabs, because consumer behavior is neither settled nor predictable. Even viewership of N.F.L. games is down this season. Down! So among the questions now plaguing the industry: Do people still want to pay for TV, and if so, how much? Do people want to watch live stuff, or scripted stuff, or do they instead want to watch whatever is on their Facebook feed? Which kind of company is the most valuable player in the future of the entertainment business? That is where all the experimenting comes in. William Goldman, the screenwriter, once said that in Hollywood, \u201cnobody knows anything.\u201d This applies well to the entertainment business of today, and the AT&T and Time Warner deal is perhaps the watershed example: Every move is a guess, and if you are lucky, an educated one. \u201cI think we\u2019re all trying to figure this out \u2014 how technology and the consumer is going to change, and who are the winners and losers in this future,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, who studies the telecommunications industry at the research firm BTIG. The best argument for the deal, Mr. Piecyk said, is that it diversifies AT&T\u2019s offerings \u2014 now a single company combines content and distribution, rather than just one or the other. When you face an uncertain future, diversity isn\u2019t a bad weapon. If it turns out that in the future, content becomes more valuable than distribution, the new AT&T will have that; if the opposite happens, it\u2019s covered there, too. In conference calls with reporters and investors over the weekend, Randall Stephenson and Jeffrey Bewkes, the chairmen and chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner, added another dimension to this argument: Bigger, they said, is faster. The future of TV, they argued, will depend on a lot of new ideas that are tested and deployed very quickly. These might include new business models for paying for shows, new ways to distribute and market that content, and new technologies and industrywide standards to make sure it all works. But today, those kinds of innovations take a long time to develop, in part because the industry is so fragmented, the companies argued. Consider TV Everywhere, the standard that allows you to sign on to your cable company\u2019s account so that you can watch, say, CNN or HBO on your smartphone. Mr. Bewkes pointed out Time Warner and others in the industry had been trying to pull off such a system for years, but that it took forever because other cable and content companies \u201ckept it hostage to individual negotiations and step-by-step contract renewals.\u201d Fragmentation led to delays, and delays contribute to consumer dissatisfaction \u2014 but in a world in which Time Warner and AT&T worked together, new products would come along faster, which would in turn push new ideas from competitors, Mr. Bewkes said. Many analysts I spoke to found this explanation hard to swallow. They said a lot of these potential products and services could be created from licensing deals. A merger might actually slow down industrywide collaborations, they argued, because it sets up a new giant that others in the industry may not want to work with. \u201cThis appears to be about empire sustenance rather than economic efficiency,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at the Pivotal Research Group. Craig Moffett, of MoffettNathanson, was blunter: \u201cAT&T faces the twin pressures of a huge debt load and huge dividend that consumes the vast majority of their cash,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIt is clear that they had to do SOMETHING.\u201d Big media mergers are always risky. They rarely work out. But it\u2019s striking how much more things are uncertain today than in the past. So even if AT&T and Time Warner together do not make much obvious sense, well, it\u2019s something.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/technology/att-time-warner-deal-is-a-strike-in-the-dark.html", "published_date": "2016-10-23T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Technology", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T03:00:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T03:00:06-04:00", "abstract": "AT&T\u2019s $85 billion deal for Time Warner is a ploy to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 in the face of a rapidly changing media landscape.", "title": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Is a Shot in the Dark"}
