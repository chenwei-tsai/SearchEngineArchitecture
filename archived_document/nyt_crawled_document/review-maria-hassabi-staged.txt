Somehow, by placing her dancers in a landscape of stationary art and normal people moving at a normal pace, her work gained greater intensity. Few of her theatrical endeavors exploring sculptural slowness, including her latest, have felt as satisfying. On Tuesday, Ms. Hassabi returned to the Kitchen for the premiere of \u201cStaged\u201d \u2014 presented by the Kitchen and the Crossing the Line Festival \u2014 a work for Simon Courchel, Hristoula Harakas, Oisin Monaghan and herself. As usual, it is a group of beautiful people inhabiting a beautiful space. The floor is covered in carpet, which at first looks red and, as the piece goes on, seemed to transform into a rosy pink. The audience surrounds the performers as the lighting, by Zack Tinkelman and Ms. Hassabi, brightens and dims throughout. Dancers, lounging on the carpet, move incrementally: Stretching out an arm, rising to sit and then melting onto the floor, they merge into one form before disengaging. Ms. Hassabi\u2019s work, to its detriment, can feel like a fashion shoot, and this one, especially, blurs the line between fashion and art. Wearing clashing prints and pointed white loafers \u2014 the on-trend \u201coutfit design\u201d is credited to Victoria Bartlett \u2014 \u201cStaged\u201d could have been called \u201cRunway.\u201d While there is beauty, there is too little risk. At best, \u201cStaged\u201d reveals the effort and commitment to Ms. Hassabi\u2019s physical practice, which we witness in quivering flesh. But what does it build to? There\u2019s a rawness missing in \u201cStaged.\u201d After the final blackout, the lights return as Ms. Hassabi and her dancers stay in position, and the audience files out. On Tuesday, as they struggled to remain frozen, their eyes watered. I wanted it to be haunting, but it felt like just another look.", "section": "Arts", "title": "Review: Maria Hassabi\u2019s \u2018Staged\u2019 Might Have a Better Title as \u2018Runway\u2019", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/arts/dance/review-maria-hassabi-staged.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T07:00:18-04:00", "published_date": "2016-10-04T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T07:00:10-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "item_type": "Article"}
