{"text": "HONG KONG \u2014 The Hong Kong police arrested nine pro-democracy activists on Thursday, adding to a recent crackdown said to be aimed at defanging opposition protests ahead of an expected visit by President Xi Jinping of China in July. \u201cThey want to silence the opposition and discourage the general public from participating in protests,\u201d said Avery Ng, chairman of the League of Social Democrats and one of the nine people arrested over their roles in a November protest against China\u2019s move to block  two separatists from taking office as local legislators. The arrests on Thursday followed a series of recent legal actions against opposition politicians and protest organizers in Hong Kong, a former British colony, and came just two months before the 20th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule, when President Xi is expected to visit the semiautonomous territory. Pro-democracy groups are planning large protests against what they see as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the city\u2019s freedom, supposedly guaranteed under an arrangement known as \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d The groups have increasingly called for greater autonomy, if not independence, from China. On Wednesday, two pro-independence politicians, Yau Wai-ching and Sixtus Leung, and three of their assistants were charged over their attempt to enter Hong Kong\u2019s legislative chamber after it refused to swear them in because they inserted anti-China snubs into their oaths of office. Last month, the Hong Kong authorities brought criminal charges against nine other protest organizers, including the three founders of the huge protests in 2014 that paralyzed streets in several parts of the city for weeks. \u201cThe Hong Kong government is trying to prove that everything is under control before Xi Jinping\u2019s visit and avoid large-scale protests by targeting active organizers,\u201d said Joshua Wong, who during the 2014 protests became the teenage face of Hong Kong\u2019s resistance to Chinese encroachment on its freedoms. The nine arrested on Thursday, including two members of Mr. Wong\u2019s party, Demosisto, face charges including unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct in public, they told reporters after they were released on bail Thursday afternoon. The Hong Kong police could not immediately confirm the charges. Mr. Wong said his party was planning to stage a \u201clarge civil disobedience protest\u201d on July 1, which could embarrass President Xi, as he is expected to participate in celebratory events as well as swear in the next chief executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, a longtime civil servant trusted by Beijing. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a greater challenge,\u201d Mr. Wong said, but \u201cwe will not back down.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-arrests-china.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T06:34:32-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T06:34:32-04:00", "abstract": "Pro-democracy activists said the arrests were part of a recent crackdown intended to quell protests before an expected July visit by President Xi Jinping of China.", "title": "Hong Kong Protest Organizers Arrested Ahead of Expected Visit by China\u2019s President"}
