{"text": "GENEVA \u2014 Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al Sabah of Kuwait, a powerful power broker in soccer and the Olympic movement, resigned from his post on FIFA\u2019s governing council and said he was resigning from all his soccer roles under pressure from allegations in a United States federal court that he bribed Asian officials. Sheikh Ahmad said Sunday in a statement he would withdraw from a May 8 election in Bahrain for the FIFA seat representing Asia, which he currently holds. \u201cI do not want these allegations to create divisions or distract attention from the upcoming A.F.C. and FIFA Congresses,\u201d he said, referring to the Asian Football Confederation, which governs the sport on that continent. Sheikh Ahmad, the longtime Olympic Council of Asia president, contacted the ethics panels of FIFA and the International Olympic Committee after the allegations were made in Brooklyn federal court on Thursday. He has denied any wrongdoing. FIFA President Gianni Infantino said he had \u201ctaken note\u201d of the Sheikh Ahmad\u2019s decision to resign from FIFA, adding in a brief statement, \u201cI want to thank him for taking this decision which certainly was not easy to take but is in the best interest for FIFA.\u201d The current case involves the FIFA audit and compliance committee member Richard Lai, an American citizen from Guam, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy charges related to taking around $1 million in bribes, including from Kuwaiti officials. The cash was to buy influence and help recruit other Asian soccer officials prepared to take bribes, Lai admitted in court. FIFA said Friday that it had provisionally banned Lai from the sport pending a broader ethics review. Sheikh Ahmad resigned his candidacy ahead of a FIFA panel deciding whether to remove him on ethical grounds. The FIFA Review Committee, which rules on the integrity of people seeking senior FIFA positions, has been studying his candidacy since the allegations emerged, The Associated Press reported on Saturday. The FIFA ethics committee is making a separate assessment of whether to provisionally suspend the Sheikh Ahmad, a longtime leader of Kuwait\u2019s soccer federation who was elected to FIFA\u2019s ruling committee in 2015. Resigning from his soccer positions does not necessarily put Sheikh Ahmad out of reach of FIFA ethics prosecutors and judges if any action is warranted. In 2012, the former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar was banned for life by the ethics committee days after he resigned. Bin Hammam was also clearly identified in Lai\u2019s court hearing for having paid Lai a total of $100,000 in bribes to support Bin Hammam\u2019s failed challenge to FIFA\u2019s then-president Sepp Blatter in 2011. Bin Hammam was removed from that election contest amid accusations that he had bribed Caribbean soccer officials. Sheikh Ahmad has also contacted the I.O.C.\u2019s ethics commission about the allegations against him, the I.O.C. said Saturday. As president since 2012 of the global group of national Olympic bodies, known as ANOC, Sheikh Ahmad\u2019s support has often been cited as key to winning Olympic election and hosting awards. He was widely credited for helping Thomas Bach win the I.O.C. presidency in 2013. Although Sheikh Ahmad was not named in Department of Justice and court documents last week, he has become one of the most significant casualties of the sprawling United States investigation of bribery and corruption in international soccer that began with a wave of arrests in Zurich two years ago. Sheikh Ahmad could be identified in a transcript of Lai\u2019s court hearing which said \u201cco-conspirator #2 was also the president of Olympic Council of Asia.\u201d Sheikh Ahmad has been O.C.A. president since 1991. Lai admitted that he agreed to help recruit other Asian officials that voted in FIFA elections who would help Kuwait\u2019s interests. The Guam soccer federation leader since 2001, Lai pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy charges and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. He agreed to pay more than $1.1 million in forfeiture and penalties, and will be sentenced at a later date. The American federal investigation of corruption linked to FIFA has indicted or taken guilty pleas from more than 40 people and marketing agencies linked to soccer in the Americas since 2015. Lai\u2019s case marked the first major step into Asia, and it suggested other soccer officials potentially recruited by the Kuwait faction could be targeted. The Asian election for FIFA seats on May 8 in Manama, Bahrain, is the same day as a FIFA Council meeting that Sheikh Ahmad will not attend. The FIFA congress will be held in the city three days later. The United States Soccer Federation and its partners from Canada and Mexico are hoping to emerge from that congress with an exclusive bidding window to make their case for hosting the 2026 World Cup.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/sports/soccer/kuwaiti-sheikh-resigns-fifa-investigation.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T11:22:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T11:22:54-04:00", "abstract": "Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al Sabah of Kuwait, a power broker in soccer and the Olympic movement, said he would quit amid allegations that he bribed Asian officials.", "title": "Kuwaiti Sheikh Resigns FIFA Role Amid Investigation"}
