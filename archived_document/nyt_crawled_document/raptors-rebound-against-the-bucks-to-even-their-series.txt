Kyle Lowry had 14 of his 18 points in the second half for the Raptors, who turned up their intensity on the road after having been embarrassed in a 27-point loss to the Bucks in Game 3. DeRozan went 12 of 22 from the field after missing all eight of his attempts in Game 3. HAWKS 116, WIZARDS 98 Paul Millsap scored 29 points, Dennis Schroder had 27, and host Atlanta cut Washington\u2019s lead in their first-round Eastern Conference playoff series to 2-1. Magnus Paajarvi scored at 9 minutes 42 seconds in overtime, giving visiting St. Louis a 4-3 victory over Minnesota in Game 5 of their first-round playoff series and eliminating the Wild, 4-1. The Blues advanced to play the Nashville Predators in the second round. The Minnesota slugger Miguel Sano punched Detroit catcher James McCann in the mask during a bench-clearing episode in the fifth inning of the Tigers\u2019 5-4 victory in Minneapolis. Two innings after Detroit outfielder JaCoby Jones was hit in the face by a pitch thrown by Twins reliever Justin Haley in the third, Tigers starter Matthew Boyd threw behind Sano, who pointed his bat toward Boyd and yelled at him. McCann intervened and appeared to put his mitt in the face of Sano, who reacted immediately with a right hand. Jones was taken to a hospital. Detroit Manager Brad Ausmus said Jones would undergo a C.T. scan. Luis Robles had two saves to earn his fourth shutout, and Alex Muyl scored early to spark the Red Bulls to a 2-0 victory over the Crew in Harrison, N.J., leaving the teams tied atop Major League Soccer\u2019s Eastern Conference standings at 4-3-1. Muyl\u2019s second goal of the season came in the 11th minute when he used his body to knock down a centering pass from Kemar Lawrence and tapped it into the net when Crew goalkeeper Zach Steffen fell. Daniel Royer added a goal on a penalty kick in the 38th minute. CHELSEA ADVANCES TO F.A. CUP FINAL Eden Hazard came off the bench to send Chelsea into the F.A. Cup final with a 4-2 victory over Tottenham in London. Hazard shot the ball through a crowded penalty area into the net in the 75th minute and set up Nemanja Matic\u2019s powerful strike off the inside of the crossbar in the 80th to secure a final against Arsenal or Manchester City, who play Sunday. Kevin Chappell birdied three of his final five holes and moved a step closer to his first PGA Tour victory with a one-under-par 71 at the Texas Open, giving him a one-stroke lead over Branden Grace and John Huh after three rounds in San Antonio. The defending champion Rafael Nadal of Spain beat David Goffin of Belgium, 6-3, 6-1, to move closer to a 10th Monte Carlo Masters title in Monaco. Nadal will meet Albert Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas in an all-Spanish final after Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas defeated Lucas Pouille of France, 6-3, 5-7, 6-1.", "title": "Raptors Rebound Against the Bucks to Even Their Series", "item_type": "Article", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/sports/raptors-rebound-against-the-bucks-to-even-their-series.html"}
