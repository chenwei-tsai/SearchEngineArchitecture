{"text": "Hillary Clinton on Tuesday sharply questioned President Trump\u2019s conduct in office, criticizing his foreign policy pronouncements and penchant for posting on Twitter, and describing herself as \u201cpart of the resistance.\u201d Mrs. Clinton, who has kept a relatively low profile since her defeat in the presidential race, repeatedly characterized Mr. Trump as struggling in the presidency during a public interview with Christiane Amanpour, the CNN correspondent, in Midtown Manhattan. At an event hosted by Women for Women International, an international nonprofit, Mrs. Clinton voiced disbelief at what she cast as the White House\u2019s slapdash approach to issues like health care policy and the North Korean nuclear program. She specifically criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion in a television interview that he would be prepared to meet personally with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, mocking Mr. Trump\u2019s comment as impulsive and na\u00efve. \u201cYou should not offer that in the absence of a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, adding of direct talks: \u201cThey have to be part of a broader strategy, not just thrown up on a tweet some morning: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s get together, see if we can\u2019t get along.\u2019\u201d Throughout her remarks, Mrs. Clinton stressed how thoroughly she had prepared to assume the presidency, strongly implying that Mr. Trump had not matched her preparation. She said Mr. Trump appeared to be struggling to fulfill his campaign promises. \u201cHealth care is complicated, and so is foreign policy and other stuff,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, drawing laughter and applause from a supportive audience. \u201cIf it\u2019s easy, it doesn\u2019t get to the president\u2019s desk.\u201d She also called on the administration not to cut international development initiatives, including aid programs aimed at supporting women.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/us/clinton-trump-interview.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T14:42:32-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T14:42:32-04:00", "abstract": "Hillary Clinton sharply questioned President Trump\u2019s conduct in office, criticizing his foreign policy pronouncements and penchant for posting on Twitter.", "title": "Clinton, Denouncing Trump, Calls Herself \u2018Part of the Resistance\u2019"}
