Justice Steven L. Barrett immediately vacated the verdict, released the defendant, Steven Odiase, and ordered a new trial. Having spent six years in prison maintaining his innocence, Mr. Odiase walked out of the courtroom at the Bronx County Hall of Justice, still in tan prison clothes, and embraced his tearful mother, who rocked him and said, \u201cGod is good! God is good!\u201d \u201cWe are glad he is home,\u201d his sister, Kalimah Odiase, 27, said. \u201cWe have been hurting for a long time.\u201d The Bronx district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, created the Conviction Integrity Unit after taking office in 2016, a sharply different approach than her longtime predecessor, Robert T. Johnson, who insisted he did not need a special office to re-examine convictions. Manhattan and Brooklyn have set up similar offices in recent years. Brooklyn\u2019s office has asked judges to vacate 22 wrongful convictions; Manhattan\u2019s has asked that six verdicts be set aside. Ms. Clark\u2019s unit has reviewed 41 cases and has done 10 in-depth investigations. This was the second time the unit had asked a judge to vacate a guilty verdict in a murder case because of evidence that the defendant had not received a fair trial. The first came last year, when the office asked a judge to set aside a murder conviction against Richard Rosario, who had served 20 years for a 1996 killing, even though a dozen witnesses said he was 1,000 miles away in Florida at the time. Mr. Odiase and his co-defendant, Daikwan Giles, were convicted of murder by a Bronx jury in 2013, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison in the fatal shooting of 15-year-old Juan Jerez at Minerva Place and Creston Avenue on June 12, 2009. Mr. Giles confessed to the murder and was identified by witnesses as being one of two shooters. The main evidence against Mr. Odiase came from a witness who cooperated with prosecutors in return for lighter sentences on other crimes. In July 2015, Mr. Odiase\u2019s lawyers filed a motion asking for a new trial. Prosecutors in the conviction integrity office agreed to re-examine the evidence, and found something odd: A detective\u2019s report turned over to the defense had been redacted to omit key information from a second eyewitness. In the original report, that witness was quoted as saying the second gunman was a tall, bearded man with dark skin. Mr. Odiase is short, has light brown skin and did not have a beard at the time. Yet that information was left out of the report the defense received, prosecutors said on Monday. Ms. Clark said she had not decided whether to retry the case. She commended her assistants for unearthing the exculpatory evidence, which Mr. Odiase\u2019s lawyers had not included in their motion for a new trial. \u201cWe really aren\u2019t looking to uphold the conviction we got,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWe are looking to do justice.\u201d Ms. Clark said her office would also investigate to determine if the prosecutors at the trial had violated ethical rules and should face disciplinary measures. The lead prosecutor at trial, Adam Oustatcher, who retired last year, said in an interview that he remembered handing two versions of the police report over to the defense, one redacted and one complete. The first one was redacted to protect the witness from gang reprisals, but the second was not, he said. Mr. Odiase waved off reporters as he left court and climbed into a friend\u2019s car. He went to his family\u2019s house in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx and took a long shower. Then he burned his prison uniform, one of his lawyers, Pierre Sussman, said.", "abstract": "Steven Odiase had his guilty verdict set aside by a judge because of evidence that he had not received a fair trial.", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/nyregion/steven-odiase-murder-conviction-new-trial.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Guilty Verdict in Murder Case Set Aside at Request of Bronx District Attorney", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T21:03:25-04:00"}
