{"text": "What has become a familiar defense for Mayor Bill de Blasio when he faces ethical questions about his behavior or that of officials in his administration can be boiled down to a simple, grade-school rejoinder: They said I could. Mr. de Blasio said as much in response to inquiries about his fund-raising practices that attracted state and federal scrutiny, about a political nonprofit he created to advocate for his policies, and about the designation of certain outside advisers \u2014 mostly friends and former campaign workers \u2014 as \u201cagents of the city\u201d whose communications he argued should be immune from public disclosure. The mayor offered a version of that defense again on Friday when city investigators disclosed in a report that the correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, had taken his city-issued car beyond the five boroughs on 90 days last year \u2014 mostly on trips to Maine \u2014 and had paid for gas and tolls with city money. Mr. Ponte\u2019s absences coincided with a time of increasing violence at the Rikers Island jail complex and continuing reforms there that he was hired to put in place. \u201cHe was advised; he followed that guidance; that guidance was wrong,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said during a weekly call-in radio appearance with WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer. The mayor said his administration would fix the problem and \u201cmake everyone whole.\u201d Soon after, his first deputy mayor issued a description of \u201cadditional protocols and safeguards\u201d for the use of city vehicles. But Mr. de Blasio\u2019s stance underscored his administration\u2019s tendency to stress the care taken with issues of legality while appearing more casual, and sometimes even dismissive, of ethical questions. For instance, the mayor seemed unconcerned over the roughly $1,800 that Mr. Ponte spent on gas and tolls, often driving to and from his house in Maine, and the time he spent out of state. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge someone if they need down time so long as they get the job done,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, adding of the spending on gas: \u201cI want to remind you that I just released an $84 billion budget, so the fact that there\u2019s a thousand dollars in gas expenses, you know, it\u2019s put in perspective.\u201d But some former city officials and government watchdogs found it hard to comprehend that an official who is in charge of a major department under a federal consent decree and responsible for addressing endemic violence in jails could be unfamiliar with the city\u2019s basic conflict of interest rules. \u201cIt was clear to me we could not use city-owned vehicles at taxpayer expense for vacations or trips out of state,\u201d said Florence Finkle, a former deputy commissioner for integrity and policy at the Correction Department who oversaw internal investigations. \u201cIf an emergency required us to return to Rikers, we had placards we could use with our personal vehicles to gain access to the island.\u201d She cited an episode in which a correction worker lost vacation days for taking a department-issued vehicle to New Jersey. The department only learned of the infraction because an accident occurred, she said, indicating that such activity might be more widespread than is generally known. The Investigation Department\u2019s report said that \u201c21 senior-level employees routinely abused take-home vehicle privileges\u201d and charged gas and tolls for personal trips to city taxpayers. The cases could result in fines from the city\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board. The mayor\u2019s defense of Mr. Ponte led to an unusual back-and-forth between Mr. de Blasio and Mark G. Peters, the investigations commissioner, on Friday. \u201cCommissioner Ponte and others did not receive official \u2018advice\u2019 that they could use their cars for personal trips out of state,\u201d Mr. Peters, who was once the mayor\u2019s campaign treasurer, said in a statement issued in response to the de Blasio administration\u2019s statements to the media. \u201cThere can be no defense of this behavior and City Hall harms government integrity by even trying.\u201d \u201cSnooze,\u201d wrote Eric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, on Twitter. Later, in a telephone interview, Mr. Phillips said Mr. Ponte had not sought \u201cformal written advice\u201d but had consulted with \u201csenior staff\" about \u201cwhat the policy was and whether he was in accordance with it, and they said yes.\u201d Still, the administration\u2019s I-asked-and-they-said-it-was-O.K. defense struck some critics as a weak explanation for what seemed to be an ethical lapse clear enough to anyone ever entrusted with a company car. In most cases, city rules prohibit the use of government vehicles \u201cfor personal activities, except for required rest periods, meals, and brief stops incidental to the conduct of official city business.\u201d Dick Dadey, the executive director of the Citizens Union, a watchdog group, said that Mr. Ponte\u2019s \u201cexplanation rings hollow, and is even more suspect when you look at the administration\u2019s use of lawyers to defend what are questionable practices that may not be illegal but certainly are unethical.\u201d Mr. Dadey said Mr. Ponte \u201cshould be fired, both for being away so much and for the inappropriate use\u201d of the car. Paul J. Massey Jr., the presumed Republican front-runner in this year\u2019s mayoral race, issued a statement calling for Mr. Ponte to be fired, while the president of the correction officers\u2019 union said he should resign. Although they essentially pleaded ignorance, Mr. Ponte and his top aides had every reason to be aware of the rules regarding the use of city-owned vehicles. In a March 2016 case, the Conflicts of Interest Board issued a $1,500 fine to Gregory Kuczinski, an assistant commissioner for investigations in the Correction Department, after he had a correction officer drive him, his wife and his children to the airport for a family vacation. Mr. Kuczinski, who was promoted by Mr. Ponte shortly after the fine, was also reprimanded on Friday for using his city-owned car for personal trips to airports and on a golf outing.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-joseph-ponte-jails-rikers.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T20:38:14-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T20:38:14-04:00", "abstract": "The mayor offered a familiar defense for Joseph Ponte\u2019s use of a city-owned vehicle to travel beyond the five boroughs on 90 days last year: He was told it was O.K.", "title": "De Blasio Blames Jails Chief\u2019s Getaways on Bad Advice"}
