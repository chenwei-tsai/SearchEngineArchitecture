But \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2\u201d is hardly the first Broadway show to check in with beloved characters.", "text": "Henrik Ibsen\u2019s Nora walks back through the door she famously slammed all those years ago, and we have so many questions. Where has she been, and what has she been up to? She\u2019s looking rather well, actually, decked out in expensive clothes. But how did she get the money? And for goodness\u2019 sake, why has she returned? Picking up long after the ending of Ibsen\u2019s \u201cA Doll\u2019s House,\u201d Lucas Hnath\u2019s new Broadway play, \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2\u201d \u2014 starring Laurie Metcalf as Nora, and Chris Cooper as Torvald, the husband she left behind \u2014 fills in those blanks and more. Directed by Sam Gold, and opening on April 27 at the John Golden Theater, it joins a tradition of plays and musicals that seek to reunite audiences with familiar characters inside a fresh story. Classics have often inspired sequels. \u201cThe Taming of the Shrew\u201d even got one when it was new: \u201cThe Woman\u2019s Prize, or the Tamer Tamed,\u201d by a Shakespearean contemporary, John Fletcher. Brian Friel riffed on Chekhov\u2019s \u201cUncle Vanya\u201d and \u201cThree Sisters\u201d in \u201cAfterplay,\u201d and Jeff Whitty imagined a post-gunshot future for another Ibsen heroine in \u201cThe Further Adventures of Hedda Gabler.\u201d The hottest ticket in London right now, the Broadway-bound \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d is a next-chapter kind of play, too \u2014 though it builds on J. K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter books and films, not a previous theater piece. But any stage sequel is a delicate operation, especially if the original work set the bar high. Here are some of the more notable (if not always successful) attempts. The musical \u201cOf Thee I Sing\u201d was brilliantly in tune with what made American audiences laugh during the Great Depression: stinging political satire, and lots of it. With music by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin and a book by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind, it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 and ran on Broadway for more than a year. The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson called it \u201cthe musical hit of the season.\u201d But when the same team delivered a sequel, \u201cLet \u2019Em Eat Cake\u201d (1933), Atkinson detected \u201ca rasp in the humor,\u201d a lesser quality to the music, and a bitterness and cruelty that kept the show from being fun. It ran just 90 performances \u2014 not terrible, but hardly a smash. The early 1980s proved a grim patch for Broadway sequels. Not even the great Chita Rivera, in a starring role, could save Michael Stewart, Charles Strouse and Lee Adams\u2019s \u201cBring Back Birdie\u201d (1981), the follow-up to their hit musical \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d (1960). Described as \u201cdepressing\u201d by the Times critic Frank Rich, it lasted just four performances. That\u2019s one fewer than \u201cA Doll\u2019s Life\u201d (1982), Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Larry Grossman\u2019s musical sequel to \u201cA Doll\u2019s House,\u201d directed by Harold Prince. Mr. Rich called it a \u201cperplexing curiosity\u201d that \u201cunintentionally parodies or trivializes feminism \u2014 and misreads Ibsen\u2019s play.\u201d Then there was \u201cMonday After the Miracle\u201d (1982), which continued the story of \u201cThe Miracle Worker\u201d (1959). The playwright William Gibson and the director Arthur Penn had a vibrant young movie star, Karen Allen, to play Helen Keller, but also a script that meant to be more powerful than it was. The show fizzled, closing after seven performances. You can trace Matthew Broderick\u2019s early career partly through Neil Simon comedies: first, \u201cBrighton Beach Memoirs\u201d (1983), Mr. Broderick\u2019s Broadway debut, then that play\u2019s first sequel, \u201cBiloxi Blues\u201d (1985). In both, he played the aspiring writer Eugene Jerome, a character Jonathan Silverman took over for \u201cBroadway Bound\u201d (1986), the last work in this autobiographical trilogy. (Mr. Broderick played the role in the film \u201cBiloxi Blues,\u201d Mr. Silverman in the film \u201cBrighton Beach Memoirs.\u201d) Following Eugene from his teenage years in Depression-era Brooklyn through his Army training in World War II and back home again, all three plays were hits; from 1983 to 1988, Eugene Jerome was almost always somewhere on Broadway. An attempted revival in 2009 didn\u2019t quite come off, though; \u201cBrighton Beach Memoirs,\u201d meant to run in repertory with \u201cBroadway Bound,\u201d played nine performances before closing, and \u201cBroadway Bound\u201d never opened. William Finn\u2019s one-act musical \u201cFalsettoland\u201d (1990) hardly seems like a sequel anymore, but that\u2019s how it was first produced. Only later was it joined with its predecessor, \u201cMarch of the Falsettos\u201d (1981) \u2014 itself a sequel to Mr. Finn\u2019s \u201cIn Trousers\u201d (1978). The result was the two-act \u201cFalsettos\u201d (1992), with a book that was written with the show\u2019s director, James Lapine. A wrenching portrait of a New York family on the eve of, and then in the midst of, the AIDS crisis, \u201cFalsettos\u201d returned to Broadway in a lauded revival last fall. The Times critic Walter Kerr described \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\u201d (1978) as a \u201crather simple-minded\u201d musical comedy, but it ran on Broadway for more than 1,500 performances, anyway, from the Carter years right into the Reagan administration. \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public\u201d (1994), a spinoff set in Las Vegas and festooned with sparkling costumes by Bob Mackie, had worse luck: A mere 16 shows, and it was done. Why haunt the sewers of Paris when you could frolic on a Brooklyn boardwalk? \u201cLove Never Dies\u201d (2010), Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s sequel to \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d \u2014 which has logged more than 12,000 performances and cultivated an unusually devoted following since opening on Broadway in 1988 \u2014 is set a decade later, in 1907, with its masked man relocated to Coney Island, and its soprano, Christine, to Manhattan. The show met with greater success in a revamped version in Australia in 2011 than it did the year before in the West End of London, where it acquired the unfortunate nickname \u201cPaint Never Dries.\u201d  Never say die, though: This fall, the show finally embarks on a United States tour.", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00"}
