{"text": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Even by the nontraditional standards of a neophyte politician \u2014 a billionaire often compared to the one now occupying the White House \u2014 it was a surprise. Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, strode into the Capitol rotunda here, denounced a series of budget cuts approved by Republican lawmakers and lifted the lid off a silver platter to reveal an aromatic pile of fresh bull manure atop a copy of the spending plan. \u201cWe need to be able to not strangle our state into just oblivion,\u201d Mr. Justice said in a booming voice before affixing his veto to an unsullied copy of the budget proposal, which he described as \u201cnothing more than a bunch of political bull you-know-what.\u201d The episode, in mid-April, was probably not what West Virginians were expecting from their new governor \u2014 and not just because of the dung. Mr. Justice, a businessman who owns mining and other companies, cannonballed into the state\u2019s collapsing Democratic Party, winning the governorship in November with vague promises to prop up the coal industry and turn the struggling state around, and a tendency to mention his friend Donald J. Trump. Since taking office, however, Mr. Justice has operated from his own political playbook. He has paired his coal-country credentials with an effort to raise some taxes and other revenue to avoid painful cuts, moves that have surprised members of both parties. As Democrats around the country agonize over their path forward in ever-redder states like this one, Mr. Justice is facing off with Republicans while keeping distance between himself and his party\u2019s tarnished national brand. \u201cHis style may be different,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a former governor who faces an uphill re-election battle next year. But different is crucial for Democrats in states that are moving to the right as quickly as this one. \u201cYou better tell your story\u201d before someone else does, Mr. Manchin said. Mr. Justice, 66, put it this way at his State of the State address in February: \u201cYou elected me as your governor, a person that had never been a politician, in the wake of me running as a Democrat, at a time when Donald Trump won our state by 17,000 million percent.\u201d (Mr. Trump actually claimed 67.9 percent of the vote.) And then, saying that West Virginia was \u201cdying 50th\u201d and in the middle of an \u201c18-karat dog\u2019s mess,\u201d Mr. Justice did something unexpected for a man who seemed so similar to Mr. Trump and who had campaigned on not raising taxes: He proposed $450 million in new revenue, mostly through increases in sales and business taxes. \u201cHe did an absolute U-turn,\u201d said Mitch Carmichael, the Republican president of the State Senate, adding: \u201cI think he\u2019s more Republican in his philosophies. Where he has gotten away from that a little bit is his tax-and-spend policies.\u201d Mr. Justice followed the address in February with a \u201cSave Our State\u201d tour geared toward promoting his budget proposal and a separate infrastructure plan that he said would create 48,000 jobs. The state will need more than coal, he says, to get back on its feet. He has criticized Republican proposals to cut spending on health care and higher education and brought mayonnaise sandwiches to the Capitol to illustrate what he said the Republicans were offering. He has called some lawmakers \u201cknuckleheads\u201d and, at one point, compared himself to a grizzly bear and Ryan Ferns, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, to a poodle, prompting Republicans to say Mr. Justice is embarrassing the state. \u201cI think the Legislature thought they could control him, but they can\u2019t,\u201d said Terri Ball, 58, a Democrat who said she had voted for Mr. Justice and Mr. Trump. Ms. Ball was buying vinyl wall coating last month in Madison, where campaign signs showing Mr. Justice in a coal miner\u2019s helmet still hung near the center of town. But when lawmakers return this week for a planned special session, Mr. Justice is expected to push for a compromise that will generate less revenue and eventually lower the income tax, though it is not clear whether it will make it through the State House of Delegates. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to protect education, trying to protect health care, but at the same time, largely anti-environment, and you\u2019re doing tax cuts, changes,\u201d said Simon F. Haeder, an assistant professor of political science at West Virginia University. \u201cHe\u2019s in a tough spot. It\u2019s a shifting state; he\u2019s an unusual Democrat.\u201d Mr. Justice\u2019s supporters say that in a state with a history of conservative Democrats, that is precisely his strength. \u201cDemocrats in West Virginia need to create their own identity, much like what Jim Justice is doing,\u201d said Josh Sword, the president of the state\u2019s A.F.L.-C.I.O. More than six and a half feet tall with a lumbering physical presence, Mr. Justice is worth $1.6 billion, according to Forbes. He owns more than 100 companies in multiple states, including farms, metallurgical coal mines and the Greenbrier, a resort hotel in the Allegheny Mountains. He is also a high school basketball coach. In 2015, a month before Mr. Trump descended a Trump Tower escalator and vowed to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d Mr. Justice held a rally at a civic center down the street from the Greenbrier and announced that he was running for governor with the intention of raising up his much-maligned state. \u201cWhy not West Virginia?\u201d he cheered. The governor\u2019s race certainly seemed to be the Republicans\u2019 to lose. West Virginians, alienated by Democratic orthodoxy on climate change, energy and social issues, blamed President Barack Obama for the coal industry\u2019s struggles. Democrats had already lost control of the State Legislature and most of the delegation to Washington, with all three of the House seats and one of the two Senate seats in Republican hands. \u201cI would say the Democratic Party in West Virginia is in disarray,\u201d said Stephen Skinner, a former member of the State House of Delegates who lost a race for State Senate in the fall. \u201cJustice has appeared, at this moment in time, to jump into the kind of vacuum.\u201d Mr. Justice, who has expressed doubts about human-driven climate change and kept his distance from Hillary Clinton, was not anybody\u2019s idea of a party savior. His opponents pointed out that he had only recently joined the party. \u201cI\u2019ve been both\u201d Republican and Democrat, Mr. Justice said in an interview, \u201cbut I just feel like that today the common, everyday guy is really hurting, and he needs a voice.\u201d He declined to release his tax returns, as did his opponent, and his businesses have faced claims of unpaid obligations and safety fines, which NPR tallied at more than $15 million. (In a statement, his son, Jay Justice, said the companies had reduced their outstanding obligations, but he did not provide details.) But he was a wealthy political outsider whose status as a mining executive insulated him against most of the Republican rhetoric about the Democrats\u2019 so-called war on coal, and he beat his Republican opponent, Bill Cole \u2014 the Senate president at the time \u2014 by 7 points. And then, Mr. Justice said, he got into office and realized how bad things were. \u201cThe state of the being for West Virginia today is far, far more dire than I would\u2019ve ever dreamt that it could be,\u201d Mr. Justice said in an interview last month, adding: \u201cYou\u2019ve got hopelessness. And you\u2019ve got a drug epidemic. And you\u2019ve got a $500 million hole in the bucket. What are you gonna do?\u201d Mr. Justice had few kind words for national Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to where we legislate, in a lot of ways, for the exception, and the masses felt left out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have Democratic leaders that can articulate \u2014 and I\u2019m not tooting my horn \u2014 but can\u2019t articulate and be down to where everybody gets it and everything \u2014 that\u2019s one thing I can really do.\u201d And he continued to praise Mr. Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re good friends,\u201d Mr. Justice said, \u201cand I think he\u2019s battling the battle and doing all that he can do, or he\u2019s trying as hard as he can try.\u201d Even if they view Mr. Justice, with his unorthodox style and personal wealth, as an outlier, some in the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing feel a measure of relief at the turn of events in Charleston. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what it means to be a Democrat at this time,\u201d said Micah Weglinski, 38, of Morgantown, who organized a town-hall-style meeting this year as part of a swell of activism in the eastern part of the state. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the best thing that we could hope for.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/jim-justice-west-virginia-governor.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T05:00:20-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T05:00:20-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Justice, a billionaire businessman who counts President Trump as a friend, is facing off with Republicans while keeping his party\u2019s tarnished national brand at a distance.", "title": "West Virginia\u2019s Governor, an \u2018Unusual Democrat,\u2019 Fights a G.O.P.
