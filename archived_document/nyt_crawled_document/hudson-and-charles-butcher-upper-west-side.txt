{"text": "Hudson & Charles, the West Village butcher, has opened a branch on the Upper West Side. It specializes in grass-finished beef, lamb and pork, and offers more esoteric choices like boned oxtail meat, petite tender and flatiron steaks, ready-to-roast marrow bones and guanciale. Free-range chickens are available, and rabbits will be on hand soon. The store carries duck fat, house-made sausages, p\u00e2t\u00e9s and stocks made from duck, lamb, chicken and beef. Kevin Haverty, who owns the store with J. Fox, said they opened this shop because they had many customers from the neighborhood, and wanted more space: Hudson & Charles, 555 Amsterdam Avenue (87th Street), 212-799-1269, hudsonandcharles.com.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/dining/hudson-and-charles-butcher-upper-west-side.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Food", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T14:15:46-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T14:15:46-04:00", "abstract": "Hudson & Charles now has a larger outpost with more esoteric cuts on the Upper West Side.", "title": "Downtown Butcher Shop Opens a Branch Uptown"}
