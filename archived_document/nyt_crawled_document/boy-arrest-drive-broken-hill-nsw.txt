Well, just try to compete with this: Police officers near the Australian mining town of Broken Hill stopped a sport utility vehicle Saturday that was being driven by a 12-year-old boy who had been on the road in the middle of nowhere, driving alone, for 800 miles. And he was only a third of the way to his chosen destination on the other side of this vast country. Let\u2019s step back for a minute and consider the scale of this endeavor. The police said the boy, who has not been identified, took the family car and started driving on Friday from his home in Kendall, a small town about 220 miles northeast of Sydney. The distance between there and Perth, on the far western end of the country, is around 4,300 kilometers, or 2,700 miles. How far is that? It\u2019s similar to the drive from New York to Los Angeles, which is a little more than 2,800 miles, or from Ottawa to Edmonton. A quick reminder: The boy is 12. And while it\u2019s common for young people in Australia and all over the world to drive tractors or other vehicles at young ages, this boy managed to drive on major roads for an entire day without being found out or being harmed. The police said he was stopped at 11 a.m. Saturday, which means he spent a night alone on the road. So how far did he really go? The distance traveled doesn\u2019t look like much on a map, particularly given Australia\u2019s size, but the 800 miles that he drove \u2014 again, alone, as a 12-year-old \u2014 is about the equivalent of making the long and annoying drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles, back and forth, with a few dozen more miles thrown in for rest stops and food. Or, for our non-American readers, it\u2019s like driving from Paris to Prague, deciding that\u2019s not far enough, then deciding to head for Vienna. Road trips in Australia are a little different than road trips in many other places. The police said the boy had clear and specific plans, but to complete his intended journey, he would have had to drive through the Nullarbor Plain, a flat, desolate, hot and largely empty stretch in the south that is about four times the size of Belgium. Those who have made the drive warn people to pack extra gasoline and car parts \u2014 in addition to ample food and water \u2014 because gas stations are so far apart from each other. The tourism board advises that people take six days just to get across the Nullarbor. Driving at night is not advised because of the risk of hitting stray emus, kangaroos, wombats or camels. Yes, camels: About 100,000 wild ones are there, the descendants of animals imported to help build inland railroads. Online, just a mere mention of the drive across Australia often elicits references to something even more frightening: \u201cWolf Creek,\u201d a well-known Australian horror film about murders in the outback. It should be noted that the boy is safe. He was released into the care of his parents on Sunday, and the police said they hoped to speak with the boy and his parents on Monday. An investigation into the incident is continuing, and the police have not said much beyond that. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unusual,\u201d a spokeswoman for the police said in an interview Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that occurs every day.\u201d Online, Australians reacted with awe and inquiries. Several people seemed impressed that the boy managed to avoid getting a speeding ticket and that he would even take on such an expedition. Others raised a series of questions, some of which various reporters are also sharing, including: \u2022 How did he pay for gas? \u2022 Who taught him how to drive? \u2022 What compels a 12-year-old to do something that drastic? \u2022 Did his parents report him missing, and if so, when? \u2022 What kind of punishment does the boy face from the police or his parents? \u2022 Is anything deeper or darker going on with this story that we\u2019re unaware of?
