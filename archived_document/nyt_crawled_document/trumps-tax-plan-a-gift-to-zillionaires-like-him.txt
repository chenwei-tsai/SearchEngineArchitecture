Why, you announce a tax cut! And in your self-absorbed way, you announce a tax cut that will hugely benefit yourself. Imagine those millions saved! You feel better already! I\u2019m deeply skeptical that President Trump will manage to get a tax reform package passed into law, and that\u2019s just as well. Trump\u2019s new tax \u201cplan\u201d (more like an extremely vague plan for a plan) is an irresponsible, shameless, budget-busting gift to zillionaires like himself. This isn\u2019t about \u201cjobs,\u201d as the White House claims. If it were, it might cut employment taxes, which genuinely do discourage hiring. Rather, it\u2019s about huge payouts to the wealthiest Americans \u2014 and deficits be damned! If Republicans embrace this \u201cplan\u201d after all their hand-wringing about deficits and debt, we should build a Grand Monument to Hypocrisy in their honor. Trump\u2019s tax \u201cplan\u201d is a betrayal of his voters. He talks of helping ordinary Americans even as he enriches tycoons like himself. For example, it\u2019s great that the tax plan promises help with child care costs, a huge burden for low-income families, especially single moms. But Trump doesn\u2019t explain what form his help will take. Maybe he will eventually provide details, but in his campaign tax plan (which over all seems similar to the latest), fewer than 10 percent of low-income households with children would get anything at all, according to a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in February. It added that under the campaign plan, families earning between $10,000 and $30,000 a year would receive an average child care benefit of just $10. In fairness, Trump\u2019s proposal does include some sensible elements. Raising the standard deduction is smart and would simplify everything, reducing cheating and the need for record-keeping because millions of filers would no longer itemize deductions. But the heart of Trump\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d is to lower taxes for corporations and the affluent. It would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, without which Trump would have paid less than 4 percent in taxes for 2005; with it, he paid 25 percent. Conservatives emphasize that the official top corporate tax rate in the U.S. is too high, and they have a point. The top rate for American corporations \u2014 almost 39 percent, including a 35 percent federal rate and a bit more for the average state rate \u2014 is among the highest in the world, according to the Tax Foundation. Yet that\u2019s deeply misleading, because most companies don\u2019t pay that rate. The Government Accountability Office found that two-thirds of active corporations paid no federal tax. Even large, profitable corporations paid an average federal rate of only 14 percent \u2014 and Boeing, Verizon, General Electric and Priceline paid no federal income tax over a five-year period, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. There\u2019ve been many studies showing that the U.S. effective marginal rate for corporations is in the same ballpark as in other industrialized countries (some say it\u2019s a bit lower, others a bit higher). So, sure, let\u2019s lower the official corporate tax rate while reducing loopholes, but don\u2019t pretend this will create a ton of new jobs. What would make a big difference, at least for some wealthy people, is another bit of chicanery in the proposal: Trump apparently would allow some business owners to dodge personal income tax by paying at the much lower corporate rate. In other words, tycoons would try to structure their incomes to pay not at a 39.6 percent top personal rate but at a 15 percent corporate rate. This isn\u2019t tax policy; it\u2019s a heist. Then there\u2019s the elimination of the estate tax. The White House talks solemnly about protecting family farms and other businesses, but give us a break! The estate tax now affects only couples worth more than $11 million. About one-fifth of 1 percent of Americans are affected \u2014 but the estate tax does limit the rise of inequality and assures a hint of fairness, since much of the wealth in rich estates has never been taxed at all. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Trump\u2019s tax \u201cplan\u201d would be paid for partly \u201cwith growth\u201d \u2014 which means that he has no idea how to pay for it. The Tax Policy Center examined Trump\u2019s campaign tax plan and found it would cause the federal debt to rise by at least $7 trillion in the first decade, and more than $20 trillion by 2036 \u2014 slowing growth, not raising it. To put the latter number in perspective, that\u2019s additional borrowing of about $160,000 per American household. Effectively, we\u2019d borrow from China or other countries to finance huge tax breaks for Trump and his minions.
