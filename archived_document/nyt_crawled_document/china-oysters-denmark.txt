{"text": "BEIJING \u2014 Is an alien mollusk species choking your shoreline? Don\u2019t despair. China\u2019s ravenous, inventive internet users have an answer to unwelcome shellfish. They\u2019re ready to devour them. The Danish Embassy in Beijing has been absorbing that lesson since it shared a report online this week about a plague of Pacific oysters, a stubborn, gray intruder that has spread explosively along parts of the Scandinavian coast. \u201cFresh oysters are cramming the shore, but Danes aren\u2019t the least bit happy,\u201d the embassy explained on Monday in a message on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media service like Twitter. \u201cVisit the Danish coast to eat fresh oysters, is it a date?\u201d it added, tongue in cheek. The reaction was more than the embassy anticipated. By Friday the message had attracted around 15,000 quips and comments, and the Pacific oyster invasion was reported by many Chinese newspapers and news websites. \u201cWe expected a much more mild reaction,\u201d the public diplomacy and media section of the Danish Embassy said in emailed answers to questions. Instead, it said, the embassy\u2019s online accounts were \u201cwere flooded by recipes from Chinese netizens.\u201d Most of the advice offered by commenters boiled down to a simple solution: Send armies of Chinese tourists to scarf down the oysters. But that advice often came with a witty twist. \u201cFree up visas and introduce oyster-eater visas, 10 years unlimited re-entry,\u201d said one of the initial suggestions. \u201cI\u2019d bet that these oysters would be exterminated in about five years.\u201d \u201cI solemnly swear to join the Danish Oyster-Resistance Volunteer Army,\u201d said another. \u201cI will dedicate my tongue and taste buds to Sino-Danish friendship until these oyster invaders are vanquished.\u201d Whoever runs the Danish Embassy\u2019s Weibo account took the suggestions in good stride. Denmark could also export the oysters to China, the account said. \u201cThank you to the righteous advance team of oyster eaters,\u201d it said in another message. \u201cThe beaches of Denmark await you.\u201d The invasion of the Pacific oysters is an environmental threat in Scandinavia, where they have spread out from oyster farms, overwhelming mussels and native shellfish and smothering shores. By the end of the week, some of the hubbub in China about the Danish oysters had also turned serious. News reports said that China cultivated 80 percent of the world\u2019s farmed oysters, most of them the pesky Pacific oyster, so Denmark\u2019s would not be necessary. Other reports pointed out that the eat-them-to-extinction idea had been proposed before. But the Danish Embassy said that it had received some sincere proposals from Chinese companies to import the oysters. It also offered some advice for visitors inspired by the oyster frenzy. \u201cDue to the clean water environment in Denmark, most of the oysters there are therefore safe to eat, but we would suggest consulting locals before guzzling them,\u201d the public diplomacy and media section said by email. \u201cFor us, they are appetizing simply with some lemon and white wine, but for many Chinese, they would not want to eat the oysters without grilling them with mashed garlic and chili sauce.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/world/asia/china-oysters-denmark.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T07:40:53-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T07:40:53-04:00", "abstract": "When the Danish Embassy in Beijing posted online about an invasive species clogging the shores back home, it drew a more enthusiastic response than it bargained for.", "title": "Chinese Offer to Eat Denmark\u2019s Oyster Problem to Extinction"}
