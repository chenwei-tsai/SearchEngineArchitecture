{"text": "Baseball managers hate to mess with success, and so far this season, the Yankees have had plenty of it. Entering Friday, they had the second-best record in the American League despite having lost their starting shortstop and catcher to injuries. Still, as soon as Didi Gregorius, the shortstop, was ready to return, Manager Joe Girardi did not hesitate to insert him into the starting lineup \u2014 for the opening of an important series against the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night at Yankee Stadium, even though that meant benching Ronald Torreyes, who has been a more than capable replacement. Girardi said he was not worried that the lineup change might alter his club\u2019s momentum. \u201cI\u2019ve looked forward to the day that Didi was to come back,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t forgotten the year that Didi had last year, and I think it\u2019s good to have him back.\u201d Gregorius \u2014 who missed the first 19 games of the season with a right shoulder strain sustained while he played for the Netherlands in the World Baseball Classic \u2014 hit a surprising 20 home runs in 2016, the third on the team. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be back with all these guys,\u201d said Gregorius, who played five rehabilitation games for Class A Tampa, batting .444. \u201cIt\u2019s something awesome. It\u2019s not really like opening day, but it\u2019s my first game, and I want to get off to a good start.\u201d Girardi put Gregorius at shortstop and sixth in the batting order against the Orioles right-hander Kevin Gausman on Friday, the opening of a six-game homestand. In just the first two innings, Gregorius made a diving stop at shortstop and hit a double in his first at-bat. In Gregorius\u2019s absence, Torreyes, 23, hit .308 with a home run and 13 runs batted in, and he played nearly flawless defense at shortstop and third base. He had two hits in Thursday\u2019s 3-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. \u201cTorreyes now will become what he\u2019s designed to be,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cHe\u2019ll play everywhere I tell him: second, short, left, third, right. I\u2019m just going to move him around and make sure these guys stay strong and fresh.\u201d A triple by Torreyes against the Orioles in Baltimore on April 9 drove in two runs to ignite a come-from-behind victory after the Yankees had started the season with a 1-4 record. They went 12-3 starting with that game, including eight wins in nine games on their last homestand, and before Friday\u2019s game sat in second place in the A.L. East, a game behind Baltimore. \u201cYou look at the job that Ronald Torreyes did \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t be here in this spot if he hadn\u2019t done what he\u2019s done to this point,\u201d Girardi said. But with the return of Gregorius, the Yankees moved a step closer to fielding the team they had at the close of spring training. Catcher Gary Sanchez, on the disabled list since April 8 with a biceps strain, is scheduled to begin a rehabilitation assignment with Class AAA Scranton on Tuesday. \u201cI was a little bit shocked the way we started, going 1-4,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cThen we came home and had a great homestand. And now with Didi back, it\u2019s like we\u2019re getting our team whole again. Hopefully, things won\u2019t be changing a whole lot.\u201d Gregorius said he had watched the Yankees thriving during his time on the disabled list and was not surprised by how well the team had played despite the injuries. \u201cThese guys are good,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody saw what the team did last year in the second half, so we try to keep the same momentum going.\u201d \u201cNow that I\u2019m here,\u201d Gregorius added, \u201cI got to keep the pace up with them and start my season off on a good note.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/baseball/new-york-yankees-baltimore-orioles-didi-gregorius.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T20:43:12-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T20:43:12-04:00", "abstract": "Gregorius missed the first 19 games of the season.
