{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cIn Coulter\u2019s Free Speech Battle, the Right\u2019s Latest Rallying Cry\u201d (front page, April 27): Ann Coulter\u2019s decision to cancel a speech at Berkeley because of the possibility of violent protest will no doubt be cast as another violation of \u201cfree speech.\u201d Alas, the idea of free speech has progressively been expanded way beyond its original meaning. Free speech is meant to prevent censorship, to allow people to express any ideas in public, however unpopular or unsettling. It does not imply that these ideas must be expressed anywhere, anytime, under any conditions. The New York Times, for example, is under no obligation to publish an outrageous and offensive letter in the name of \u201cfree speech.\u201d Ann Coulter has had ample opportunity to express her opinions in public. It would be perverse to portray her as a victim of censorship simply because she cannot express her ideas on the Berkeley campus. ROBERT LAUNAY, EVANSTON, ILL.
