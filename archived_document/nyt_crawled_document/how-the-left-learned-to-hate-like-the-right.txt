{"text": "MARIETTA, GA. \u2014 Shortly before President Trump\u2019s swearing-in, I spoke to Steve Cohen, a liberal congressman from Tennessee, about his decision to skip the ceremony. Mr. Cohen said his horror of Mr. Trump almost made him understand how Tea Partyers might have felt under President Barack Obama. \u201cI want my country back!\u201d he said, echoing the right\u2019s rallying cry. One hundred days into his administration, President Trump has few legislative achievements to his name. But he has forced liberals to experience the near-apocalyptic revulsion that conservatives have often felt toward Democratic presidents. In doing so, he has unwittingly created a new movement in American politics, as Democrats channel the sort of all-encompassing outrage that has long fueled grass-roots conservatism. For decades, Democrats have envied the Republicans\u2019 passionate, locally attuned base. It turns out that what Democrats were missing was a sense of existential emergency. Mr. Trump has provided it. Objectively, there\u2019s no comparison between the conservative demonization of Mr. Obama and the progressive case against Mr. Trump. People on the right saw Mr. Obama as a Kenyan-born secret Muslim with a hidden agenda to hobble American power and a health care reform plan to establish \u201cdeath panels.\u201d None of that is true. People on the left believe that Mr. Trump has incited hatred against minorities, and boasted about grabbing women by their genitals. Democrats think that the president and his family are blatantly profiting off the presidency and that he welcomed the help of a hostile foreign power during the election. All this is grounded in fact. Facts aside, there is an emotional symmetry between the conservative reaction to past Democratic presidents and the liberal response to Mr. Trump. Suddenly, left-of-center people get what it\u2019s like to have a president who is the living negation of all they value, a president who makes them ashamed before their children and terrified for their future. Now they\u2019ve learned what it\u2019s like to worry that malevolent foreign conspirators are manipulating American affairs. And these feelings, it turns out, are an extremely powerful goad to political action. I saw this recently in Georgia\u2019s Sixth District, a conservative area that had sent to Congress first Newt Gingrich and then Tom Price, now Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of health and human services. I was there to report on the special congressional election to fill Mr. Price\u2019s seat. Ahead of the April 18 open primary, a Democrat, Jon Ossoff, was showing unexpected strength. In the event, he only narrowly failed to win the district outright, and goes forward to a June runoff against the leading Republican vote-getter. Lots of outsiders were paying attention to the race; Mr. Ossoff raised a staggering $8 million for what was widely seen as a referendum on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. On the ground, though, the people powering the campaign were locals, many of them previously apolitical suburban women shocked into action by the presidential election. In November\u2019s aftermath, Amy Nosek, a 42-year-old stay-at-home mother of two living in an affluent Atlanta suburb, sank into depression, though she\u2019d never been depressed before. \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to go pick up my kids from the school bus because I didn\u2019t want to talk to the other parents, or see anybody,\u201d she told me. As an antidote, she and a friend founded a local chapter of Indivisible, the network of anti-Trump groups that sprang up after the election. Soon, they were consumed by political organizing. \u201cWe\u2019re working all the time,\u201d Ms. Nosek said. \u201cSometimes, I fall asleep on the couch at 9 or 10 p.m., and then I wake up at 2 and I\u2019m working until 4.\u201d Like her, most of the activists I met were new to electoral politics. Some had not even known what district they lived in or who their local representatives were. Now, thanks to Mr. Trump, they were obsessed. I was struck by how their stories echoed tales of conservative political awakening. Until the rise of Mr. Trump, wave after wave of right-wing Republican activism was driven by comfortable but morally scandalized suburbanites, particularly suburban women. Shaken by what they saw as liberal attacks on beloved institutions \u2014 family, church, law enforcement, private property \u2014 they organized politically, and found meaning and community in it. This phenomenon long predates the Tea Party movement that so galvanized Republican voters for the 2010 midterm elections. In her 2001 study, \u201cSuburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right,\u201d Lisa McGirr described how Orange County, Calif., became ground zero for militant conservatism in the early 1960s: \u201cAt living room bridge clubs, at backyard barbecues, and at kitchen coffee klatches, the middle-class men and women of Orange County \u2018awakened\u2019 to what they perceived as the threats of communism and liberalism.\u201d Campaigning to save the nuclear family from the depredations of the Equal Rights Amendment, Phyllis Schlafly induced housewives to become local activists. \u201cThese were local women whom most politicians feared to alienate,\u201d wrote Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s biographer, Donald Critchlow, \u201cbecause these women talked politics, volunteered in political campaigns and wore political buttons when they came to meetings.\u201d Democrats have their passionate local leaders, but they\u2019ve lacked a Schlafly-style nationwide network of kitchen-table activists. And outside big cities, the party has allowed its local infrastructure to whither. Mr. Trump is changing all that. For many Democrats, his election was a traumatic event that demands a response, lest their country become unrecognizable. Democratic women, especially, find it intolerable and degrading to call Mr. Trump their president. \u201cThe story we hear again and again and again is that it\u2019s moms and other women who came together after the election and said, \u2018This is totally unacceptable,\u2019 \u201d said Ezra Levin, one of Indivisible\u2019s founders. Alan Abramowitz, a professor at Emory University who studies political polarization, said of Democratic antipathy to Mr. Trump, \u201cIf anything, I think it\u2019s gotten stronger since he became president because the stuff he\u2019s been doing has just exacerbated those negative feelings.\u201d There are dangers for Democrats in this absolute loathing. Hatred obliterates nuance and fosters conspiracy theories, a particular temptation when the country is sorting through real evidence of the Trump campaign\u2019s worrisome foreign entanglements. It\u2019s probably not good for America that every election \u2014 even an off-year special election in placid suburban Georgia \u2014 feels like a struggle over the future of civilization. Yet, as the right has repeatedly shown over the past 50 years, disgust is politically potent. Nothing, Professor Abramowitz said, works as well as what political scientists call \u201cnegative affect\u201d \u2014 intense dislike \u2014 for \u201cgetting people energized and mobilized.\u201d So far, the lesson of this presidency is that when it comes to building political power, love does not, in fact, trump hate.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/opinion/sunday/how-the-left-learned-to-hate-like-the-right.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T14:30:20-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-04-29T14:30:20-04:00", "abstract": "Liberals are discovering what conservatives have known for years: Negative energy is a powerful force.", "title": "How the Left Learned to Hate Like the Right"}
