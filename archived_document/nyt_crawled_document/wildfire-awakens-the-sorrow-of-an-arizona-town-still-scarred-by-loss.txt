Those were familiar words. On June 28, 2013, a bolt of lightning sparked a cluster of parched brush on Yarnell Hill. Two days later, 19 firefighters were killed and half of Yarnell was destroyed by flames. It was the deadliest day in American firefighting since the Sept. 11 attacks. For those who lived or worked in Yarnell then, there was life as it was before the deadly fire and there is life after it, forever transformed. As this week\u2019s fire roared to life, growing tenfold in two hours, it awoke painful memories. Flames fed on the bone-dry vegetation on the east side of town, opposite the side that burned in 2013. Sheriff\u2019s deputies knocked on the doors of homes that stood in the fire\u2019s path, urging residents to leave. This time, they did. Fuel breaks carved in the vegetation after the 2013 fire stopped this week\u2019s fire from reaching the town. Only a handful of structures had been lost by Friday. In 2013, 127 homes burned. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned our lesson in the hardest possible way,\u201d Chief Palm said. From a home in town, an emergency shelter in nearby Prescott and at the incident command post in Peeples Valley, Yarnell\u2019s neighbor to the north, Chief Palm and four others talked about what they learned from the two fires they experienced \u2014 and what they would rather forget. Chuck Tidey, 69, president of the Yarnell-Peeples Valley Chamber of Commerce After the smoke cleared and the devastation of the 2013 fire came into full focus, Mr. Tidey helped pull together a group of volunteers to rebuild homes and soothe broken hearts in Yarnell. He was attending one of the group\u2019s regular Wednesday meetings when somebody called to tell about the follow-up fire. \u201cI was, like, a fire? We\u2019re still recovering from a fire,\u201d Mr. Tidey said. \u201cI\u2019m not really worried about now. I\u2019m worried about a week or two from now. We kind of suck it up and go on. But it\u2019s when the time passes and people start thinking about it that\u2019s dangerous. There\u2019s all sorts of dark feelings that bubble up, a lot of sadness. Right now, we\u2019re just marching ahead.\u201d Melody Belloff, 60, a school nurse from Phoenix and volunteer for the American Red Cross Ms. Belloff carries a picture of her brother Bob, crestfallen in front of the charred remains of the house he lost to fire 22 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s my reminder,\u201d she said, \u201cof why I do this.\u201d In 2013, she cared for people and pets pushed out of Yarnell by the out-of-control fire at an emergency shelter south of town. She returned this week: different fire, different shelter, same toil. \u201cI know that the people of Yarnell went through a very difficult time three years ago, the uncertainty of not knowing if they had a home to go back to, the loss of the firemen. I feel a little bit protective of Yarnell,\u201d she said. Her eyes welled. \u201cIn Arizona, people are rugged individualists,\u201d Ms. Belloff said. \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes hard for them to ask for help. They like to do everything for themselves, to be self-sufficient. I\u2019m here for whoever needs me, you know?\u201d Carole Ryan, 68, a nutritional counselor and longtime resident of Yarnell Ms. Ryan\u2019s home of 36 years, an L-shaped structure flanked by oak and mulberry trees, was turned to ashes in 2013. She was out of the country when it happened and caught the first flight home from Prague. She remembers waiting for her luggage at the airport and thinking, \u201cThis may be everything I own.\u201d She had her luggage and, later, found her mother\u2019s wedding ring buried in the rubble of her house Ms. Ryan heard about this week\u2019s fire while at work on Wednesday. A day earlier, she had received the certificate of occupancy for the new house she built where the old one once stood. \u201cI got so worried about losing my new house,\u201d she said. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening again.\u201d Ben Palm, 43, chief of the Yarnell Fire Department Chief Palm received state and federal grants to pay for the hard work of thinning the wild vegetation on the east side of Yarnell. \u201cThe brush was so thick,\u201d he said, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t walk through it.\u201d The fire in 2013 had taken care of clearing the west side of town. The fire breaks built on the east side helped stop this week\u2019s fire. Yarnell is still on the mend from the damage of three years ago. Tax revenue is 25 percent lower than it was \u201cbefore everything changed\u201d in June 2013, Chief Palm said. The fire department has four full-time employees and 15 volunteers. \u201cCome January, I\u2019m probably going to have to cut some of the full-timers into part-timers,\u201d he said. \u201cHave to make ends meet.\u201d Deborah Pfingston, 56, whose son, Andrew Ashcraft, was one of the 19 firefighters killed in Yarnell in 2013 If any of Ms. Pfingston\u2019s sons ever gave her reason to worry, it was her older boy, TJ. He is a sergeant in the United States Army and has fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. She knew there was great risk to fighting wildfires, but never imagined that Andrew \u2014 her baby, the firefighter \u2014 would be the one she would lose. She thought, at first, that the fire in Yarnell she had heard about on the news was the one that burned three years ago. Driving south to the command post on Friday from her home in Prescott, Ms. Pfingston watched airplanes dropping chemicals and water to slow down the flames. She passed crew carriers just like those that carried her son and his crew, the Granite Mountain Hotshots. \u201cThe emotions are so complicated. But they\u2019re on it. They\u2019re on this fire and they\u2019re going to get it,\u201d she said.", "item_type": "Article"}
