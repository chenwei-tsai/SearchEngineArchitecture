{"text": "Surya Botofasina, 39, a keyboardist who lives in Brooklyn, has fond memories of growing up at the Shanti Anantam Ashram in Agoura, Calif., which was established in 1983 by Alice Coltrane, the jazz pianist, harpist and widow of the saxophone immortal John Coltrane. Mr. Botofasina\u2019s favorite times were Sundays at 1 p.m., when 40 to 50 participants would crowd into the ashram\u2019s temple and sit on pillows on the floor, with men on the left side of the room, women on the right and elders on chairs against the wall. Students wore white, while on the stage Ms. Coltrane \u2014 known to her students as Swamini Turiyasangitananda \u2014 wore orange robes so \u201cincredibly bright,\u201d Mr. Botofasina said, \u201cthat I felt like I had to hide from it, bright like the sun.\u201d After a spiritual discourse, Ms. Coltrane would begin to play a massive Hammond organ, cuing the singing of transcendental hymns called bhajans. This week, 10 years after Ms. Coltrane\u2019s death in 2007 at age 69, Luaka Bop will release the sounds of the ashram on \u201cWorld Spirituality Classics 1: The Ecstatic Music of Alice Coltrane Turiyasangitananda,\u201d a compilation culled from four cassettes she recorded between 1982 and 1995. Only available at the ashram, and now out of print, the cassettes have long been sought by collectors, selling for as much as $450 apiece on the internet. The collection illuminates a missing phase in Ms. Coltrane\u2019s remarkable musical journey from bebop to free jazz to New Age. \u201cOn most of the records we work on, the music isn\u2019t as revered as this is already,\u201d said Yale Evelev, Luaka Bop\u2019s president. \u201cThis has a certain amount of other weight that comes with it. It\u2019s sacred music.\u201d The newly remastered recordings feature Ms. Coltrane singing for the first time on record, leading a large choir through Eastern-influenced devotional music, with lyrics chanted in Sanskrit but shaped by the African-American church tradition. \u201cThat touch of gospel feeling in there never existed with the Hare Krishnas, I can promise you that,\u201d said Baker Bigsby, a Los Angeles audio engineer who worked with Ms. Coltrane for over 30 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of Detroit inserted into this Indian music.\u201d The bhajans would begin with a call-and-response chant of the names of Hindu gods, and then singers like Panduranga John Henderson, who had toured with Ray Charles, would solo as the songs built in an improvisational way. \u201cYou never knew how long the song was going to be,\u201d said Michelle Coltrane, Ms. Coltrane\u2019s daughter. \u201cThere was hand percussion, Indian drums, high voices and low voices and children\u2019s voices, and once you got to the right number it all blended in and sounded very beautiful.\u201d Alice Coltrane\u2019s great-nephew, Steven Ellison, who records as Flying Lotus, also visited Auntie, as he called her, on Sundays at the ashram. \u201cThat was my church experience,\u201d he said in a 2010 interview for The New York Times. \u201cShe was really inspiring. I\u2019ve never met anyone like her, ever.\u201d As Ms. Coltrane wrote in an insert for \u201cDivine Songs,\u201d a cassette released in 1990, \u201cchanting is a devotional engagement, one that allows the chanter to soar to higher realms of spiritual consciousness.\u201d Ms. Coltrane had long been an ecumenical spiritual seeker. She began playing the organ in Mount Olive Baptist Church in Detroit at 9, and made her first album appearance in 1963 on \u201cTerry Gibbs Plays Jewish Melodies in Jazztime.\u201d She soon met and began playing with John Coltrane, who died in 1967, leaving her a widow with four young children. In \u201cMonument Eternal,\u201d her 1977 memoir of her spiritual awakening, Ms. Coltrane describes the period after her husband\u2019s death as one of \u201ctapas,\u201d or austerity, \u201cthe taking upon one\u2019s self of a voluntary suffering for some spiritual good.\u201d She experienced sleeplessness, extreme weight loss, visions and, she wrote, \u201cmeetings and confrontations with both disembodied souls and phantasmagoric entities.\u201d After two years of tapas, she found peace in the counsel of Swami Satchidananda, the Indian guru who had given the opening remarks at Woodstock. Ms. Coltrane made several pilgrimages to India, where she received a revelation to leave her secular life behind. She founded the Vedantic Center in 1976 in San Francisco, which eventually relocated to the Agoura ashram in 1983. She changed her name to Turiyasangitananda (\u201cthe transcendent bliss of God\u2019s highest song\u201d), announcing it to her children by having them practice spelling it out with fridge magnets. Ms. Coltrane released seven albums on the Impulse! label in the late 1960s and early 1970s and five more for Warner Bros., each pushing beyond jazz into what might be termed \u201ccosmic music,\u201d the title of the 1968 album credited to her and Coltrane. After 1978, she devoted herself to the study of Vedic scriptures, and to the bhajans chronicled on the Luaka Bop collection. \u201cThis is music that she was playing every Sunday, so this was her life now,\u201d Michelle Coltrane said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t really going back.\u201d (In 2004, however, Ms. Coltrane was coaxed by her son Ravi to record one final jazz album, \u201cTranslinear Light,\u201d as well as to perform a few concerts.) As part of the New York edition of the Red Bull Music Academy Festival, Luaka Bop is presenting two concerts on May 21 in Queens that will try to recreate the ashram\u2019s vibe. Mr. Botofasina is the musical director of the first portion of the event, which will take place at sunset and feature a seven-member choir from the ashram, now called Sai Anantam. (Afterward, Ravi Coltrane, himself an acclaimed saxophonist, will lead a tribute to her jazz achievements.) \u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ll be attempting to stay very consistently with what she recorded,\u201d Mr. Botosafina said, \u201cand pay homage and re-enact that as accurately as possible.\u201d Just as the music is finally reaching a larger audience, however, the fate of the ashram, which is down to about a dozen members, is in doubt: The Coltrane estate put the land up for sale in 2015, though thus far there have been no takers at the $5 million asking price. \u201cThe ashram is ending, but the music is now becoming what the spiritual practice is, and I think that\u2019s an amazingly timed thing,\u201d Mr. Evelev said. \u201cThis music then also takes on this other life and hopefully gets to tour around the world, and the people who sang it then will continue to sing it.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/music/alice-coltrane-ashtram-world-spirituality-classics.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T14:43:38-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T14:43:38-04:00", "abstract": "Newly remastered versions from four rare cassettes are being released in a Luaka Bop compilation 10 years after the musician\u2019s death.", "title": "Alice Coltrane\u2019s Ashram Recordings Finally Have a Wide Release"}
