It was quiet, secluded in the bushes, a respite from life on the pavement downtown. Or at least it was until the storms came. \u201cI got flooded out,\u201d said Mr. Friend, 48, looking weary on a recent afternoon as he stood on the sidewalk he had escaped to a few blocks from the river. \u201cThis is the worst winter I\u2019ve known in the 10 years I\u2019ve been here. Last night and the night before I was just under a tarp, waiting it out. It was freezing-raining all night long.\u201d The rains that lashed California this year, continuing with yet another wave of downpours through last weekend, have pulled this state out of a historic drought. But they also exposed the extent and agony of homeless women and men who have long made homes along the banks of the now-swollen rivers across California, and particularly in Sacramento, a city of 480,000 where a largely hidden community has lived on the outskirts since the Great Depression. According to city and state officials, about 2,700 of the 18,000 homeless people in California live here. The rains \u2014 the most during California\u2019s rainy season since the state started keeping precipitation records nearly a century ago \u2014 overwhelmed the two rivers that converge on the northwest side of the city, the Sacramento and the American. They ripped away the cloak of shrubbery along the rivers\u2019 banks, forcing people camped there to move to more exposed ground. Cold, soaked and stranded, they used makeshift rafts to float to safety, or waited for rescue by the Fire Department from their camps two miles from the State Capitol and within walking distance of the Governor\u2019s Mansion. \u201cThe rivers rise, and people are flushed out of where they are staying,\u201d said Joan Burke, the advocacy director for Sacramento Loaves and Fishes, which provides food and other services for people living on the street. \u201cAll of a sudden they are visible to the rest of us.\u201d Homelessness draws more attention in big cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, where tents and sleeping bags crowd downtown sidewalks. But it has increasingly become a fact of life in suburbs and moderate-size cities like this one, places that often do not have the resources to manage it, and where the backlash to what was once seen as uniquely urban problems can be particularly intense. Two people died within a week just outside City Hall this winter, as they sought refuge from the rain and the cold. It was the kind of tragedy that might barely be noticed in a big city numb to people living on its street, but was deeply unsettling for this community. \u201cIt was a terrible thing for the people who were displaced,\u201d Ms. Burke said. \u201cBut the beneficial effect was the rest of us saw there are these huge number of homeless people in Sacramento who were suffering in this weather. And it just sort of crystallized for a lot of people that this is not O.K.\u201d \u201cKnock, knock.\u201d Cale Traylor stood a few feet away from a blue tent close to the American River, a dog barking in the background, late last month. The people who live here call themselves the River Dwellers, Mr. Traylor said, and he was once one himself. Mr. Traylor, 37, slept not far from this spot during a five-year binge of alcoholism, drug abuse, petty crime and homelessness. He knows how to navigate this world that was once his own: Keep a respectful distance when approaching; carry a bone to distract an unleashed pit bull that might come bounding out of the brush. There was a rustle inside the tent, and James Guidi, a Vietnam War veteran, emerged, a dazed look on his face. Mr. Guidi, 65, said the riverbanks had been his home for eight years, and he is one of the few who has stayed here through the winter. The night before, he slept in a tent left behind by someone who had wandered on. But earlier in the week he had to sleep on the ground as the storms blew through, tearing away the tarp that provided him scant protection. \u201cI slept in a puddle,\u201d Mr. Guidi said. \u201cIt was more terrible than any time I had in Vietnam. I can compare it to over there.\u201d Mr. Traylor\u2019s struggle with homelessness began when his father committed suicide in 2010, when he was 30, and continued until he was sent to the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi in 2015 for stealing a car and trying to outrace the police. When he disappeared after his father\u2019s death, his family wrote him off as a lost cause. Mr. Traylor said he was sober now, studying electronic automation at Sacramento City College. He sees his mother and sisters regularly. \u201cThere used to be a ton of cover,\u201d he said, pointing to a spot along the river. \u201cIt was an out-of-sight, out-of-mind mentality. If the police can\u2019t see you, then they typically leave you alone. When the water went up, it washed away all their coverage.\u201d Mr. Guidi said he didn\u2019t care that his campsite was largely deserted as people fled the rains. \u201cI\u2019ve been living by the river here and there, off and on, for eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople get along.\u201d Darrell Steinberg was elected mayor of Sacramento last year after stepping down as the leader of the California Senate, one of the three most powerful jobs in state government, because of term limits. Mr. Steinberg, 57, is a Democrat and ran for mayor on a pledge to help the homeless. He has lived in Sacramento for 32 years. The storms arrived with the start of his mayoralty in December. Those two deaths occurred shortly after he took office, and he responded by opening five warming centers for homeless people to escape to on cold nights. Over the past month, city and county officials have moved to create new housing and expand mental health and addiction treatment services. Mr. Steinberg argued that government should not force people to leave if there was no place for them to go. \u201cIt\u2019s our obligation to get to what we like to call net zero,\u201d he said. \u201cNet zero for us means we should have more housing and service opportunities than we have people.\u201d \u201cThis ought to be unacceptable to all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there has been a systematic belief that there is really nothing we can do about this except maybe maintain it. I refuse to believe that.\u201d But few people think that what has been done will be enough. And there has also been a surge of complaints from residents who are seeing homeless people in places where they had not been before. \u201cI hear about it every day,\u201d said Phil Serna, a Democratic member of the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors. He said the authorities should clear the banks for the safety of the homeless people and the rest of the community. \u201cI\u2019ve seen campsites where there are hundreds of needles scattered around,\u201d said Mr. Serna, who received a needle puncture wound when visiting a homeless camp in 2012. \u201cAs a kid I can remember riding my bike freely down there, not having to be worried about needles, not having to worry about being attacked by off-leash pit bulls.\u201d The storms have forced women like Susan Zemansky, 58, who has been homeless since she lost her job at a Subway sandwich shop four years ago, out of the bushes. Ms. Zemansky, peering out of a slit of her tent on a sidewalk on B Street, told of huddling for warmth as the rain pounded on her tent before she escaped. \u201cThe river was coming up way high,\u201d Ms. Zemansky said. \u201cThe rangers came and made us move. We had 20 minutes to get out of there, 20 minutes before we flooded.\u201d Ms. Zemansky is now easy to spot, another homeless person living along the street, watching the cars drive by. People stop by to offer supplies \u2014 \u201cbananas and stuff\u201d \u2014 and words of encouragement. But she said she was eager to return to her spot on the river. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of traffic here, and you\u2019ve got to get up every day and pack,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather be by the river. The river is peaceful. It is quiet.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T05:00:30-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/us/californias-deluge-of-rain-washes-away-a-homeless-colony.html", "item_type": "Article"}
