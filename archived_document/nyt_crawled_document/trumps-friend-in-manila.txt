This weekend, President Trump continued his bonhomie with Duterte. The two had a \u201cvery friendly conversation\u201d by phone, according to administration officials, and Trump invited Duterte to visit the White House. It was the second bit of whitewashing for Duterte this weekend. At a summit of Southeast Asia countries, none of the other leaders pressed him on the thousands of deaths he has overseen, as The Washington Post noted. I\u2019d encourage you to spend a few minutes understanding what\u2019s happening in the Philippines under Duterte. It\u2019s horrendous. Look at Berehulak\u2019s photography, which recently won the Pulitzer Prize.
