{"text": "TUESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 There\u2019s nothing more exciting than live theater (in my opinion), and today we get to see the curtain rise on some real winners. David J. Kahn is back, and he has compiled an elegant list of Tony Award-winning plays that all won for BEST MUSICAL, as the revealer says at 66A. Can\u2019t find them? Check out the first part of the two-word phrases in the theme entries. You\u2019ll know the theme entries by the bracketed year that the play won the Tony at the end of the clue. For example, the \u201cMarkswoman dubbed \u2018Little Sure Shot\u2019\u201d is ANNIE OAKLEY, and the bracketed year at the end of the clue is [1977], the year that ANNIE won for BEST MUSICAL. Similarly, at 11D, \u201c400 meters, for an Olympic track\u201d is a ONCE AROUND, and the play ONCE won in [2012]. The nice thing about this is that Mr. Kahn was able to intersect the long Down theme entries with two other theme entries: ONCE AROUND plunges through NINE BALL and the central HAMILTON, BERMUDA and COMPANY MAN intersects HAMILTON BERMUDA and RENT ROLL. \u25a038A: I couldn\u2019t think of a three-letter muscle that would make a good \u201cMassage target?\u201d, could you? The thing being massaged in this puzzle is the EGO. \u25a0 59A: \u201cWinds down in a pit\u201d was my favorite clue today. It sounds like a bid to chill out in a pit, but it\u2019s not. Today, the winds are OBOES in the orchestra pit. \u25a0 8D: There are a few silent film stars that pop up in crosswords, and it\u2019s good to know some of them. Today we once again meet Nita NALDI. \u25a0 13D: Playing with clay was never the same after the introduction of MR. BILL on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Here is the answer key to today\u2019s puzzle.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/crosswords/rallying-cry.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Crosswords & Games", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T22:00:27-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T22:00:27-04:00", "abstract": "David J.
