It was on the flange of a nostril on the right side of his face. Most every ordinary person has, of course, awakened at some time to an angry and embarrassing eruption. But the movie star was no ordinary person. It was the third week of February. The Oscars were just days away. The actor was to present a big award. Easy enough for civilians to conceal or suffer, a pimple takes on major proportions when it happens to someone whose image will be scrutinized by 32.9 million viewers under the pitiless gaze of high-definition television. Thus, the actor found himself one winter afternoon on a padded baby-blue exam table in the sunny offices of a dermatologist, a syringe filled with lidocaine and cortisone directed toward his nose. The person wielding the syringe, Dr. Peter Kopelson, 54, is a rumpled bear with pierced ears and whiskered jeans who, although he would not make the claim himself, belongs to a small group of medical professionals responsible for keeping the most recognizable faces on the planet looking always young, or at least, \u201cwell rested,\u201d and also pimple free. In the entertainment industry \u2014 now, as always \u2014 who one knows is of substantially greater relevance than what, a truth extending to the agent who selects your scripts and the trainer who tones your thighs and the dentist who bleaches your teeth. \u201cThere is a real mafia\u201d of caretakers charged with the maintenance of boldfaced deities, said John Goldwyn, a film and television producer whose industry lineage qualifies him for that rarefied elite known here as Hollywood royalty. If at the pinnacle of this aristocracy are people named Huston, Barrymore or Goldwyn, at a minor step down stands a person like Dr. Kopelson, who was raised in Beverly Hills and on the sets of the 29 movies produced by his father, Arnold Kopelson, and his mother, Anne. Between them, the two have made films that have garnered 17 Oscar nominations (and a win, in 1987, with Oliver Stone\u2019s \u201cPlatoon\u201d). Even now, at 82, Mr. Kopelson has enough industry heft to command a view table at the Tower Bar \u2014 that is, provided Jennifer Aniston doesn\u2019t get there first. \u201cMy father still refuses to understand why she gets a better table than he does,\u201d Dr. Kopelson said. On a cold, drizzly evening, Dimitri Dimitrov, the beloved ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel at the Tower Bar, greeted Dr. Kopelson in so fawning and grateful a way that, as the producer Brian Grazer once noted, it is impossible to thank him last. Shown to an alcove table, the physician had a ringside seat on a room full of well-toned faces \u2014 some identifiable to anyone, some recognizable mostly to show business cognoscenti, a certain number familiar to Dr. Kopelson at an intimate and even microscopic level. There was a former cinematic superhero whose recent career comeback owes much to his miraculous state of preservation. There was a bulldog Hollywood divorce lawyer with runway-model looks. There was a studio head and a B-list actress and an Academy Award-winning director and a rubber-faced comedian who specializes in angst. What unified these people, beyond their obvious business connections, is how fresh they all appeared, how unlined and dewy, as if each had just awakened from a restorative nap. \u201cI can\u2019t ethically tell you who I treat,\u201d Dr. Kopelson said as he surveyed the room. Yet his client list is sufficiently stellar that some here refer to him as the next big celebrity dermatologist, the likely successor to the late Dr. Arnold Klein, a publicity-loving physician best known for having treated Michael Jackson, or Dr. Fredric Brandt, the Manhattan dermatologist to whom Dr. Kopelson often lent his Beverly Hills office whenever Madonna summoned Dr. Brandt to town. \u201cThe world is always \u2014 always \u2014 looking for a star dermatologist,\u201d said Joan Kron, a journalist and filmmaker who spent decades chronicling the worlds of surgical and dermatologic cosmetic medicine for magazines like New York and Allure. \u201cThere\u2019s always this tremendous desire to find the best, though, basically, it\u2019s hard to know who the best is.\u201d Until his death in 2015, many in the entertainment industry viewed Dr. Brandt as that person. A quirky cosmetic dermatologist whose self-administered experiments with rejuvenating substances led to the creation of a buffoonish character on a Netflix show (and, it was suggested, his eventual suicide), Dr. Brandt\u2019s not-so-secret client list included some of the most famous faces in the world. \u201cFred had this tremendous, loyal following and he served them very well,\u201d Ms. Kron said. \u201cPart of it was service \u2014 flying to London for Madonna every time she needed an injection. That was nice.\u201d In data compiled by the American Academy of Dermatology, its 11,000 practicing members reported spending no more than 8 percent of their office time on cosmetic procedures, a figure that skews differently in a town like Los Angeles, where, as Sandra Ballentine, the beauty editor at large for W magazine, said, \u201cAll the smart people have a regular regimen of \u00e0 la carte treatments where, instead of going invasive with plastic surgery, they do a little something here, a little something there, every month.\u201d While Dr. Kopelson may not be a \u201cbig self-promoter,\u201d as Ms. Ballentine added: \u201cHe is one of those Hollywood doctors that people say, \u2018Oh, you need to see him if you\u2019re having work done. He\u2019s the one.\u2019\u201d For Kevin Connolly, an actor and director best known for his role in the HBO series \u201cEntourage,\u201d visits to Dr. Kopelson are as much part of a regimen \u201cas going to the dentist,\u201d self-maintenance being part of an actor\u2019s job description and aging the enemy of all in a youth-obsessed field. \u201cYou kind of have to try to get out in front of it,\u201d Mr. Connolly said in a phone interview. Still, his visits to Dr. Kopelson are not, he said, for the purpose of being injected with, say, $800 vials of Botox or to have a $475 Genesis laser treatment for pore tightening, or a $1,200 session with a Titan laser to keep his jawline firm. Like every Hollywood person interviewed for this article, Mr. Connolly claimed to see a dermatologist only to keep an eye on suspicious moles. \u201cWhen you look at people in Hollywood now, it\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at an athlete at the peak of performance,\u201d said Linda Wells, the chief creative officer at Revlon and former editor in chief of Allure. In the entertainment industry, she added: \u201cThe bar is set so high now that their skin has to be perfection. Their toes have to be perfect. They are perfect on the bottoms of their feet.\u201d In the age of Instagram, when every famous face is potentially subject to an iPhone ambush, extreme vanity is more necessity than sin. \u201cSuddenly you find your image is up on someone else\u2019s feed,\u201d Ms. Wells said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t take it down.\u201d \u201cYes, people are much more conscious of every aspect of their appearance,\u201d Dr. Kopelson said one sunny morning at the medical suite he shares with Dr. Sheri Feldman, a former professional partner of Dr. Klein. \u201cTake hair removal. Suddenly straight men are really into getting hair removed from around their genitals. I, personally, don\u2019t really get it, but I think they\u2019re being pushed by their wives.\u201d Located a block west of Rodeo Drive, Dr. Kopelson\u2019s office is paparazzi-proof, connected by an elevator bank to an underground garage. Decorated with the sprightly sterility of a Swiss clinic as imagined by Stanley Kubrick, the suite is filled with art pieces from the physician\u2019s collection by Ross Bleckner, Jean Cocteau, Catherine Opie and David Shrigley. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to be a celebrity physician,\u201d said the celebrity physician, an assertion made somewhat more credible in light of the fact that, unlike his competition, he employs no publicist, has a negligible social media presence and has yet to make breakfast appearances at a department store. Burly, bearded, with multiple earrings and an experimental buzz cut, Dr. Kopelson shares a resemblance to Dr. Brandt in at least one way: He tests many of the fillers he employs on himself. Unlike Dr. Brandt, though, whose face was as smooth and unmarked as a baby\u2019s behind, Dr. Kopelson is a human coloring book. \u201cThe tattoos are all about members of my family,\u201d Dr. Kopelson said, pulling off a snug T-shirt, the better to display the large ivory pagoda inked down the length of his spine. The pagoda is a souvenir in flesh of an antique willed to him by his maternal grandfather, a onetime pushcart vendor on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Concealed in its latticework are the names of that grandfather, Jack, and his wife, Belle. On Dr. Kopelson\u2019s bicep is a rendering of a pendant he wears, which contains the stone from his mother\u2019s engagement ring. Scaling his chest is a tiger with its claws sunk into his neck. Opposite it is an image of a crystal deer figurine with a broken antler, a remembrance of a similar one given to him as a child. The Polynesian-style decorative sleeve covering one forearm has no sentimental significance. \u201cWhat about the piano?\u201d Dr. Kopelson asked and then dropped his pants. There, along his right thigh, was a multicolor drawing of a keyboard held in the grip of a stylized dragon, its yellow tongue disappearing into the physician\u2019s shorts: \u201cI played as a child.\u201d Single and gay, Dr. Kopelson lives in the flats of West Hollywood, Calif., in a Spanish-style house from the 1920s that he shares with a rescue mutt and three West Highland terriers. The drug abuse issues that briefly threatened to derail his professional career are 15 years into the past, he said, and these days he is part of an extended recovery network that probably includes a few of the celebrities he sees professionally. In a clubby town, intersections like that are all but inevitable. As Mr. Goldwyn noted, it is common Hollywood practice to pass along the names of your best people, from your manager at Creative Artists Agency to the doctor who can treat your zit. \u201cIt\u2019s like sharing military secrets with your allies,\u201d he said.", "item_type": "Article"}
