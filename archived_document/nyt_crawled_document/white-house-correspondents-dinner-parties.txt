{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It was not so long ago \u2014 was it really just last year? \u2014 that the three-day, Hollywood-fueled party apparatus surrounding the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner was nearly as talked about as the dinner itself, if only for the odd-couple-style mingling of journalists, celebrities and elected officials, and for the reliable complaints that the whole thing was much too cozy for comfort. This year, to the delight of critics and the dismay of partygoers, the bubble popped. Sort of. President Trump left town \u2014 offering his own bit of counterprogramming with another diatribe against the news media \u2014 and the Hollywood cool factor that had accumulated during the Obama years was all but gone. The weekend\u2019s most glamorous parties were canceled months ago, and hotel rooms were still available and cheap. But on rooftops, in bars and in the tented backyards of the nation\u2019s capital, the parties went on, bookending two main events: the actual correspondents\u2019 dinner and a televised special hosted by the comedian Samantha Bee, which celebrated a free press, criticized the president and continued to mourn the loss of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump might have abstained from the weekend, but, really, he was present at every event: The minute-to-minute media saturation achieved by his administration was the conversational backdrop as partygoers tried to either make fun or make sense of his presidency. A telling Washington scene unfolded at a high-profile dinner party on Friday evening, in the backyard of a home owned by David Bradley, the owner of Atlantic Media, and his wife, Katherine: Most of the Trump administration had shunned the weekend\u2019s festivities in solidarity with their boss, but Defense Secretary Jim Mattis attended the party, taking his seat at the same table as the billionaire Richard Branson and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia Democrat. As plates of grapefruit salad were laid out on floral tablecloths, the defense secretary kept his eyes on his meal as well-known journalists debated among themselves whether a war with North Korea was possible. \u201cYou probably all got alerts on your phone that they launched another missile tonight,\u201d Martha Raddatz of ABC News said. Dinner guests nodded and showed one another their phones: Like clockwork, the president had sent out a Twitter message admonishing North Korea. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, cracked a joke: \u201cIf Jim Mattis leaves suddenly, we\u2019re going to move the party to the basement.\u201d The lobbyist Heather Podesta, who looked only slightly bored, watched the discussion, and said that in a normal year, she would not have had time to stay through dinner. But this year, she reasoned, \u201cthere are a third of the parties.\u201d On Saturday, the will to give a party held strong, even as the president prepared to gleefully assail the news media from a farm expo center in Pennsylvania. A long-running brunch, organized by the media consultant Tammy Haddad and held at a private home, drew a crowd of prominent political journalists, including Greta Van Susteren of MSNBC and Bret Baier, the Fox News anchor; politicians; and a handful of military veterans. On a private list of attendees guarded by organizers, people were sorted into color-coded categories: Entertainment, Media, Influential. The mood was tribal. \u201c364 days of the year they\u2019re competing with each other,\u201d Ms. Haddad said of the news media. \u201cI think journalists and influentials are looking at each other with a deep appreciation we\u2019ve never bothered with before.\u201d Near the front door, Valerie Jarrett, the former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, hovered with her daughter, Laura, who covers the Justice Department for CNN. The two were planning to attend Ms. Bee\u2019s taping later, which was part comic relief and part therapy session for those who long for the days of the Obama White House. Ms. Jarrett said she had been indulging in a bit of nostalgia herself by keeping tabs on the former White House photographer Pete Souza\u2019s Instagram account, which contains not-so-subtle digs at Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious,\u201d she said. Crunching down the gravel driveway was Mr. Warner, one of the few elected officials to attend, along with Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, who will face a tough election next year. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go inside,\u201d Mr. Warner said to a photographer, quickly crossing the threshold into the home, which the organizers firmly said was off-the-record territory. Inside the party, where a mimosa bar and a wall full of doughnuts served as Instagram fodder, a brave soul said he would speak freely: It was the actor Matt Walsh, who plays the former White House press secretary on the HBO comedy \u201cVeep.\u201d \u201cWe weren\u2019t planning on coming,\u201d said Mr. Walsh, who attended with his wife. \u201cTammy roped us in.\u201d After Ms. Bee taped her show and the \u201cDaily Show\u201d comedian Hasan Minhaj gave hundreds of journalists tough love at the correspondents\u2019 dinner, a younger crowd took over a local bar at BuzzFeed\u2019s \u201cRed, White and Banned\u201d party, where Mr. Minhaj and the commentator Melissa Harris-Perry were spotted mingling with guests. Across town, while journalists descended on the NBC News and MSNBC after-party at the Organization of American States building, Hollywood types \u2014 the ones who came, anyway \u2014 turned up for Ms. Bee at the W Hotel, where cocktails like the Bad Hombre, the Nasty Woman and the Orange Russian reminded attendees which type of party they were attending. Sitting near a giant illuminated sign that read, \u201cFREE PRESS,\u201d Will Ferrell, who had reprised his George W. Bush impersonation earlier in the day at Ms. Bee\u2019s taping, did not feel like talking. The comedians Retta and Ana Gasteyer were in attendance. \u201cI don\u2019t have the energy for this heat,\u201d Retta said of the 90-degree weather. Other actors were recognizable but tricky for partygoers to identify by name. (It was a running theme of the weekend.) \u201cHer face looks familiar, but I don\u2019t know her,\u201d a man whispered about a woman in an orange dress and jade-colored earrings. She turned out to be Alia Shawkat, the actress who played Maeby F\u00fcnke in \u201cArrested Development.\u201d Ms. Shawkat said the past few months had been tough for those in the arts. \u201cBut this feels light and fun,\u201d she added. Padma Lakshmi, the host of \u201cTop Chef,\u201d said that she and her date, Adam Dell, had to develop a \u201csafe word\u201d to keep themselves from talking too much about Mr. Trump. What was it? They could not think of it. \u201c\u2018Stop it?\u2019\u201d Ms. Lakshmi offered. As the evening stretched on, there was plenty of room to roam as Elvis Costello took the stage to perform. On the rooftop, Ms. Bee, in a black dress, tried to make her way through an adoring crowd with the help of a security guard. The mood in Washington might be an \u201cinterplanetary\u201d change from how it was a year ago, Ms. Bee said, but in this moment, she just felt relief. \u201cAnything that goes well for me as a performer is a good night,\u201d Ms. Bee said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/politics/white-house-correspondents-dinner-parties.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T19:36:39-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T19:31:05-04:00", "abstract": "The Hollywood cool factor of the Obama years was all but gone, but people came out to celebrate the press and the weekend\u2019s other hero, Samantha Bee.", "title": "Finding the Will to Party on a Muted Correspondents\u2019 Weekend"}
