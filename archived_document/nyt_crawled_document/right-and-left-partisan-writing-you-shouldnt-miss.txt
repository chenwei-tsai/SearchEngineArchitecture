Williamson in National Review: \u201cTo call it \u2018economic nationalism\u2019 would be too grand: It is merely a very narrow form of special-interest politics consisting of backdoor handouts to favored corporate interests.\u201d Kevin Williamson takes issue with President Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order. Connecting the protectionist economic policy to the \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d of the Obama administration, he argues that the order is nothing but \u201canother exciting distraction,\u201d that might result in \u201cperfectly legal corruption.\u201d Read more \u00bb _____ \u2022 John Carney in Breitbart: \u201cThe wealth and welfare of a country consist of more than its income.\u201d John Carney, making the \u201clibertarian case\u201d for President Trump\u2019s executive order, rejects the view that it will lead to crony capitalism. Mr. Carney, who recently joined Breitbart News from The Wall Street Journal, explains that it merely represents Americans expressing \u201ctheir spending policy preferences.\u201d Taken together, Mr. Williamson and Mr. Carney\u2019s articles reflect a stark divide in how conservative columnists have reacted to the order.

Matthew Continetti sees hypocrisy in granting Mr. Cook this award after Apple acquiesced to a Chinese government request to remove The New York Times from the Chinese version of the App Store. And he notes that Apple is a \u201cplatinum sponsor\u201d of the Newseum\u2019s Free Expression awards. Read more \u00bb _____ \u2022 Bill Donohue in Newsmax: \u201cWhat are they afraid of? That the playground is going to be converted into some kind of grand venue for Bible readings?\u201d On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that may have resounding implications for the separation of church and state. At the heart of the case is whether the state can deny funds to a religious organization that seeks to use them for secular purpose. In 2012, a Missouri church sought state money to resurface a playground and was denied. Bill Donohue, who leads the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, argues that the brief filed against the church \u201chas an air of paranoia to it,\u201d and misunderstands the historical context behind the Missouri Constitution\u2019s religious provisions.

While some on the left wing of the party worried that Mr. Perez would continue a Clinton brand of centrism, Mr. Nichols sees Mr. Perez\u2019s history of labor rights advocacy as an asset. To defeat President Trump and other Republicans, Mr. Nichols writes, the Democrats must change and become more militant in their economic policy. Read more \u00bb _____ \u2022 Moira Donegan in The New Republic: \u201cThe problem with using the tax returns as a symbol for all of Trump\u2019s corruption is that the returns themselves may be less than earth shattering.\u201d Moira Donegan warns liberals not to put too much stock in potential revelations hidden in President Trump\u2019s tax returns. She points out that the president\u2019s base has overlooked many scandals that would have easily taken other politicians down. \u201cUnless the returns show direct bank deposits from Vladimir Putin,\u201d she writes, there\u2019s little in them that is likely to remove the president from power.

[...] It is white supremacy that decided that it was worth a book deal, national news coverage, and yes \u2014 even this interview.\u201d Ijeoma Oluo didn\u2019t want to write about Rachel Dolezal, the former head of a N.A.A.C.P. chapter who \u201cpassed\u201d as a black woman for nearly a decade until she was \u201couted\u201d as white. But we\u2019re glad she did. In this profile, Ms. Oluo confronts a woman she believes profoundly misunderstands the nature of white privilege. In the process, Ms. Oluo lets go of her anger toward Ms. Dolezal and comes to a deeper understanding of the nature of white supremacy.

You\u2019ll definitely want to read it if you hate the show. Mr. Savage explains how the show\u2019s valorization of pragmatism and process, rather than any specific policy or ideological gains, is the idealized state of establishment liberal politics. It reflects the smug view that \u201cpolitics is less a terrain of clashing values and interests than a perpetual pitting of the clever against the ignorant and obtuse.\u201d Read more \u00bb _____ \u2022 Taffy Brodesser-Akner in GQ: \u201cHow, in an age of lies, does a guy make righteous truth-telling so damn entertaining?\u201d Jake Tapper has been holding people in power accountable long before the video of his 11-minute interview with Kellyanne Conway went viral. It\u2019s only now that people have begun to notice. In this profile of the CNN anchor, Taffy Brodesser-Akner introduces her readers to the man who criticized the Obama administration for attempting to deny Fox News access, the man who \u201chas been doing outrage since back when you believed you lived in a free country.\u201d Read more \u00bb _____ \u2022 Robert J. Samuelson in The Washington Post: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled: There is no strong consensus on trade.\u201d Are Americans done with free trade? It depends on whom you ask. Robert J. Samuelson explains how attitudes toward globalization are hard to pin down but easy to manipulate. The only thing we can be sure of? \u201cAmericans\u2019 attitudes on trade seem confusing, inconsistent and variable because they are confusing, inconsistent and variable.\u201d Read more \u00bb _____ \u2022 Caitlin Flanagan in The Atlantic: \u201cNothing about this time is elevating. It\u2019s just all of us \u2014 on the left and on the right \u2014 sworn to our bitterness and our anger.\u201d A new genre of political writing has emerged seeking to explain and, occasionally, assign blame for \u201cthe rise of Trump.\u201d Caitlin Flanagan details the part that late-night comedy played. Political comedians like Samantha Bee or John Oliver, she writes, alienated conservatives and made liberal viewers too smug. Late-night satire reflects the hyperpartisan nature of our nation, \u201cwith all of us being judged by how well [...] we can hate each other.\u201d Read more \u00bb _____ Want the Partisan Writing Roundup in your inbox?
