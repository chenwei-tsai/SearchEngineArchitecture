{"text": "Welcome to Times Insider Events \u2014 live programming for Times Insiders and their guests. Times Insider offers behind-the-scenes insights into news, features and opinion at The New York Times. How do obituary writers do it? How do they capture a life in 500 words \u2014 and do it on deadline? In this exclusive Times Insider event, Bill McDonald, The Times\u2019s obituary editor, and Margalit Fox, an obituary writer, join the filmmaker Vanessa Gould \u2014 creator of the award-winning film \u201cObit\u201d \u2014 to discuss the art of the fair and balanced post-mortem appraisal. The Times journalist Melena Ryzik leads the discussion, delving into how individual writers approach their craft; what it\u2019s like to interview the friends and family of the recently deceased; and the truth behind obituaries supposedly written in advance of a person\u2019s passing.
