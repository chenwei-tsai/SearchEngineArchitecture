{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump issued a sweeping review of federal education policies on Wednesday in an executive order to pinpoint areas where the government may be overstepping in shaping operations of local school systems. The order requires Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump\u2019s education secretary, to review, modify and possibly repeal any regulations and guidelines that are not consistent with federal law. Mr. Trump described the order as \u201canother critical step to restoring local control,\u201d and one that fulfills one of his campaign promises. \u201cFor too long, the federal government has imposed its will on state and local governments,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference to sign the order. \u201cThe result has been education that spends more, and achieves far, far, far less.\u201d The review will be conducted within 300 days, and its findings will be published in a public report. It aims to ensure local leaders will have the final say \u201cabout what happens in the classroom,\u201d said Rob Goad, a senior Education Department official. Ms. DeVos is already empowered to rescind guidance and regulations, and has already done so, and any attempt at overturning laws would be subjected to a legal, regulatory process. In an interview, Ms. DeVos called Mr. Trump\u2019s order a \u201cwelcomed opportunity\u201d and \u201ca clear mandate to take that real hard look at what we\u2019ve been doing at the department level that we shouldn\u2019t be doing, and what ways we have overreached.\u201d She said Mr. Trump had already espoused \u201cthe importance of states and localities\u2019 being able to address issues that are closest to them.\u201d \u201cAnd when it comes to education, decisions made at local levels and at state levels are the best ones,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. The review will focus on K-12 policy, Mr. Goad said. It will be overseen by a regulatory task force headed by Robert Eitel, who was hired from the for-profit sector to serve as a special assistant to Ms. DeVos. Mr. Eitel is a vocal critic of regulations in higher-education and K-12 policy, and his hiring was controversial. A New York Times investigation found that before he took his post in the Education Department, Mr. Eitel spent 18 months as a top lawyer for a company facing multiple government investigations, including one that ended with a settlement of more than $30 million over deceptive student lending. Mr. Trump\u2019s order was lauded by the Center for Education Reform, which advocates school-choice policies. In a statement, its founder, Jeanne Allen, said that conducting the review was \u201cpart and parcel of ensuring that education innovation, and opportunity, are able to take root throughout our various education sectors.\u201d \u201cThe process will also allow the public to learn just how much oversight occurs as a result of bureaucracy, not law, and pave the way for all schools to focus on outcomes, not compliance,\u201d Ms. Allen said. But other observers said the order stands to have little impact on large-scale reforms already underway, such as the Every Student Succeeds Act, and bedrock laws like the Individuals with Disabilities Act, which governs the education of special education students. And the Common Core standards, which neither Ms. DeVos nor Mr. Trump supports, were adopted by states at their own volition. \u201cThe bottom line is that the law is still the law, and an executive order can\u2019t override that,\u201d said Kelly McManus, interim director of legislative affairs at the Education Trust, a Washington think tank. Ms. McManus said the organization is also concerned about the Education Department\u2019s watchdog role being diminished. \u201cThe good states need the cover of the federal government, and the bad actors need to be pushed by the federal government,\u201d she said. Where the order could have the most impact is in the area of civil rights, in which the Obama administration issued a series of guidance documents. One of the Trump administration\u2019s first acts was rescinding earlier Education Department guidelines that urged states to allow transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Wade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, called Mr. Trump\u2019s order \u201cdangerous and wrongheaded.\u201d \u201cState and local primacy without federal oversight in America\u2019s schools has never worked for all children and will not work now,\u201d Mr. Henderson said in a scathing statement.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/trump-education-policy-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T20:56:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T20:56:54-04:00", "abstract": "The review aims to ensure local leaders will have final say \u201cabout what happens in the classroom,\u201d said Rob Goad, a senior Education Department official.", "title": "Trump Orders Review of Education Policies to Strengthen Local Control"}
