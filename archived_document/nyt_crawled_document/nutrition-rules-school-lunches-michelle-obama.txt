{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rolling back Michelle Obama\u2019s signature initiative as first lady, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on Monday that school lunches would no longer have to meet some of Mrs. Obama\u2019s dietary guidelines calling for healthy meals that include skim milk and whole grains. Mr. Perdue said school districts would be granted flexibility from rules rolled out by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, which sought to improve nutrition for students who receive federally subsidized meals. The regulations were part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, and they were advocated by Mrs. Obama as part of her \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign. They required school districts to cut calories, fat, salt and sugar and offer more whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. But since schools began complying with the nutrition rules in 2012, many have complained that they are too stringent and costly. \u201cThis announcement is the result of years of feedback from students, schools and food service experts about the challenges they are facing in meeting the final regulations for school meals,\u201d Mr. Perdue said in a statement. \u201cIf kids aren\u2019t eating the food, and it\u2019s ending up in the trash, they aren\u2019t getting any nutrition \u2014 thus undermining the intent of the program.\u201d Mr. Perdue said the regulations had cost school districts an additional $1.22 billion since 2014, and schools report that participation in the federal meals program has declined. Mr. Perdue signed a proclamation on Monday after having lunch with students at Catoctin Elementary School in Leesburg, Va. In the coming academic year, states will be allowed to grant schools an exemption from the rule requiring 100 percent grain products, and through 2020, schools will not be required to substantially reduce the amount of salt in meals they serve. And instead of nonfat flavored milk, schools will be able to offer 1 percent. Before Mr. Perdue\u2019s announcement, childhood nutrition advocates were wary of rolling back any of the guidelines. Nancy Brown, chief executive of the American Heart Association, said in a statement that schools had made marked progress in meeting the standards. \u201cRather than altering the current path forward, we hope the agency focuses more on providing technical assistance that can help schools get across the finish line, if they haven\u2019t done so already,\u201d Ms. Brown said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/nutrition-rules-school-lunches-michelle-obama.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T17:00:19-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T17:00:19-04:00", "abstract": "Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced that school lunches would no longer have to meet some of the Obama administration\u2019s dietary guidelines.", "title": "Nutrition Rules for School Lunches Are Rolled Back"}
