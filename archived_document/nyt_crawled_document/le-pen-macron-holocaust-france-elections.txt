{"text": "PARIS \u2014 Marine Le Pen\u2019s bid for the French presidency suffered a setback on Friday when the ally she had chosen to temporarily lead her far-right party was forced to step down because he had praised a Holocaust denier and had expressed doubt that the Nazis had used poison gas to murder Jews. Ms. Le Pen on Friday morning called the outrage directed at Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jalkh, her choice for interim leader of the National Front, a \u201cdefamation.\u201d She had advanced on Sunday to the May 7 run-off election, and announced on Monday that she would temporarily step down as party leader to focus on defeating the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, considered to be the favorite in the race. At a rally Thursday night, she had tried to refocus the campaign on Mr. Macron, a former investment banker and economy minister, whom she has condemned as a \u201cglobalist\u201d and \u201cimmigrationist,\u201d but she did not address the controversy until Friday morning. She also has been trying to \u201cun-demonize\u201d her party, and the legacy of anti-Semitic and racist comments made by the party\u2019s founder, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Expelled from the party in 2015, he once called the Nazi gas chambers a \u201cdetail\u201d of history. And Ms. Le Pen herself prompted an outcry earlier in the presidential campaign when she said that France had not been responsible the roundup of Parisian Jews in an event known as the Vel\u2019 d\u2019Hiv during World War II. But her efforts to buff her party\u2019s image were complicated this week by a furor over comments made in 2000 by Mr. Jalkh. During an interview, a doctoral student, Magali Boumaza, had asked him about the gas chambers. She said that Mr. Jalkh replied that he wasn\u2019t a \u201cnegationist\u201d but that he had read the works of a \u201ctrustworthy revisionist\u201d \u2014 Robert Faurisson, a former professor of history at the University of Lyon who has been convicted of inciting hatred and racial discrimination and who has often been cited by the more extreme far-right elements. Mr. Jalkh, who once took part in a ceremony commemorating the death of Philippe P\u00e9tain, the leader of the Vichy government that collaborated with Nazi Germany, said in the interview that he had been \u201csurprised\u201d by the \u201crigor \u201c and \u201cconscientiousness\u201d of Mr. Faurisson\u2019s research. Mr. Jalkh also said Zyklon B, the gas used to kill millions of Jews during the Holocaust would have been \u201cimpossible\u201d to use in \u201cmass exterminations.\u201d Revelations that Mr. Jalkh, who is also a member of the European Parliament and a vice president of the National Front, had praised a Holocaust denier quickly prompted the party to react, fearful that his comments might cast a shadow on Ms. Pen\u2019s campaign. Mr. Jalkh agreed to resign as party chairman to help calm the controversy, Louis Aliot, a vice president of the party, said Friday morning on the French channel BFMTV, announcing that Steeve Briois, the mayor of H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, a National Front stronghold in northern France, would replace Mr. Jalkh. Mr. Jalkh, who also faced accusations of campaign finance violations related to Ms. Le Pen\u2019s failed 2012 presidential bid, has denied giving the interview, according to Le Monde. But Ms. Boumaza, now a researcher in Istanbul, told BuzzFeed that she had recorded the comments, which were made during a three-hour interview at National Front headquarters, and that she still had the tapes. The interview had been published in an academic journal, Le Temps des Savoirs (The Time of Knowledge). Mr. Aliot said on BFMTV that Mr. Jalkh wanted to \u201cdefend himself; he\u2019s going to press charges because he estimates that his honor is being sullied, and I can tell you that he firmly and formally contests what he\u2019s being reproached with.\u201d Ms. Le Pen\u2019s temporary departure from the helm of the party was part of an effort to extend her reach to the disillusioned supporters of the firebrand leftist Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who failed to reach the run-off stage of the election. Many of his supporters share a distaste for elites, and for globalization. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, who faced harsh criticism for refusing to endorse Mr. Macron after the first round of the election, was expected to make an announcement on YouTube later on Friday. In a video posted on Twitter, Ms. Le Pen called on Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s supporters voters to \u201cobstruct\u201d Mr. Macron. Acknowledging \u201cprofound discords\u201d with her opponent in the race, she added that she, too, aimed to rein in \u201cthe world of finance, of powerful lobbies and of \u201cEuropean technocrats.\u201d \u201cFrench politics are not only about the Holocaust. It\u2019s an important topic, because it has to do with the memory of the Second World War, but it\u2019s not an everyday issue when you are president,\u201d Jean-Yves Camus, a scholar of far-right politics and director of the Observatory of Radical Politics at the Jean Jaur\u00e8s Foundation, told journalists on Thursday. It was difficult to estimate the impact of the Jalkh controversy on Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign, which has centered thus far on a bitter competition between Ms. Le Pen\u2019s protectionist views and Mr. Macron\u2019s support for globalization and the European Union. The economy is at top of the country\u2019s priorities and security is also a major issue. While Ms. Le Pen was still trailing in opinion polls, which forecast that she would not get more than 38 to 40 percent of the votes, her campaign had gained momentum after the first round. Her father, meanwhile, has refused to stay in the shadows. In a video published Thursday on his blog, Mr. Le Pen expressed disapproval of a speech made by the civil partner of a gay police officer who was killed in a terrorist attack in Paris last week, saying the eulogy had honored \u201cthe homosexual\u201d rather than \u201cthe policeman.\u201d Ms. Le Pen reacted by telling reporters that she had been \u201cdeeply touched\u201d by the speech given by the slain officer\u2019s civil partner at a ceremony on Tuesday honoring him. On Wednesday, Ms. Le Pen appeared to upstage Mr. Macron when she visited a threatened Whirlpool plant in northern France, snapping selfies with amiable workers while he spoke with union members nearby. Mr. Macron traveled on Friday afternoon to Oradour-sur-Glane, a village in central France, where an SS division set the town on fire in 1944 and killed 642 people. There Mr. Macron met Robert H\u00e9bras, the only remaining survivor of the massacre. Mr. Macron came under criticism on Friday when Maria Zakhavora, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said that his team had denied accreditation to the pro-Kremlin news media outlets Sputnik, RT and Ruptly. It was not clear whether the denial of accreditation had any link to recent reports that Russian operatives had targeted Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign. Russian operatives have also been linked to the hacking of Democratic Party officials before the November presidential election in the United States.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/world/europe/le-pen-macron-holocaust-france-elections.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T12:25:39-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T12:25:39-04:00", "abstract": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jalkh was forced to step down as interim leader of the far-right National Front, the party of the presidential candidate Marine Le Pen.", "title": "Le Pen Aide Is Fired Over Holocaust Comments"}
