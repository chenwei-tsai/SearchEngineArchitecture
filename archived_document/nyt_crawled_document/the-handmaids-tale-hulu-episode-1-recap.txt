{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "Washed-out colors \u2014 moss green, dusty blue, sunlight like aged parchment \u2014 give the premiere episode of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d an almost fairy tale quality. Flashbacks depict a near-future version of the United States, full of people that use cellphones and reference Uber. But that world eventually becomes Gilead, a retrograde and repressive theocratic society in which the title characters wear Amish-like bonnets. The cinematography and the blend of signifiers from different time periods make it all feel somewhat timeless. (Which is part of the point. This could be any moment in time given the history of female oppression.) But there is one color that stands out: blood red. It\u2019s the color of the robes that \u201chandmaids\u201d like Offred (Elisabeth Moss) must wear as a mark of their position in this world. It\u2019s a world in which birthrates have plummeted, so a woman\u2019s fertility is at once a gift and a curse. It saves them from being sent to the oft-mentioned colonies, where they would be forced to clean up toxic waste and live short, painful lives. But it also means they are forced to become handmaids, routinely raped in order to bear heirs for the men in power whose wives are infertile. Offred, like all handmaids, is rarely alone. She travels with her fellow handmaid Ofglen (Alexis Bledel) to pick up food at a grocery store that seems straight out of a 1950s Sears catalog, with chipper music and blindingly white d\u00e9cor. \u201cAunt\u201d Lydia (a chilling Ann Dowd) teaches Offred the responsibilities of her post at the Red Center. Rita (Amanda Brugel), the \u201cMartha\u201d of the household (the domestic help), regards her with little more than wariness. There is no sense of connection between these women. The culture that shapes their lives purposely breeds a sense of distrust among them. Men like Cmdr. Fred Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) appear in the margins, their direct presence felt only during those brutal nights. But his wife, Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski), is always there, treating Offred with open disdain and jealousy. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is best when charting this territory, demonstrating the ways that women become complicit in a patriarchy that ultimately keeps them powerless. Yet, there seems to be some nuance missing. In many ways this premiere aims to cut like a freshly sharpened blade but instead bludgeons like a baseball bat. This episode works best when it relies on sparse dialogue and focuses on Moss\u2019s face. Offred is introduced while comforting her young daughter, Hannah (Jordana Blake), in the back seat of a car as her husband, Luke (O. T. Fagbenle), drives their car away from unseen pursuers. After they\u2019re forced to escape on foot, Luke is killed offscreen, Hannah is taken, and Offred is knocked unconscious. Moss\u2019s performance is equal parts wounded, steely and yearning. It\u2019s superb work, which makes the decision to include heavy-handed voice-over a disappointing one. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s meant to establish Offred\u2019s interiority \u2014 creating a juxtaposition between her biting, sometimes vulgar remarks and her obedient exterior \u2014 but the series thus far feels most potent when mining the horror of this dystopia in the quiet glances between characters. As when Offred walks into the handmaid training facility for the first time and locks eyes with Moira (Samira Wiley), a close friend from college: The memory of Moira becomes an anchor for Offred once she finds herself in the home of Fred and Serena Joy. It\u2019s the hope of reconnecting with Moira and with Hannah that helps Offred survive the loneliness, the rape and the cruelty. Offred\u2019s memories are threaded into the episode in ways that further give the story a dreamlike quality. There\u2019s a touching moment in a flashback when Offred reveals to Moira that she\u2019s pregnant and afraid, given the rise in infertility. But Moira comforts her \u2014 \u201cYou and me, like always.\u201d Offred fiercely holds onto the hope of reconnecting with Moira after they\u2019re separated. But then Janine (Madeline Brewer), a somewhat unhinged handmaid whose right eye was plucked out because of disobedience, gives Offred news that nearly breaks her. Moira tried to escape only to be caught and sent to the colonies. By now she\u2019s likely dead. Just when Offred is coming undone, she finds a surprisingly ally: Ofglen. Over a walk one afternoon, Ofglen slowly opens up about her life before with a wife and son who were both able to escape to Canada. In turn, Offred speaks of Hannah and Luke. \u201cThere\u2019s an Eye in your house,\u201d Ofglen warns when they part ways, referring to a member of the secret police. \u201cBe careful.\u201d But this sudden sign of concern brings with it unease. Is it a coincidence that Ofglen opens up when Offred is at her most vulnerable? Is Ofglen being kind or seeking to make Offred so paranoid that she puts herself in danger? Whether there is an Eye spying in the household is beside the point. Handmaids are always being watched and studied for the mere whiff of radical thought. Offred can\u2019t afford to let fear upend her. As she says to herself in the close of the episode, Offred has to do the one thing Gilead makes nearly impossible: survive, and not let the red cloak she wears define her. Other Gossip: \u2022 One of the most powerful scenes comes when Janine is encircled by other handmaids who insult her as she\u2019s forced to recount a brutal gang rape. This scene isn\u2019t just notable for the brief cameo of Margaret Atwood, who wrote the novel on which the series if based. It\u2019s also notable for the way it introduces a central conflict within Offred: Surviving in order to find her daughter makes her complicit with the same forces that undermine what little hope she still has. \u2022 \u201cThe ceremony\u201d ritual is harrowing. Fred is fully clothed. Offred\u2019s arms are held down by Serena Joy, who keeps her eyes on her husband. Offred\u2019s face is impassive, but at times her fear and disgust briefly breaks through. \u2022 Having Moira played by a black actress brings up a lot of questions about racial dynamics. I\u2019m curious if the show will directly address them. Showrunner Bruce Miller and the cast seem aware of how such a change affects the series.", "title": "\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Series Premiere Recap: Welcome to Gilead", "abstract": "In some ways, this is the story of a fictional, dystopic future.
