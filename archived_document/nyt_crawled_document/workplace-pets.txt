{"text": "On a chilly morning in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown, Mimi and Coco trot off to work at Amy\u2019s Hair Salon: two Maltese dogs in hand-knit sweaters. They are Amy\u2019s dogs. But for no extra charge, they will join the customer in the styling chair. Uptown in the garment district, a costume jewelry firm has six rabbits hopping around its headquarters \u2014 office pets that double as unofficial members of the marketing team. In the cluttered office of a parking garage on Claver Place in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the phone rings. Except it\u2019s not the phone. It\u2019s an African gray parrot named Blacks. He makes small talk at a blue-and-gold macaw named Lola and anyone else in earshot, including the garage\u2019s resident mutt. A lot of animals have jobs in New York City these days: therapy dogs at nursing homes, four-legged explosives detectors nosing your luggage at the airport, cats on mouse patrol at the corner bodega, not to mention holdovers like the carriage horses of Central Park. But there are countless others whose duties are less formal and more about making the workplace a nicer place to hang out. At Amy\u2019s Hair Salon, where a complex procedure like hair straightening can take hours, petting a dog seems to make the time vanish. \u201cThey play with the dog, they pat the dog, so it\u2019s not boring,\u201d the owner, Amy Ooi, said. (The dogs\u2019 white coats also make them perfect hair-dye models, because their fur does not have to be bleached first to make the color show up. Lately, Coco has pink, blue and purple stripes on her ears and Mimi has purple-pink stripes.) One recent Friday afternoon, Michi Yoshimuri, a music therapist, came in for highlights. Ms. Ooi lifted Coco onto Ms. Yoshimuri\u2019s lap. She stroked Coco\u2019s tail contentedly. Coco\u2019s sister Mimi gave a few jealous yips. \u201cYou want Mimi, too?\u201d Ms. Ooi asked. Ms. Yoshimuri did. \u201cThat cute face!\u201d Ms. Yoshimuri cooed. \u201cIt\u2019s healing just to watch them.\u201d Ms. Ooi wrapped Ms. Yoshimuri\u2019s new highlights in foil. Ms. Yoshimuri stroked Mimi\u2019s ear until the little dog fell asleep. Some years ago, the costume jewelry company Sequin invited Vogue editors to its showroom on West 39th Street. The meeting was tense; the editors from Vogue said nothing. \u201cThey were very nice, but they were nonreactive,\u201d said Kim Dryer, an owner of Sequins. \u201cThen the rabbit hopped across the room, and it broke the ice completely. It changed the dynamic of the whole meeting.\u201d The rabbit was huge and black and named Grizzly. The new jewelry line got a nice write-up. Recently, behind display boards hung with earrings and necklaces, a black rabbit named Lucas munched a big kale leaf. Downstairs, four cats lined up by the time clock around quitting time to get their heads scratched by sample makers as they punch out. \u201cThe first question we ask anyone at an interview is, \u2018Are you O.K. with pets?\u2019\u201d Ms. Dryer said. Dr. Carlos J. Huerta started taking his rescue dog, Luna, to his Midtown dental office a couple of days a week so as not to leave her home alone. But she quickly proved adept at soothing anxious patients. \u201cThere\u2019s several people who won\u2019t make an appointment unless they know she\u2019s going to be here,\u201d Dr. Huerta said. One recent Thursday, Kyle Rush sat down in the exam chair and Luna, a 3-year-old spaniel mix, hopped up in his lap. Dr. Huerta reclined the chair and Luna stretched out along Mr. Rush\u2019s legs. \u201cSometimes I get a little bit tense,\u201d Mr. Rush said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice every now and then to pet Luna rather than just get more and more tense.\u201d The drill hit something and changed pitch. Mr. Rush gently dug his fingers into Luna\u2019s haunches. Patients sometimes got nervous, too, at Allied Orthopedics, a prosthetic limb outfitter in Brooklyn. That was where Zeus, a very large African spurred tortoise, came in. \u201cThe patients were entertained because he would walk off with their socks,\u201d said Robert Cohen, the owner. Zeus lived into his 30s and eventually grew to nearly 80 pounds. Sometimes he would hide under the bathroom sink and startle unsuspecting visitors. Allied Orthopedics, now in Ozone Park, Queens, has been without a tortoise for five years. But Mr. Cohen\u2019s daughter is raising a hatchling who may follow Zeus\u2019s footsteps into the family business. \u201cEventually,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cOne day.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/nyregion/workplace-pets.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T12:04:15-04:00", "abstract": "Some office pets are raising the customer-loyalty bar by cuddling and interacting with clients and patients.", "title": "The Dog in the Dentist\u2019s Chair, and Other Workplace Pets", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T12:04:35-04:00"}
