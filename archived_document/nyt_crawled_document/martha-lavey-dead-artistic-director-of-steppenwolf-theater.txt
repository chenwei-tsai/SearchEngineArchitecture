{"text": "Martha Lavey, who took over as artistic director of the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago in 1995 and over the next 20 years made it a showcase for acclaimed productions and an incubator for new plays and young playwrights, died on Tuesday in Chicago. She was 60. The cause was complications of a stroke, her brother Jim said. Ms. Lavey was an actress by training. She appeared in more than 30 productions at Steppenwolf, where she became a member of the ensemble in 1993 and later succeeded Randall Arney as artistic director. It was a period of painful transition. The brilliant talents who established the theater\u2019s reputation in the 1970s \u2014 John Malkovich, Gary Sinise and Laurie Metcalf among them \u2014 had gone on to careers in film and television. Steppenwolf seemed increasingly directionless, riven by internal dissent and tarnished by a series of lackluster productions. Ms. Lavey got off to a flying start. One of the first productions on her watch, a revival of Sam Shepard\u2019s \u201cBuried Child,\u201d later opened on Broadway. Soon after, she lured Mr. Malkovich back to the theater to take the leading role in the Stephen Jeffreys play \u201cThe Libertine.\u201d Looking forward, she commissioned new plays; brought in up-and-coming playwrights like Tracy Letts (\u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d), Tarrell Alvin McCraney (\u201cIn Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,\u201d adapted for the film \u201cMoonlight\u201d) and Bruce Norris (the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cClybourne Park\u201d); and created new workshops and experimental performing spaces. During her tenure, Steppenwolf presented a long list of critically praised productions. Several transferred to Broadway, winning nine Tony Awards. The theater\u2019s restagings of Ken Kesey\u2019s \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d and Edward Albee\u2019s \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d both won Tonys for best revival. Mr. Letts\u2019s \u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d was developed at the theater and had its world premiere there. After moving to Broadway, it won five awards at the 2007 Tonys, including best play. Mr. Letts went on to win a best-actor Tony in 2013 for \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d Steppenwolf\u2019s production of Mr. Letts\u2019s \u201cSuperior Donuts\u201d opened on Broadway in 2009 and was developed into a television series, with Judd Hirsch and Jermaine Fowler, that had its premiere on CBS in February. Martha Ann Lavey (rhymes with navy) was born on Feb. 20, 1957, in Lawrence, Kan., where her father, Robert, was a graduate student at the University of Kansas and was later recruited by the C.I.A. as a Russian specialist. Her mother, the former Patricia Colchin, was a homemaker. When Martha was 11, the family moved to Detroit. She attended Immaculata High School, where, her sights already set on an acting career, she appeared as Annie Sullivan in \u201cThe Miracle Worker.\u201d She studied drama at Northwestern University, graduating with a bachelor of science degree from its School of Communication in 1979. She then enrolled in an acting class taught by Mr. Malkovich, who cast her as a Brazilian Indian in Christopher Hampton\u2019s \u201cSavages\u201d at Steppenwolf, which he was directing. The play is remembered as one of the theater\u2019s most spectacular disasters \u2014 Mr. Malkovich later called it \u201cthe worst production of a play in the history of Chicago theater\u201d \u2014 but Ms. Lavey emerged unscathed. A marriage in the early 1980s ended in divorce. In addition to her brother Jim, Ms. Lavey is survived by her parents; a sister, Michele Dragisity, and four other brothers: Kevin, Matt, John and Patrick. Ms. Lavey returned to Northwestern for a master\u2019s degree, awarded in 1986, and a doctorate in performance studies, awarded in 1994. Frank Galati, one of her teachers, cast her in her breakthrough role, as a fragile recluse in Wallace Shawn\u2019s \u201cAunt Dan and Lemon,\u201d which Mr. Galati directed at Steppenwolf in 1987. \u201cThe exquisitely beautiful Lavey, with her flawless, hypnotic diction and dreamy grace, captures the girl\u2019s ghostly quality \u2014 turning her into a kind of cracked porcelain doll,\u201d the critic Hedy Weiss wrote in The Chicago Sun-Times. Ms. Lavey appeared in productions at other Chicago theaters, most notably at the Goodman, where Mr. Galati directed her in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cA Winter\u2019s Tale\u201d in 1990. \u201cIf there is one performance that dominates the production, it is Ms. Lavey\u2019s tremendously affecting Hermione,\u201d Frank Rich of The New York Times wrote. \u201cTo testify in the trial scene, she rises from her prison through a trapdoor in a gray smock and bare feet, then argues against her husband\u2019s false accusations. \u201cAs she does so,\u201d the review continued, \u201cMs. Lavey stands completely still, her arms dangling at her side, her raven hair streaming down her back, her eyes glassy with grief but never pleading. She offers the simple dignity of a true martyr, not the melodramatic piety of the self-martyred.\u201d Ms. Lavey continued to act after taking over as artistic director, usually appearing in one Steppenwolf production each year. In 2005 she appeared opposite Mr. Malkovich in \u201cLost Land,\u201d by Mr. Jeffreys. Her commitment to new plays and new writing was evident in her sponsorship of Mr. Letts, to whom she gave carte blanche after seeing \u201cKiller Joe,\u201d his first play. Mr. Letts recently told The Chicago Sun-Times: \u201cI went to her with \u2018August: Osage County\u2019 before I had written it \u2014 and told her I have a three-act, three-and-a-half-hour play, with 13 characters in it, and there\u2019s a three-story set \u2014 and she said, \u2018Great! Go write it. We\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d Under Ms. Lavey\u2019s leadership, Steppenwolf doubled the size of its ensemble and opened the Garage Theater, whose annual Garage Rep series presents works by small local companies. Ike Holter\u2019s play about the Stonewall uprising, \u201cHit the Wall,\u201d which opened at the Barrow Theater in Manhattan in 2013, came out of the Garage Rep program. Ms. Lavey also created an experimental series for the Studio Theater, a former rehearsal hall that she turned into a permanent theater, Steppenwolf Upstairs. And she created Steppenwolf for Young Adults, a series serving the public schools with plays aimed at teenagers; the School at Steppenwolf, which offers training residencies; and First Look Repertory of New Work, a program presenting new plays in development. Ms. Lavey stepped down as artistic director in 2015, shortly after two of her productions, Lisa D\u2019Amour\u2019s \u201cAirline Highway\u201d and Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s \u201cThis Is Our Youth\u201d made the leap to Broadway. She was succeeded by Anna D. Shapiro, the Tony-winning director of \u201cAugust: Osage County.\u201d Ms. Shapiro had been hired to run the New Plays Lab, a workshop for developing new writers and works, in 1995, the same year Mr. Lavey became artistic director.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/theater/martha-lavey-dead-artistic-director-of-steppenwolf-theater.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T19:54:35-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "created_date": "2017-04-27T19:54:35-04:00", "abstract": "An actress by training, Ms. Lavey was artistic director of Steppenwolf Theater during a period of great expansion.", "title": "Martha Lavey, a Leading Lady of Chicago Theater, Dies at 60"}
