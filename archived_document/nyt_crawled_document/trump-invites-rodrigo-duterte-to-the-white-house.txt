{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Saturday invited the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to the White House, embracing an authoritarian leader who is accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug dealers and crudely disparaging Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. Mr. Trump had a \u201cvery friendly conversation with Mr. Duterte,\u201d according to a statement issued by the White House late Saturday. It said that the two leaders \u201cdiscussed the fact that the Philippines is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs.\u201d In fact, Mr. Duterte\u2019s war on drugs has resulted in the deaths of several thousand suspected drug dealers, bringing condemnation from human rights groups and many Western governments. A spokesman for Mr. Duterte, Ernesto Abella, confirmed the White House invitation, saying that Mr. Trump had expressed \u201chis understanding and appreciation of the challenges facing the Philippine president, especially on the matter\u201d of drugs. Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of the Philippine leader comes a week after Mr. Trump called to congratulate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for his victory in a disputed referendum that cemented his autocratic rule. He has also lavishly praised President Xi Jinping of China in recent days for his cooperation in pressuring North Korea, overlooking the fact that Mr. Xi, too, has shown an increasingly repressive streak in his country. Mr. Trump has spoken warmly of the Egyptian leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who seized power in a military coup. And he vowed during the presidential campaign to reset relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. An outspoken populist with a shoot-from-the-hip style, Mr. Duterte shares some characteristics with Mr. Trump. That was not the case with Mr. Obama, whom Mr. Duterte called a \u201cson of a whore\u201d when he was asked how he would react if Mr. Obama raised human rights issues with him. He later apologized, and his aides said his comment was an expression of frustration rather than a personal attack against the American president. In its statement, the White House suggested that Mr. Trump was eager to mend relations. The president\u2019s invitation, it said, was aimed at discussing \u201cthe importance of the United States-Philippine alliance, which is now headed in a very positive direction.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/politics/trump-invites-rodrigo-duterte-to-the-white-house.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T00:44:23-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T00:41:18-04:00", "abstract": "The two leaders spoke late on Saturday and addressed the Philippines\u2019 violent campaign against drugs, which has been condemned by human rights groups and many Western governments.", "title": "Trump Invites Rodrigo Duterte to the White House"}
