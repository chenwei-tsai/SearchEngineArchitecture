{"text": "INTERNATIONAL An Interpreter article on Tuesday about how the colonial war in Algeria that ended in 1962 continues to influence French politics referred incorrectly to a law that mandated teaching the benefits of French colonialism in schools. The law, enacted in 2005, was repealed in 2006; it is not still in effect. \u2022 An article on Tuesday about calls by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela to rewrite his country\u2019s Constitution misstated the timing of a Supreme Court decision to strip power from the National Assembly. It was handed down in March, not April. \u2022 An article on April 25 about a United Nations commission investigating possible war crimes in Syria misstated the number of witnesses and victims it has interviewed. The number is now more than 5,200, not more than 1,400. BUSINESS DAY An article on Friday about President Trump\u2019s plan to end the federal deduction for state and local taxes misstated a reason some taxpayers can deduct sales taxes from their federal returns. In Nevada and Washington, it is because the states have no state income taxes, not \u201clow\u201d income taxes. SPORTS An article on Saturday about Theo Epstein\u2019s return to Boston after winning a World Series with the Chicago Cubs misidentified the highway he crossed on his walk to Fenway Park on Friday. It is I-90, not I-95. \u2022 Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about soccer clubs changing their logos misstated the year the Liverpool Football Club was founded. As an accompanying picture correctly showed, it was 1892, not 1872. OBITUARIES Because of an editing error, an obituary on Tuesday about the American diplomat Malcolm Toon referred incorrectly to the fate of SALT II, an arms agreement with the Soviet Union that Mr. Toon took part in negotiating. President Jimmy Carter withdrew it from Senate consideration; it was not the case that \u201cthe Senate voted not to ratify it.\u201d Because of another editing error, the obituary misstated the distance between Boston and Northborough, Mass., where Mr. Toon grew up. It is about 35 miles, not about 50. The Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.
