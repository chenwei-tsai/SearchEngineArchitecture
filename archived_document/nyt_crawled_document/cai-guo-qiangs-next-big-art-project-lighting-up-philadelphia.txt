{"abstract": "\u201cCai Guo-Qiang: Fireflies,\u201d which will decorate the city\u2019s Benjamin Franklin Parkway with hundreds of colorful lanterns, opens on Sept. 14.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "Benjamin Franklin Parkway, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Philadelphia and the nexus of that city\u2019s great museums, turns 100 this year. To celebrate, this fall the artist Cai Guo-Qiang will turn the boulevard into a nocturnal dreamscape with one of his largest public artworks in the United States. \u201cCai Guo-Qiang: Fireflies,\u201d commissioned by the Association for Public Art with Fung Collaboratives (led by the curator Lance Fung), is scheduled to open on Sept. 14 with a choreographed light and movement performance, and will remain on view through Oct. 8. Mr. Cai\u2019s ephemeral art is often made with fireworks and gunpowder \u2014 as was the case with his contribution to the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and in the 2012 work \u201cSky Ladder,\u201d in his hometown, Quanzhou, China. For \u201cFireflies,\u201d he has created a fleet of customized pedicabs \u2014 described as \u201cpart rickshaw and part kinetic sculpture\u201d \u2014 to carry hundreds of colorful paper lanterns that will bob up and down the boulevard. During the opening performance, the roughly 900 Chinese-inspired lanterns will create aerial drawings in the night sky. On subsequent evenings, the lights will be more improvisational as the pedicabs are open for public use along the parkway, which has the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Robert Indiana\u2019s \u201cLOVE\u201d sculpture as its bookends and is lined with flags from around the world. \u201cI am very pleased that people from different walks of life will participate,\u201d Mr. Cai, who is now based in New York, said in a statement. \u201cPerhaps the many colors and shapes of the glowing lanterns will remind viewers of the multiplicity of people who come from around the world to root in the United States.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/arts/design/cai-guo-qiangs-next-big-art-project-lighting-up-philadelphia.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T15:12:53-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Cai Guo-Qiang\u2019s Next Big Art Project: Lighting Up Philadelphia", "created_date": "2017-04-18T15:12:53-04:00", "section": "Arts"}
