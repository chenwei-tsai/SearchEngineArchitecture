Second Stage Theater, an important Off Broadway company in New York, and the Center Theater Group, a vibrant and large regional organization in Los Angeles, said on Thursday that they will commission a series of new plays by American writers with the aim of producing the works first at the California theater and then on Broadway. The theater companies have chosen six prominent writers to inaugurate their collaboration: the Pulitzer winners Lynn Nottage (\u201cSweat\u201d) and Paula Vogel (\u201cIndecent\u201d); the Tony winner Lisa Kron (\u201cFun Home\u201d); as well as Jon Robin Baitz (\u201cOther Desert Cities\u201d), Will Eno (\u201cThe Realistic Joneses\u201d) and Young Jean Lee (\u201cStraight White Men\u201d). The Broadway productions will be at the Helen Hayes Theater, which, with 585 seats, is the smallest on Broadway, and which has recently been purchased by Second Stage, which is now renovating it and planning to reopen it next Spring. The Helen Hayes \u2014 which could be renamed for a donor \u2014 is the sixth of 41 Broadway theaters now controlled by a nonprofit organization. \u201cI want to be at the forefront of bringing to Broadway a new audience and stories that haven\u2019t been told,\u201d said Carole Rothman, the artistic director of Second Stage. Michael Ritchie, the artistic director of the Los Angeles theater, which has sent 50 shows to Broadway over the years, said that the new collaboration would benefit Los Angeles theatergoers, as well as playwrights. \u201cI will get a wider variety and a greater quality and quantity of good plays for my audience,\u201d Mr. Ritchie said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s good for the playwrights in terms of financial recognition and a partnership that could and should lead to Broadway productions.\u201d While Broadway is flush with big musicals and British imports, many aimed at an audience of tourists, contemporary plays by American writers are harder to come by there. Before the commissions are ready for production, Second Stage will open its Broadway theater next spring with a production of \u201cLobby Hero,\u201d written by Kenneth Lonergan, directed by Trip Cullman, and starring Chris Evans (\u201cCaptain America\u201d), in his Broadway debut, along with Michael Cera (\u201cArrested Development\u201d). Mr. Cera\u2019s  Broadway debut came in 2014 in a revival of Mr. Lonergan\u2019s \u201cThis Is Our Youth.\u201d \u201cLobby Hero\u201d will be followed by Ms. Lee\u2019s \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d directed by Anna Shapiro. Second Stage also announced Thursday that it would present a production of \u201cMary Page Marlowe,\u201d by Tracy Letts, in its existing Off Broadway theater next season.", "item_type": "Article"}
