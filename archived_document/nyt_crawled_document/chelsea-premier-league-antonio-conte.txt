{"text": "LIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Chelsea\u2019s fans had been working their way through the champion-in-waiting\u2019s songbook for about half an hour, ever since the first goal went in. They touched on all the old, traditional standards \u2014 \u201cNow You\u2019re Going To Believe Us,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re Top Of The League\u201d and so on \u2014 and gave air to more recent releases, like \u201cTottenham Hotspur, We\u2019re Waiting For You,\u201d too. With every recital, the volume grew louder; with every added goal, too. By the time the final whistle went, and Chelsea\u2019s 3-0 victory against Everton was confirmed, it sounded as if they had reached the top of their range. Not quite. Chelsea\u2019s players headed to the Bullens Road Paddock \u2014 the corner of this atmospheric old stadium where the traveling fans are corralled \u2014 as soon as the match was finished. After exchanging pleasantries with Everton\u2019s coaching staff, Antonio Conte, the Chelsea manager, walked over to join his team. Conte is an accomplished rabble-rouser, and evidently things were not sufficiently boisterous for him. When he arrived on the touchline, he raised his arms and pumped his fists, and then jumped on the back of his tallest player, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. The fans roared their approval, and the decibel level steadily rose, the songs of defiance and delight echoing around Goodison Park, empty apart from that one euphoric corner. Chelsea will be champion, Conte knows that; this was, by some distance, the most exacting test left to the club, and it was passed with comparative ease. Chelsea now remains four points ahead of its nearest challenger, after Tottenham defeated Arsenal in their London derby a couple of hours after Conte\u2019s celebration in Liverpool. There are four games left. Three of Chelsea\u2019s are at home, against some of the Premier League\u2019s lesser lights. Convention dictates that Conte talk about \u201ctaking it game by game,\u201d demanding that his players should not get ahead of themselves, but these are just platitudes now. Perhaps if the situation were reversed \u2014 if Tottenham was leading Chelsea \u2014 it would be different. Maybe if Liverpool or Manchester City or Arsenal were sitting at the summit then there would still be room for doubt. All of those teams, after all, are cast in the modern Premier League mold. At their best, they are vibrant, exciting, brash. They are all capable of playing more thrilling soccer than Chelsea, built to be efficient and effective and only rarely beautiful. But they are also more fragile, more flawed, more prone to error, more susceptible to pressure. They might melt in the heat of a title race, even a heavily handicapped one. Chelsea is cut from rather different cloth. Given that Conte\u2019s team has now led the Premier League for 20 games \u2014 it went top of the table on December 11, and has not offered so much as a chink of light since \u2014 and has looked unassailable for months, it is curious that so much of the praise it has received has, on the surface, been so qualified. \u201cThe main thing you notice about Chelsea this season is that they are very fit,\u201d said Slaven Bilic, the West Ham United manager. \u201cThey work hard, they are very solid and on top of that, they have that quality up front which is basically making the difference in every game. If you compare them with the other title contenders, Chelsea is more solid than Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool.\u201d It was not exactly a paean to greatness, and it was far from unique. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s suggestion that Chelsea is just an \u201camazing defensive team\u201d can probably be discounted as partisan politics; Pep Guardiola\u2019s assertion that it is only efficiency in \u201cboth boxes\u201d that has separated Chelsea from its rivals should be treated with similar caution. But there are others \u2014 far less self-interested observers \u2014 who have made the same point. Claude Puel of Southampton described Chelsea as playing with a \u201cstrong defense and counterattack.\u201d Bournemouth\u2019s Eddie Howe talks about Chelsea \u201cdoing very well, with the system they play.\u201d Burnley\u2019s Sean Dyche fixated on Conte\u2019s players\u2019 fitness, too. Everton\u2019s Ronald Koeman, in defeat here Sunday, suggested Chelsea did not need to play \u201cto a high football level to know they will win a game.\u201d \u201cIt is a difficult system to play against,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are really experienced, they know how to wait, and then they are really clinical. They do not need many chances.\u201d It all sounds, somehow, damningly faint: fixating on how much farther they run, or how well-drilled they are, as if it is somehow cheating, when other, more exciting, more gifted teams would be more romantic or more deserving champions. And yet, in that asterisked praise \u2014 Chelsea, the *best team in England (but not the most talented) \u2014 is the reason that it is Conte\u2019s team preparing for a parade and not all of the others. The Premier League fetishizes entertainment, an entertainment that depends on a degree of imperfection. It is teams with easily-exposed and easily-exploited flaws, teams that can touch the sky one minute and plumb the depths the next, that provide compelling viewing. Chelsea, under Conte, has not bought into any of that. It is ruthless and it is clinical and it is all of those things its reluctant admirers mention, and that is why it will be the champion. It does not see entertainment as a virtue. Entertainment is a byproduct, or it is a weakness. Winning: now there\u2019s a virtue. Sunday was a case in point. Chelsea was not spectacular \u2014 though its first and third goals showcased the talent Conte has at his disposal \u2014 but it did not panic. It was calm, and patient, two qualities sadly lacking in the saloon brawl atmosphere of English soccer, and it found its reward. After he had left the field, his heart still pulsing, Conte mentioned his autobiography in his first post-match interview. Its title is \u201cHead, Heart and Legs.\u201d They are the three qualities he wants his team to embody. Preferably in that order. That\u2019s the order that wins you titles.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/sports/soccer/chelsea-premier-league-antonio-conte.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T13:26:09-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T13:26:09-04:00", "abstract": "Chelsea under Antonio Conte is ruthless and it is clinical and that is why it will be the Premier League champion.", "title": "Chelsea Cruises, and It\u2019s All Over but the Critiquing"}
