{"abstract": "Since taking over two years ago, James and Lachlan Murdoch seem determined to rid the company of the old-guard culture on which their father built his empire.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "The sun was setting in New York as James Murdoch, looking confident in cream pants and a dark blazer, stepped before 350 guests in a glass-walled concert hall and waxed poetic about his pet TV channel and its dedication to \u201cscientific literacy.\u201d The event on Wednesday night was an advertising showcase for National Geographic, which Mr. Murdoch, 44, has doted on since becoming chief executive of its parent company, 21st Century Fox. As a person who cares deeply about \u201cissues related to the environment, conservation, exploration and education,\u201d he told the crowd, \u201cI\u2019m personally grateful for the important work National Geographic does.\u201d Across town at that same moment, his 86-year-old father, Rupert \u2014 who once called climate change \u201calarmist nonsense\u201d \u2014 was still dealing with fallout at his most cherished channel, Fox News. Bill O\u2019Reilly, the pugnacious and top-rated talk show host, had been ousted that day after allegations of sexual harassment involving multiple women. It was James Murdoch \u2014 the one looking so unperturbed at the NatGeo presentation, posing for photos as waiters milled about in yellow suspenders and guests ate skirt steak and shrimp cocktail \u2014 who had most aggressively moved against Mr. O\u2019Reilly. The same had happened in July, when Roger Ailes, who founded Fox News with Rupert Murdoch, was forced to resign amid his own sexual harassment scandal. This is what generational change at one of the globe\u2019s most powerful media conglomerates looks like. With James and his elder brother, Lachlan, 45, who is the executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, firmly entrenched as their father\u2019s successors, they are now forcibly exerting themselves. Their father remains very involved, but his sons seem determined to rid the company of its roguish, old-guard internal culture and tilt operations toward the digital future. They are working to make the family empire their own, not the one the elder Murdoch created to suit his sensibilities. \u201cThey are both young enough to see and understand that the company has to change,\u201d said Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company. \u201cAt some media companies, there is a feeling that people are being dragged kicking and screaming into the digital future. I don\u2019t get that sense with the brothers at all.\u201d Fox executives either did not return calls or declined to comment for this article. But a picture of a new Murdoch era emerged in interviews with more than a dozen people who work at the company or are friendly with James and Lachlan, most of whom spoke anonymously for fear of reprisals. Over his storied career, Rupert Murdoch repeatedly showed that he was willing to trade workplace culture for profits \u2014 ride people hard, overlook putrid behavior as long as the results are there, reward infighting. When his sons took over two years ago, however, they immediately set about creating a warmer and fuzzier workplace, at least in parts of the company, and moving away from an anti-politically correct environment that, at least in the case of Fox News, seemed to enable the kind of behavior of which Mr. Ailes and Mr. O\u2019Reilly have been accused. Both men deny the allegations. Employees at the Fox broadcast network said they were pleasantly surprised, for instance, to be summoned to a town-hall meeting \u2014 something that had rarely if ever been done under the archly conservative Rupert Murdoch \u2014 where the brothers espoused transparency, workplace diversity and greater cooperation between divisions. In the fall, James and Lachlan introduced additional benefits, including more paid vacation, vastly enhanced reproductive coverage for women and \u201cexpanded coverage for our transgender colleagues.\u201d The brothers concluded the memo on a jaunty note: \u201cEnjoy!\u201d James and Lachlan overhauled their international networks business, a collection of some 350 channels; changed leadership at their film studio, home to the \u201cX-Men\u201d movies; and poured money into National Geographic. They culled the company\u2019s entertainment ranks of roughly 400 employees, something James described at the time as a \u201cventilation.\u201d (While some people in Hollywood saw the move as ageist, grumbling was minimal; Fox offered relatively lavish buyout packages.) The brothers have even shaken up 21st Century Fox\u2019s profile in Washington, replacing their father\u2019s Republican lobbying chief with a Democratic one. One Hollywood friend equated their mind-set to moving into an outdated house and looking for wood rot. Still, some of the most dramatic changes at 21st Century Fox over the last two years, including the ouster of Mr. O\u2019Reilly, have been forced on them. When they first took over, they stepped gingerly around Fox News. James and his progressive-minded wife, Kathryn, have long been embarrassed by certain elements of Fox News, associates said, while Lachlan\u2019s views of the network have been more in line with his father\u2019s. Both sons were willing to tolerate the freewheeling Fox News culture because of the enormous profit the channel generates. Analysts estimate that the division generated 25 percent of 21st Century Fox\u2019s operating income last year, which was $6.6 billion. Only last summer, when the former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment suit against Mr. Ailes, did James and Lachlan, and eventually Rupert, force change. And even then the overhaul at Fox News was limited; control was given to longtime Ailes lieutenants, and the company continued to support Mr. O\u2019Reilly in the face of repeated allegations of sexual harassment, even giving him a contract extension. It was not until The New York Times disclosed financial settlements, which involved multiple women who alleged that Mr. O\u2019Reilly had behaved inappropriately, and advertisers began leaving his show in droves, that the company forced him out. Maintaining a culture based on \u201ctrust and respect,\u201d as 21st Century Fox promised when Mr. Ailes left, was easier said than done. As James and Lachlan move to modernize their company, several questions have emerged. The biggest: Can you truly change the culture without losing what made it so successful? It was Rupert\u2019s band-of-pirates mentality that willed the Fox broadcast network into existence, and turned Fox News into a source of astounding profit and political muscle. Rupert Murdoch spent decades plotting and re-plotting which of his children would take over his empire. In 1997, Lachlan became the crown prince. When Lachlan quit in 2005 after sparring with Mr. Ailes, James ascended. But James was seen as  badly mishandling the phone-hacking scandal at family-owned tabloids in Britain. For a time there was speculation that Rupert\u2019s daughter Elisabeth, who founded the Shine reality TV juggernaut, had a shot. The brothers eventually rose back to the top. Yet they have not entirely convinced Wall Street analysts that their pairing is workable in the long term. Some people do not see James and Lachlan as equals. \u201cJames has a lot of experience in senior management, and he is capable of running a business,\u201d said Mr. Creutz, the analyst. \u201cLachlan? I don\u2019t know. People don\u2019t know him as well. He is looked at a bit more skeptically by investors.\u201d Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, challenged that notion. \u201cAs a manager, Lachlan has grown and developed quite a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the brothers get along well, and that Lachlan\u2019s views are falling into line with James\u2019s.\u201d The brothers are radically different in style. James is a speed-talking, tightly wound technophile \u2014 cool and calculating, to the degree that he can come across as slick, several associates said. Fashion forward, James socializes with young technology kingpins like Elon Musk, a founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Lachlan, with his tattooed forearm, avoids the spotlight, rarely popping up in Hollywood watering holes like Tower Bar, where James has a signature table. Lachlan comes across as a more grounded guy\u2019s guy. On his first day as executive chairman, he rolled onto the Fox lot in Los Angeles in a pickup truck. Friends say the brothers don\u2019t spar with each other, or they at least keep any disagreements hidden, but they don\u2019t seem to have much of an affinity for each other, either. Lachlan lives in the fashionable Mandeville Canyon area of Los Angeles with his wife, Sarah, a former model, and their three children. James\u2019s family uses New York as home base. (James and Kathryn Murdoch \u2014 whose Twitter feed shows disdain for President Trump \u2014 are also building what has been called a survivalist compound in rural Canada that has its own water and energy supply.) James, the youngest of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s four adult children, has always been seen as bright and willful. He was an earring-wearing rebel in his younger days, dropping out of Harvard in 1995 to found a hip-hop record label, Rawkus Records. But once in the corporate fold \u2014 Rupert bought the rap company \u2014 James made a rapid ascent. At 24, he was put in charge of digital publishing in the United States. At 27, he was sent to Hong Kong to run a television service, Star, which was ailing at the time. (He turned it around, in part by expanding into India.) Three years later, James was installed as chief executive of another family business, British Sky Broadcasting. (Subscriptions soared.) It was at Sky that James pushed through an initiative to make his part of the Murdoch empire carbon neutral. \u201cA lot of people are worried about climate change but are waiting for someone else to do something about it,\u201d he said in a 2006 news release. \u201cWe are showing that you can take action.\u201d He framed it as good business \u2014 to make employees feel good and to win customers by showing that the company\u2019s values were in tune with the times. Kathryn Murdoch has been seen as driving his interest in environmentalism. She worked for the Clinton Climate Initiative and is a trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund. But then came the British phone-hacking scandal, which shut down the family\u2019s News of the World tabloid in 2011. James was never found to have had direct knowledge of the hacking by members of the paper\u2019s staff. But a parliamentary committee investigating the scandal accused him of \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d after he acknowledged that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims. Lachlan was raised in the United States, graduating from Princeton in 1994. He then spent six years working at his father\u2019s Australian businesses, doing so well that Rupert anointed him \u201cfirst among equals,\u201d which was interpreted as meaning that Lachlan led the succession brigade. (At the time, Rupert also spoke lovingly of Lachlan\u2019s interest in the family news businesses, noting that his son, even as a teenager, would tinker with greasy printing presses.) Lachlan rose to become his father\u2019s deputy chief operating officer and publisher of The New York Post. But he resigned abruptly in July 2005. Lachlan said publicly that he wanted to spend more time in Australia, but most Murdochologists chalked up his departure to friction with his father. Rupert, a workaholic, sided with Mr. Ailes in a turf war and was also annoyed that his eldest son enjoyed lengthy sailing and mountain climbing vacations. Working together will be crucial if 21st Century Fox is going to navigate the shoals ahead. The conglomerate, like its competitors, is facing an extremely uncertain future. Consumers are canceling or forgoing cable hookups and instead subscribing to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, which 21st Century Fox co-owns. The movie business continues to grapple with piracy, rising costs and flat domestic attendance. Fox also has special problems: With competitors getting bigger \u2014 AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner being Exhibit A \u2014 where does that leave the Murdochs? \u201cThat\u2019s a question I think they asked themselves and moved them to try to buy the rest of Sky,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, referring to a pending $14.3 billion deal for 21st Century Fox to take full control of the British satellite TV giant. At the moment, 21st Century Fox\u2019s portfolio is relatively healthy. Fox News has continued to dominate in the ratings. The FX cable channel has found a steady stream of hits, including \u201cAtlanta\u201d and \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson.\u201d The Fox broadcast network has struggled to find new must-see shows, but the company\u2019s overseas channels and sports networks are thriving. In its most recent quarter, 21st Century Fox reported income of $856 million, a 27 percent increase from the same period a year earlier. Speaking of those results during a call with analysts in February, Lachlan noted moves the company had made to strengthen its business. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying this for a while,\u201d he said, \u201cbut actions and outcomes speak louder than words.\u201d", "section": "Business Day", "title": "In House of Murdoch, Sons Set About an Elaborate Overhaul", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/business/media/murdoch-family-21st-century-fox.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T10:57:44-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T10:57:44-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
