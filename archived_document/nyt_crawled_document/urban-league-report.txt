{"text": "CHICAGO \u2014 Progress made by black Americans in recent years is threatened by President Trump and his policies, the National Urban League said in a report released Tuesday. The Urban League\u2019s annual review found persistent racial gaps, but also notable headway toward equality, during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. The report warned that proposals to reduce education funding and limit federal oversight of local police departments could reverse those gains under Mr. Trump. \u201cIt would be difficult to pinpoint any moment in recent history where so much economic and social progress stood at such dire risk as it does today,\u201d said Marc H. Morial, the civil rights group\u2019s president. African-Americans and Hispanics continue to lag behind their white counterparts in employment, income and education. There were measurable gains, however, under Mr. Obama, when the black unemployment rate fell and more African-Americans graduated from high school. The Urban League calculates an \u201cequality index\u201d that weighs economic factors, health, education, social justice and civic engagement to compare African-Americans to whites. The group found that whites outgained blacks in all of those categories except social engagement, and assigned an overall equality rating of 72.3 percent, meaning that black people \u201care missing about 28 percent of the pie.\u201d That figure is almost exactly in line with last year\u2019s rating. The index for Hispanics compared to whites this year was 78.4 percent. While the Urban League was generally complimentary of Mr. Obama, it said that \u201cthe Obama years were no panacea for America\u2019s longstanding racial inequities.\u201d Civil rights advocates have praised Mr. Obama for expanding health care and increasing financial aid for colleges, but his tenure was also marked by increased rates of gun violence in many cities and several instances of unrest after police officers killed black men. The racial disparities vary widely from city to city. In the Milwaukee area, which the report called the nation\u2019s \u201cleast equal metro area,\u201d the unemployment rate among blacks was 13.8 percent, compared with 2.7 percent among whites. But around Omaha, the gap was much smaller, with 4.9 percent unemployment for blacks and 2.7 percent for whites. In parts of the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis and Toledo, Ohio, the report found that white households on average earned more than twice as much as black households. Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson of Toledo, a Democrat, said in an interview that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed cuts to federal urban development and education programs could be especially harmful to manufacturing cities like hers, which are seeking to reduce poverty and adapt to the changing economy. \u201cHis policies, as stated,\u201d Ms. Hicks-Hudson said, \u201care not designed for minorities, for black people, for urban citizens.\u201d Mr. Trump has taken repeated interest in urban issues, especially violence, and on the campaign trail released a \u201cNew Deal for Black America\u201d that called for cracking down on crime and improving education through school choice. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has expressed skepticism about consent decrees between the Justice Department and local police agencies found to have engaged in a pattern of discriminatory practices. In its report, the Urban League called the Trump administration\u2019s stance on consent decrees \u201ca retreat on common-sense police reform.\u201d The consent decree question has been especially fraught here in Chicago, a city dealing with parallel crises of a high murder rate and a police force that is mistrusted in some of the most violent neighborhoods. Shortly before Mr. Obama left office, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago said he intended to work toward a consent decree, though one has not materialized during the Trump administration. Mr. Trump has weighed in frequently on Chicago\u2019s violence, threatening to \u201csend in the Feds!\u201d if local officials do not solve the problem. Shari Runner, the president and chief executive of the Chicago Urban League, said she saw such talk by Mr. Trump as a barrier to improving the Chicago Police Department and addressing some of the city\u2019s other longstanding problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a talking point,\u201d Ms. Runner said, \u201cand I think there\u2019s very little knowledge or insight into what\u2019s happening in Chicago.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/us/urban-league-report.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T14:59:14-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T14:59:14-04:00", "abstract": "The National Urban League warned that policy changes planned by the Trump administration could reverse gains made by black Americans.", "title": "Key Takeaways From a Report on Racial Gaps"}
