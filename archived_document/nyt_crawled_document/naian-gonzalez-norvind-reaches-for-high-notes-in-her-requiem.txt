{"text": "Lately, the Faur\u00e9 Requiem has weighed heavily on Naian Gonz\u00e1lez Norvind\u2019s mind. So have the requiems of Mozart, Dvorak and Verdi. It\u2019s an immersion course for the role of Caitlin, a 17-year-old violinist who has taken off her senior year, with her parents\u2019 blessing, to compose a death Mass of her own in Greg Pierce\u2019s \u201cHer Requiem,\u201d opening Feb. 22 at the Claire Tow Theater at Lincoln Center. \u201cI try to not only listen to requiems at my leisure, sort of indolently, but to make sense out of them, which is extremely difficult,\u201d she said over lunch at a Chelsea tapas restaurant. \u201cAnd, just for the pleasure of it, to discover these new pieces of music and maybe one you like so much that it will follow you for the rest of your life.\u201d At 24, Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez Norvind \u2014 a daughter of the Mexican actress Nailea Norvind and granddaughter of Eva Norvind, a Norwegian-born New York actress, filmmaker and dominatrix \u2014 has plenty of life ahead. \u201cWhen she died, I hadn\u2019t made the choice to be an actress yet,\u201d she recalled of her grandmother\u2019s encouragement during a visit at 13 to meet Carolyn Anthony, now her manager. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my grandmother had this secret plan to at least open that door for me. But now that I\u2019m here, I sometimes feel like I\u2019m being guided by her.\u201d Diminutive, with heartbreak eyes and pillowy lips that can evoke tomboy or temptress, Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez Norvind took her time returning to the city, earning a degree in modern literature and cinema from the Sorbonne and studying Shakespeare at the London Academy of Music & Dramatic Art \u2014 \u201csomething to speak for myself,\u201d she said. During breaks, she squeezed in television and film roles in Mexico City, including Ra\u00fal Fuentes\u2019s \u201cEverybody\u2019s Got Somebody \u2026 Not Me,\u201d a lesbian love story for which she won the best actress award at the Guanajuato International Film Festival. Last March she traveled to Massachusetts to shoot the pilot of \u201cThe Devil You Know,\u201d Jenji Kohan and Gus Van Sant\u2019s variation on the Salem witch trials, for HBO. When it wasn\u2019t picked up, she \u2014 at last \u2014 immigrated to Greenpoint, Brooklyn, landing a guest spot on CBS\u2019s \u201cBlue Bloods\u201d and a part in a Sam Shepard one-act. Stepping onstage at Lincoln Center so soon after arriving in her adopted city is a rush \u2014 one part dizzying delight, the other stomach-turning terror \u2014 she can\u2019t resist. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine ending my life here, but it\u2019s a little addictive, isn\u2019t it?,\u201d she said, pulling her coat tight before heading into the wintry chill. \u201cI need to give New York as much as it\u2019s asking of me.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/theater/naian-gonzalez-norvind-reaches-for-high-notes-in-her-requiem.html", "published_date": "2016-02-16T19:00:00-05:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T06:00:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T06:00:05-04:00", "abstract": "The actress will play a 17-year-old violinist in the play by Greg Pierce.", "title": "Naian Gonz\u00e1lez Norvind Reaches for High Notes in \u2018Her Requiem\u2019"}
