{"text": "Fans of old TV series may remember a classic \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d episode titled \u201cIt\u2019s a Good Life.\u201d It featured a small town terrorized by a 6-year-old who for some reason had monstrous superpowers, coupled with complete emotional immaturity. Everyone lived in constant fear, made worse by the need to pretend that everything was fine. After all, any hint of discontent could bring terrible retribution. And now you know what it must be like working in the Trump administration. Actually, it feels a bit like that just living in Trump\u2019s America. What set me off on this chain of association? The answer may surprise you; it was the tax \u201cplan\u201d the administration released on Wednesday. The reason I use scare quotes here is that the single-page document the White House circulated this week bore no resemblance to what people normally mean when they talk about a tax plan. True, a few tax rates were mentioned \u2014 but nothing was said about the income thresholds at which these rates apply. Meanwhile, the document said something about eliminating tax breaks, but didn\u2019t say which. For example, would the tax exemption for 401(k) retirement accounts be preserved? The answer, according to the White House, was yes, or maybe no, or then again yes, depending on whom you asked and when you asked. So if you were looking for a document that you could use to estimate, even roughly, how much a given individual would end up paying, sorry. It\u2019s clear, the White House is proposing huge tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, with the breaks especially big for people who can bypass regular personal taxes by channeling their income into tax-privileged businesses \u2014 people, for example, named Donald Trump. So Trump plans to blow up the deficit bigly, largely to his own personal benefit; but that\u2019s about all we know. So why would the White House release such an embarrassing document? Why would the Treasury Department go along with this clown show? Unfortunately, we know the answer. Every report from inside the White House conveys the impression that Trump is like a temperamental child, bored by details and easily frustrated when things don\u2019t go his way; being an effective staffer seems to involve finding ways to make him feel good and take his mind off news that he feels makes him look bad. If he says he wants something, no matter how ridiculous, you say, \u201cYes, Mr. President!\u201d; at most, you try to minimize the damage. Right now, by all accounts, the child-man in chief is in a snit over the prospect of news stories that review his first 100 days and conclude that he hasn\u2019t achieved much if anything (because he hasn\u2019t). So last week he announced the imminent release of something he could call a tax plan. According to The Times, this left Treasury staff \u2014 who were nowhere near having a plan ready to go \u2014 \u201cspeechless.\u201d But nobody dared tell him it couldn\u2019t be done. Instead, they released \u2026 something, with nobody sure what it means. And the absence of a real tax plan isn\u2019t the only thing the inner circle apparently doesn\u2019t dare tell him. Obviously, nobody has yet dared to tell Trump that he did something both ludicrous and vile by accusing President Barack Obama of wiretapping his campaign; instead, administration officials spent weeks trying to come up with something, anything, that would lend substance to the charge. Or consider health care. The attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed ignominiously, for very good reasons: After all that huffing and puffing, Republicans couldn\u2019t come up with a better idea. On the contrary, all their proposals would lead to mass loss of coverage and soaring costs for the most vulnerable. Clearly, Trump and company should just let it go and move on to something else. But that would require a certain level of maturity \u2014 which is a quality nowhere to be found in this White House. So they just keep at it, with proposals everyone I know call zombie Trumpcare 2.0, 3.0, and so on. And I don\u2019t even want to think about foreign policy. On the domestic front, soothing the president\u2019s fragile ego with forceful-sounding but incoherent proclamations can do only so much damage; on the international front it\u2019s a good way to stumble into a diplomatic crisis, or even a war. In any case, I\u2019d like to make a plea to my colleagues in the news media: Don\u2019t pretend that this is normal. Let\u2019s not act as if that thing released on Wednesday, whatever it was, was something like, say, the 2001 Bush tax cut; I strongly disapproved of that cut, but at least it was comprehensible. Let\u2019s not pretend that we\u2019re having a real discussion of, say, the growth effects of changes in business tax rates. No, what we\u2019re looking at here isn\u2019t policy; it\u2019s pieces of paper whose goal is to soothe the big man\u2019s temper tantrums. Unfortunately, we may all pay the price of his therapy.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/living-in-the-trump-zone.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T03:21:23-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-04-28T03:21:23-04:00", "abstract": "We\u2019re in a place and time where childish petulance drives policy.", "title": "Living in the Trump Zone"}
