{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Toward the end of his comic opus on the press, politics and President Trump, the \u201cDaily Show\u201d comedian Hasan Minhaj looked out at the hundreds of journalists gathered in a subterranean hotel ballroom here on Saturday night and declared, \u201cThis has been one of the strangest events I have ever done in my life.\u201d The lengthy laughter and applause that followed made clear that he was not the only one who thought that way. No one knew quite what to expect at this year\u2019s edition of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, the chummy Washington ritual that became a flash point over press freedom in a year when the White House and its correspondents are anything but friendly. The president skipped the event. Celebrities stayed away. Comedians turned down the gig. But even as Mr. Trump heckled the proceedings in real time \u2014 joking at a Pennsylvania rally about reporters\u2019 \u201cconsoling each other in a Washington ballroom\u201d \u2014 attendees said the often-frivolous dinner felt oddly profound. Part pep rally, part therapy session, the event became a moment of catharsis for a political press corps that has faced months of unrelenting strain. Loud cheers and a palpable sense of defiance broke out when the president of the Correspondents\u2019 Association, Jeff Mason of Reuters, declared with sermonlike ferocity, \u201cWe are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.\u201d It was the longest ovation of the night. Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, seated on the dais, reminded the room of journalism\u2019s power, and Mr. Woodward articulated the subtext of the evening when he addressed Mr. Trump directly, saying, \u201cMr. President, the media is not fake news.\u201d Even Mr. Minhaj \u2014 who opened with a blistering takedown of Mr. Trump, noting that the president was \u201cin Pennsylvania because he can\u2019t take a joke\u201d \u2014 finished with an earnest ode to free speech. \u201cOnly in America can a first-generation immigrant Muslim kid get on this stage and make fun of the president,\u201d he said. The event \u201cwas a line-in-the-sand night, to an extent I didn\u2019t expect,\u201d E.J. Dionne, a longtime Washington chronicler, said in the ballroom afterward. He added that \u201chaving Woodward and Bernstein sends another message\u201d \u2014 that journalists can, under the right circumstances, topple a presidency. Promoting the First Amendment was, in the end, the safest possible angle for the Correspondents\u2019 Association, which liaises with the White House on behalf of its members and was wary of blasting the president in absentia. At one point, Mr. Mason recited the text of the amendment onstage, and an introductory video took pains to showcase clashes between previous presidents and the press, demonstrating that the news media\u2019s adversarial relationship with the presidency \u2014 which Mr. Mason called \u201chealthy\u2019\u2019 \u2014 did not start with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump raised the tension of the evening with his Pennsylvania rally, an event designed to underscore the contrast between tuxedoed Washington journalists celebrating themselves and the blue-collar supporters at his rally \u2014 \u201chard working Americans,\u201d as one senior administration official put it. Wary of looking biased, many prominent journalists in the ballroom kept a poker face during Mr. Minhaj\u2019s nastier punch lines. (He called Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, a \u201cNazi\u201d and labeled the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, a racist, moments quickly featured on Breitbart News and other right-wing news sites.) \u201cI was covering my mouth with my glass,\u201d said April D. Ryan, theWhite House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, as she fielded selfie requests on the ballroom floor. But as reporters fanned out to after-parties, they described the night as a needed tonic, to the celebrity-soaked atmosphere of recent Correspondents\u2019 dinners and the national climate of hostility toward the news media. Blake Hounshell, the editor of Politico Magazine, wrote on Twitter, \u201cThe WHCD may have lost some glitz tonight, but recovered its self-respect.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/business/white-house-correspondents-dinner.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T09:55:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T09:55:54-04:00", "abstract": "Even as President Trump heckled the proceedings in real time in Pennsylvania, guests said the often-frivolous dinner felt oddly profound.", "title": "For Journalists, Annual Dinner Serves Up Catharsis and Resolve"}
