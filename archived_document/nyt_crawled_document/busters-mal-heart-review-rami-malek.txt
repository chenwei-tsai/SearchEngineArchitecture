{"text": "In the oddly named \u201cBuster\u2019s Mal Heart,\u201d an unkempt vagrant (Rami Malek) wanders the hills of Montana, squatting in empty vacation homes and sometimes defecating in the cookware. Long known to the authorities as Buster, he calls in to radio shows to rant about a coming apocalypse. Once, in another life, Buster was a loving husband and father called Jonah and a sleep-deprived night clerk at a characterless hotel. Between the two identities lies a dreadful, transformative event; and as the movie toggles from one to the other, its writer and director, Sarah Adina Smith, conjures a storyboard of surreal puzzle pieces that snap together then suddenly split apart. So when a mysterious stranger (DJ Qualls) seems to offer Jonah freedom from his puritanical in-laws and soul-deadening job, we somehow know that escape is not on the table. Filmed with an alienating elegance by Shaheen Seth, \u201cBuster\u2019s Mal Heart\u201d is about the making of a madman. It also aspires, with less success, to philosophically query the void at the center of modern life and Christianity\u2019s failure to fill it. Religious homilies and paranoid exhortations spill from television sets where cartoons of men trapped in endlessly whirring machines dance dishearteningly. And if the story is too tricky to realize its themes or welcome the impatient, it also contains enough empathy to humanize a character who\u2019s part man, part spiritual symbol. That character is only a step away from Mr. Malek\u2019s delusional-hacker role on the television series \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d his gigantic eyes and repressed manner the movie\u2019s greatest assets. On some level, Ms. Smith seems to be saying, we are all Buster; we might just be better at holding things together.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/busters-mal-heart-review-rami-malek.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:48:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:48:16-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Malek, of \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d heads for the hills of Montana as a man fleeing a soul-deadening job and the burdens of modern life.", "title": "Review: Rami Malek as a Drifter With a Past in \u2018Buster\u2019s Mal Heart\u2019"}
