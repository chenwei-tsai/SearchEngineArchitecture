{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cThe L.G.B.T. Trump Fallacy\u201d (editorial, April 17): While President Trump\u2019s record so far may be murky, he has made pro-L.G.B.T. policy a matter of record. He has called sustained funding of H.I.V./AIDS programs \u201chighest priorities\u201d in his budget. He intends to preserve an executive order maintaining L.G.B.T. nondiscrimination in federal contracting. And he has preserved a State Department job tasked with advocating global L.G.B.T. human rights at a time when gay men are being rounded up, tortured and executed in Chechnya. His United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, issued a statement on the matter, declaring that the Trump administration is \u201cagainst all forms of discrimination, including against people based on sexual orientation.\u201d Your editorial closes by saying \u201cfor the foreseeable future, the federal courts are likely to be the only avenue of progress.\u201d That may be true, but the last three times the Supreme Court issued landmark rulings in support of L.G.B.T. equality, it was Justice Anthony M. Kennedy who wrote the opinions. Justice Kennedy was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, who was unfairly derided for being anti-gay. GREGORY T. ANGELO, WASHINGTON The writer is president of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of L.G.B.T. conservatives and straight allies.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/trump-isnt-anti-lgbt.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T11:59:19-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Letter", "created_date": "2017-04-27T11:59:19-04:00", "abstract": "The Log Cabin Republicans take issue with an editorial.", "title": "Trump Isn\u2019t Anti-L.G.B.T."}
