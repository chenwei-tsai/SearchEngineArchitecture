The exception is a trip that includes at least some help with child care \u2014 time when parents are free to luxuriate in that rarest of parental indulgences: time alone. But finding reliable, affordable child care can be enough of a challenge at home. Where does one even begin to get such help on the road? Here are five strategies for finding the right fit for your family. Child care is not cheap. And what\u2019s affordable for one family is out of reach for another. Just as at home, vacation child care needs vary wildly. The first \u2014 and most important \u2014 step in securing help on the road is deceptively simple: Honestly assess your family\u2019s wants versus needs, consider what kind of care you\u2019ll be comfortable with and realistically calculate what you can afford. For a lazy, leisurely beach vacation to Hawaii, Mexico or the Caribbean, a resort that includes on-site child care in its price may be the answer. A long weekend in an exciting city? Hiring a background-checked, highly reviewed babysitter on sites like care.com or urbansitter.com for a few evening hours may do the trick. The contours of your trip \u2014 whether you\u2019re traveling with one infant or three school-age children, for example \u2014 will determine what options are available to you. It may seem obvious, but it\u2019s worth stepping back and really taking stock of your needs. Many self-described family resorts offer some form of complimentary child care, but the setup and limitations vary. For example, Club Med Resorts offer \u201ckids clubs,\u201d a day-care-like setting that typically excludes children under the age of 4. At three North American locations \u2014 Sandpiper Bay in Florida, Ixtapa in Mexico and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic \u2014 babysitting is available for babies and toddlers (four months and older) for an additional $79 (low season) to $95 (high season) per day. But if your child is under 5, it\u2019s wise to check the specific requirements, such as whether a child is toilet trained. For infants and toddlers, babysitters are often available for one-on-one care for an additional fee. Kids\u2019 clubs are usually broken into different age groups, with the youngest children separated from bigger kids and teenagers. A handful of resorts, including Franklyn D. Resort in Runaway Bay, Jamaica, and the three Caribbean locations of Sandals\u2019 Beaches resorts, offer private \u201cvacation nannies\u201d \u2014 babysitters assigned to each family \u2014 at no additional cost. Having seen Jamaica\u2019s Franklyn D. Resort described in online forums as affordable, I was initially taken aback by the $340-a-night price tag for the least expensive room. But then I took a mental tally of everything that was included: transportation to and from the airport, three restaurant meals a day for two adults and a child, entertainment, top-shelf liquor, sports equipment and \u2014 the ultimate perk \u2014 full-time individual child care. While $170 per adult was still a splurge for our family, the trip suddenly seemed like a bargain. Babysitting alone is $12 to $17 an hour for one child in many parts of the United States, according to Urbansitter.com\u2019s annual child care rate survey. For parents who are uneasy about leaving their child with even a well-vetted stranger in an unfamiliar place, the best bet may be bringing along a family member, friend or trusted babysitter from home. Retired grandparents, who often have flexible schedules, seem to be a popular choice. But not all grandparents are up for the challenge, and, of course, not everyone considers a trip with their parents or in-laws a \u201cvacation.\u201d Other possibilities include a responsible niece or nephew \u2014 or another teenager in your life \u2014 who could benefit from travel themselves and help in exchange for the experience. When this works well, everybody wins. You get an extra set of diaper-changing hands, kid-wrangling skills and watchful eyes, and your travel companion-guest worker gets a free or nearly-free vacation. Clearly, this arrangement is the trickiest. It means not only finding the right person, but also agreeing on what help they will provide and what travel expenses you will cover. It important to make expectations, on both sides, clear. Consider traveling with another family and sharing the cost of a comfortable Airbnb or vacation rental. A two-family vacation doubles the number of adults on hand to look after the children. One set of parents can stay in during daytime naps or after the evening bedtime, while the other gets to enjoy some non-kid-friendly outings, like a strenuous hike or an evening of live music. By taking turns with babysitting duties, child care is free.
