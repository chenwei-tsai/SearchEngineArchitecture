{"text": "The summer blockbuster movie season kicks off when \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d hits multiplexes across America on Friday, May 5 \u2014 and it\u2019s a good time to take a look at the rest of the year\u2019s slate of big-screen superhero adventures. At this point, audiences have become familiar with the bright costumes, the computer-generated effects and the in-jokes for comic fans. And, in an added challenge for trailers, the summer films \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d don\u2019t represent their title characters\u2019 debuts on the silver screen \u2014 a trait shared by \u201cJustice League,\u201d which is slated for November. Here\u2019s how these three movies are trying to attract viewers to slightly familiar characters without feeling too formulaic. Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, popped up last year in \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d where she helped that film\u2019s heroes save the day and arguably stole the show from them. But the Amazon warrior received comparatively little screen time, and while her back story was alluded to, it was never fully realized. The new movie, due in June and directed by Patty Jenkins, looks like it will fill in the gaps. The first official trailer opened with a shot of Diana Prince, Wonder Woman\u2019s alter ego, looking at an old black-and-white photograph and reflecting on her past. The most recent preview, released in March, ditches the framing device and dives into her history even further, explicitly positioning the film as a conventional superhero origin story. The signal starts immediately, presenting a young Diana with a challenge she has to conquer. It\u2019s a classic biopic technique to make the chronological scope clear. Diana\u2019s mother tells her she\u2019s not fierce enough to wield a sword from the gods. Over the next two minutes, she proves otherwise. Challenge after challenge unfolds, and Diana rises to meet them, discovering her inner superhero one battle at a time. Piece by piece, the trailer rolls out the classic Wonder Woman symbols: First the indestructible bracelets, then the sword and the shield and, of course, the lasso of truth. By the end of the trailer, Diana strides into battle in full red-and-blue regalia, and her journey is complete. Still, the trailer makes sure to highlight what sets the movie apart from comic-book cinema: its gender dynamics. It has been more than a decade since a female-led superhero movie hit the big screen (remember \u201cElektra\u201d?), and while women like Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Black Widow have had important roles in big franchises, Diana stands alone. The trailer wisely highlights that, showing her sparring mostly with female partners and making the one male character, the military pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), into an outsider. In a crucial moment, Steve steps in front of Diana to protect her from a gunfight. But with the flick of a wrist, she is the one who saves him. The scene makes it instantly clear that Diana is not the typical damsel in distress of past comic-book adaptations. Steve looks suitably impressed; audiences probably will be, too. Let\u2019s get it out of the way: Peter Parker was bitten by a spider that gave him superpowers. We know this because we\u2019ve seen it twice onscreen in the last 15 years: in \u201cSpider-Man\u201d (2002) and again 10 years later in \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man.\u201d Now comes Tom Holland in the \u201cspider suit\u201d in \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d due in July. As with \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d the new film isn\u2019t this particular Spider-Man\u2019s debut; he popped up last year in \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201d That may be why the trailer for \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d which arrived in March, doesn\u2019t waste time on introductions. In 15 seconds, it establishes that Peter Parker has a high-tech suit and some powers, and that he knows how to use them. Then it skips to establishing a major setback in his heroic journey instead of explaining how he became a web-slinging crime fighter. As a result, the preview feels as if it\u2019s heralding a Spider-Man sequel rather than the first installment of a reboot. When Peter\u2019s in the back of a car with Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), we don\u2019t get any details of their shared history. (Tony is the one who gave Peter the suit.) The trailer doesn\u2019t give much insight into the film\u2019s villain or elaborate on its occasional references to Avengers movies past. Instead, it sets up a mentor-mentee dynamic for Peter and Tony, one that frays as Peter finds himself in a situation that he can\u2019t handle. Suddenly, the confidence he shows in the trailer\u2019s well-chosen first sequence is destroyed. That, in turn, is what raises the stakes and suspense in the subsequent action footage, which shows Spider-Man trying to restore his former glory and return to the status quo the trailer established so quickly. Unlike with Wonder Woman, whose future has already been glimpsed onscreen, it\u2019s not quite as clear whether Peter Parker will succeed. If introducing or reintroducing a hero who is suddenly headlining his own movie is a challenge, the trailer for \u201cJustice League\u201d has to highlight five of them. The film is both a sequel to \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d and the origin story of the crime-fighting team that lends the new movie its title. Its muddled preview tries to split the difference. Like the trailer for \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d the preview for \u201cJustice League\u201d jumps into the familiar, using as a framing device a conversation between Wonder Woman and Batman (that\u2019s Ben Affleck this time, not Christian Bale). They allude to a vague threat, giving the trailer its only real sense of intrigue, before getting right to the point: the other heroes who are joining their superhuman team. One by one, shots of Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and the Flash (Ezra Miller) pop up, accompanied by snippets of bios in voice-overs. These three had cameos in \u201cBatman v Superman,\u201d but audiences were told even less about them than they learned about Wonder Woman. In this case, the trailer for \u201cJustice League\u201d offers glimpses that are a preamble to a group shot of the new team. There\u2019s not much more on display here; what follows are big, sweeping action sequences that take the audience\u2019s familiarity with these characters as a given. All five heroes get to shine in fight scenes as a cover of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cCome Together\u201d blares. But the characters hardly do; shot after shot shows them fighting in isolation, exhibiting their powers and helping what appears to be the movie\u2019s sixth star: C.G.I.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/justice-league-spider-man-wonder-woman.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:41:34-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:41:34-04:00", "abstract": "A look at efforts to make superheroes we\u2019ve seen before stand out at crowded multiplexes.", "title": "\u2018Wonder Woman,\u2019 \u2018Spider-Man\u2019 and How Trailers Push the Familiar"}
