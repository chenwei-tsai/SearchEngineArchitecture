Whitney.\u201d Mr. Davis, 85, has been one of the dons of the music business for half a century, and is now the chief creative officer of Sony Music. His career is the subject of a documentary, \u201cClive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives,\u201d directed by Chris Perkel, which will open the Tribeca Film Festival on Wednesday, with a screening and a concert at Radio City Music Hall. The names on the bill, all artists Mr. Davis has worked with over his career, show some of his breadth, and his pull: Ms. Franklin, Jennifer Hudson, Dionne Warwick, Carly Simon, Barry Manilow and the band Earth, Wind & Fire. In a recent interview, Mr. Davis discussed his improbable entry into the record business; why he never stops worrying; and how he dealt with some of the setbacks in his career, like being fired from Columbia Records and implicated in a payola scandal that he says unfairly smeared him. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation. You started as a lawyer, and early in the film you say, \u201cI knew nothing about music.\u201d How do you account for the career you\u2019ve had? Through both luck and fate, I discovered on the job that I had a natural gift that I never knew I had. The gift is to determine who could be a long-lasting, major star. And from a repertoire point of view, those songs that are capable of becoming first a hit record \u2014 how they could be arranged, sung, performed \u2014 and hopefully be one of those very few hit records that become standards. Did you have any doubts about your ability to do that? I\u2019ve always said that I get paid a lot of money to worry. It\u2019s worrying until you\u2019ve come to the right conclusion, and when you\u2019ve come to that conclusion, you move. You see it in the film, with \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d where [the producer] David Foster called me up, and right away I said, \u201cI absolutely love it.\u201d And as he kept sending more versions of it, it was sounding slick. It was sounding less pure. And you anguish over it. There was a big movie coming out, and we didn\u2019t have a single. But then you just reach down and say, it\u2019s D-Day. And I went with the first, rough version. It is that natural, hearing it and just knowing that this is what will give people goose pimples. Simon and Garfunkel were aghast that I chose \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water\u201d to be the first single. Yes, it was a ballad; yes, it was lengthy. But you\u2019ve got to know when you have a home run. You can\u2019t play everything by the rules. Barry Manilow, who was your first artist at Arista, had wanted a career as a songwriter, but most of his hits were written by other people. In the film, you say the two of you reached a compromise about that. But in your memoir you were harsher, telling him, \u201cWell, if you were Irving Berlin, we would know it by now!\u201d That dialogue occurred right before he went to RCA. After one album of working with another team, he viewed his entire career differently, and he came back. We had to coexist with him being a writer, and it ended up very felicitously. When you\u2019re a pop artist, you need to have hits on every album. You hear him in the film say that every song I gave him was a hit. For his own songs \u2014 \u201cCopacabana,\u201d \u201cThis One\u2019s for You\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. There were artists like Melissa Manchester. She was on her way to a platinum-plus career, and she said, \u201cI want to be Joni Mitchell and I want to write my own material.\u201d So, of course, you allow that to happen. You have to have respect for the artist and the kind of career they want. But that\u2019s only in the entertainment pop world, where either you have a hit or you don\u2019t. It\u2019s not \u201cthe answer is blowin\u2019 in the wind.\u201d When you\u2019re a Patti Smith, when you\u2019re a Bruce Springsteen, when you\u2019re a rock artist, I would never think of submitting material.   After you were fired from Columbia Records in 1973 and investigated, you lost your license to practice law. But decades later you studied to pass the bar again. Why was it so important to do that? It was a very tough period to go through, and to the extent that the exoneration did not get the exposure that the original headlines did, I feel gratified that the actual record is getting out there. For myself, I wanted to bring up to date the fact that there should be no question mark on the record. Plus, I love school and I love exams, and I had no problem doing it. You turned 85 recently. Are you still hunting for hits? Yes. I\u2019m looking for hits for Jennifer Hudson; looking for hits for a new artist, Avery Wilson; and coming up with a concept album for Johnny Mathis, who still sings great. It\u2019s called \u201cJohnny Mathis Sings the Great New American Songbook.\u201d I still love it. And whether it\u2019s doing those albums, or doing my Grammy party every year, it\u2019s a great feeling. I got into this totally by luck, and it\u2019s just wonderfully fulfilling.
