{"text": "Investigators in a Dallas suburb on Monday were examining body camera footage to piece together the events leading up to an officer\u2019s fatal shooting of a 15-year-old high school student over the weekend, a spokesman said. Jordan Edwards, a freshman at Mesquite High School in Balch Springs, was shot while a passenger in a vehicle on Saturday night, police and school officials said. According to a police statement, officers were responding to a 911 call reporting drunken young people when they heard gunfire from an \u201cunknown altercation,\u201d and then a car backed down the street toward them in an \u201caggressive manner.\u201d The statement said an officer opened fire, striking a front seat passenger, who died from his injuries at a hospital. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have all the facts,\u201d Officer Pedro Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Balch Springs Police Department, said in a brief telephone interview. He said body camera footage from officers who were at the shooting was being examined by the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Department and police department investigators. He declined to answer further questions but said more information was likely to be released on Monday as officers were given a chance to \u201cdecompress\u201d and be interviewed. The police did not immediately release the child\u2019s name in its statement, published on Sunday and sent by email on Monday. But the victim was identified by friends and family in local media reports. A Dallas County Medical Examiner\u2019s report obtained on Monday ruled the death a homicide caused by a \u201crifle wound\u201d to the head. On Monday, the Mesquite Independent School District released a photograph of Jordan, who was in the ninth grade. \u201cHe was a good student who was very well liked by his teachers, coaches and his fellow students,\u201d according to the district. \u201cThe entire district \u2014 especially the staff and students of Mesquite High School \u2014 are mourning this terrible loss.\u201d Lee Merritt, an attorney for the Edwards family, told a local television station that there was no aggression from the vehicle and none of the occupants were armed. \u201cThey were simply leaving a party where they believed danger was, so I can\u2019t wrap my mind around why an officer decided to shoot into the car,\u201d said Mr. Merritt, according to WFAA. He did not immediately return a telephone call on Monday. The shooting has unnerved Balch Springs, a city of about 23,000 people that lies about 15 miles east of downtown Dallas. On Sunday, coaches and community members showed up at a news conference demanding answers from the authorities and expressing frustration over a lack of information, WFAA reported. \u201cGreat kid. Awesome parents. He was not a thug. This shouldn\u2019t happen to him,\u201d said Chris Cano, whose son played football with Jordan, according to the station. The first day of spring football practice at Mesquite High School was canceled on Monday because Jordan, all 150 pounds and nearly six-feet-tall of him, would not be walking onto the field for warm-ups and drills. His teammates are grieving, said Jeff Fleener, the coach of the high school team, called the Skeeters. Sheer athleticism aside, Jordan\u2019s \u201cbig smile\u201d would be missed by his team, Mr. Fleener said in a telephone interview on Monday. \u201cI met Jordan on day one and learned his name very quickly just because of the type of kid he was,\u201d said Mr. Fleener. He said Jordan was a committed athlete who was often seen either working out in the weight room or surrounded by the camaraderie of teammates in the locker room and on the field. He had aspirations to play college football, and was trying out for the team\u2019s defensive position, Mr. Fleener said. \u201cHe was tall and strong, a guy that spent a lot of time in the weight room to make himself better, bigger and stronger,\u201d Mr. Fleener said. \u201cThe big thing is he was not scared to come hit somebody on the football field. Off the field, his big smile lit up a room, but he knew how to flip that switch on the field and play with some physicality.\u201d \u201cHe was everybody\u2019s friend \u2014 his attitude and smile, everything was just contagious about him. He was excellent \u2014 3.5 GPA, never in trouble, no attendance issues,\u201d said Mr. Fleener. \u201cHe was a kid that did everything right.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/dallas-police-teen-shooting.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T15:04:46-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T15:04:46-04:00", "abstract": "Jordan Edwards was shot late on Saturday when the police in a Dallas suburb were responding to a call reporting young people drinking.", "title": "Texas Police Shoot and Kill Student, 15"}
