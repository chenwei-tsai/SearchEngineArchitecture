{"abstract": "A colorful message from Garnett before Game 3 on Friday night resonated with a team that had a difficult week.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "CHICAGO \u2014 Before the Boston Celtics regained some confidence, they heard from a familiar voice. Kevin Garnett, a key member of the Celtics\u2019 championship team in 2008, has kept busy since he retired from the N.B.A. at the end of last season. He hosts a television talk show. He works with various teams as a sort of independent adviser/big-man coach. And he offers unsolicited pep talks. Garnett seized the opportunity to deliver one such talk after watching the Celtics lose the first two games of their first-round playoff series against the Chicago Bulls. He reached out to Ed Lacerte, the Celtics\u2019 longtime trainer, and left him a message. Lacerte shared it with Avery Bradley, who shared it with Isaiah Thomas, who shared it with the rest of the team before Game 3 on Friday night. \u201cWe played it very loud,\u201d the Celtics\u2019 Jae Crowder said. \u201cYou can only imagine how he got us pumped up.\u201d More than anything, Crowder said, Garnett wanted the team to play with more joy \u2014 no easy thing after such a difficult week. But the message resonated with the top-seeded Celtics, whose 104-87 victory at the United Center was sorely needed. The Bulls still have a two-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven series, which will resume here Sunday evening. But all their momentum is gone \u2014 undercut by the absence of Rajon Rondo, their starting point guard, and by a resurgent opponent, which turned to an effective small-ball lineup in Game 3. \u201cIt made us more versatile,\u201d the Celtics\u2019 Al Horford said. So many things that seemed to affect Friday\u2019s game happened before it even began. Sure, there was Garnett\u2019s colorful message, which the Celtics cited as a factor in their improved play. More significant was the Bulls\u2019 surprise announcement that Rondo, after playing so well in the first two games of the series, had fractured his right thumb in Game 2 and would be out indefinitely. Wearing a cast and a short-sleeve blazer, Rondo watched Friday\u2019s proceedings from the bench. Without him, the Bulls lacked any semblance of organization. Jimmy Butler labored for open looks, clanging his way to a 7-of-21 shooting night. Jerian Grant and Michael Carter-Williams, Rondo\u2019s overmatched fill-ins, combined for 8 points, 3 assists and 7 turnovers. Rondo said he would try to help his younger teammates without being overbearing. As for his potential return, he said the doctors had told him that it would be a couple of weeks. \u201cI can\u2019t even pick up a ball right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even use a fork or use my thumb. I\u2019ll take a couple of days and see how it feels.\u201d This, of course, is problematic for the Bulls, just when they seemed to be assembling the jagged pieces of their season. They barely qualified for the playoffs, and then, as the eighth seed, took the first two games from the host Celtics. Chicago was buzzing. But the Bulls could not compensate for Rondo\u2019s absence in Game 3, and the Celtics knew it. \u201cThey\u2019re a totally different team,\u201d Crowder said. Boston had 34 assists on 41 field goals \u2014 a reflection, in part, of Coach Brad Stevens\u2019s decision to switch up his starting lineup. He summoned Gerald Green, a swingman and a solid outside shooter, from the deep recesses of his bench to replace Amir Johnson, who typically starts at center. With four players stationed on the perimeter, the Celtics stretched the Bulls\u2019 defenders like rubber bands. And without Johnson clogging up the lane, Horford \u2014 the Celtics\u2019 lone post player for long stretches \u2014 had more room to roll to the basket for layups and dunks. He finished with 18 points. \u201cIt starts with Isaiah,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a tough guard. Once he gets into the defense and kicks it out, and we\u2019re making the next pass and the next pass and the next pass \u2014 everyone\u2019s touching the ball. That\u2019s fun basketball. Everyone\u2019s playing with confidence. Everyone understands that they can take whatever shots come their way.\u201d Thomas is playing through grief. He has not spoken publicly since the death of his younger sister in a car accident last week. After playing in the first two games of the series, he returned home to the Seattle area to spend time with his family. He rejoined his teammates in Chicago ahead of Game 3. \u201cHe\u2019s still hurting,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe have to maintain the perspective that there\u2019s going to be some real ups and downs, and that\u2019s just part of it. We\u2019re here to support him, and we\u2019re going to do our jobs and play and coach basketball. But we understand that there is a bigger picture and we are here as his support network that\u2019s in Boston.\u201d Thomas has somehow managed to compartmentalize his emotions. On Friday, he was at his best in third quarter. He sank back-to-back 3-pointers to push the lead to 9. Later, sensing pressure on the perimeter, he cut through traffic for a reverse layup before finding Horford for layups on consecutive possessions. \u201cThe amount of attention they put on Isaiah is huge,\u201d the Celtics\u2019 Kelly Olynyk said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to double him coming off picks, somebody\u2019s going to be open. We just have to be ready.\u201d Terry Rozier, a reserve guard for the Celtics, said he could sense at practice before Game 3 that the team was struggling. It was understandable. \u201cIt seemed like everybody was still down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried to get guys to tell jokes, just to lighten up a little bit.\u201d On Friday, with an assist from Garnett, the mood finally lifted. Now, the Celtics are just trying to move forward.", "section": "Sports", "title": "Celtics Regain Confidence, With an Assist From Kevin Garnett", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/sports/basketball/boston-celtics-kevin-garnett-isaiah-thomas.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T13:26:20-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T13:26:20-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
