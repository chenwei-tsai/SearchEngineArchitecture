The Coney Island Circus Sideshow is open for the season. It\u2019s one of the few remaining sideshows in America, where you can still be dazzled by a fire breather, spooked by a snake charmer or shocked by the human blockhead. Among the band of performers in Brooklyn is Kiri Hochendoner, a sword swallower known on stage as Betty Bloomerz. At 5 feet 4 inches tall, Ms. Hochendoner can swallow a 2-foot 4-inch sword. And it\u2019s not a trick. \u201cThe scariest swords are the ones that stop right behind your heart,\u201d Ms. Hochendoner said. \u201cYou can feel the temperature of the metal against that part of your body. It\u2019s very sensory and you experience your organs in a totally different way.\u201d There are few professional sword swallowers these days, said Dan Meyer, the president of the Sword Swallowers Association International, which keeps records of the number, training and capabilities of performers. Less than a third of the sword swallowers documented by the association are women. Performing on stage as many as eight times a day, Ms. Hochendoner slides larger and larger swords down her throat, often letting them drop a few inches before catching them with her teeth, throat and stomach muscles. To achieve this she tilts her head back and relaxes her throat while suppressing the gag reflex. She navigates the blade down the esophagus, past the epiglottis and into the chest, where it\u2019s separated from her heart by about an eighth of an inch of tissue. From there, the sword is guided past the sternum, through the diaphragm and past the liver and kidneys until it reaches the bottom of her stomach. Is it dangerous? You bet. \u201cOnce there was a sword in me and it nicked the back side of my stomach,\u201d Ms. Hochendoner said, calling it her only injury in the decade she has spent swallowing swords. \u201cLike any loving relationship, you have to listen and ask your body, and sometimes it\u2019s not the right time to go all the way.\u201d But the risk, Ms. Hochendoner said, is worth it. \u201cI want an honest reaction,\u201d from the audience, she said, and she usually gets it. \u201cWhether it\u2019s extraordinarily surprised or extraordinarily disgusted or happy. Whatever their reaction is, it\u2019s always extraordinary.\u201d The Congress of Curious Peoples \u2014 a 10-day festival of discussions, lectures and sideshow performances from entertainers across the United States \u2014 kicks off today in Coney Island. You can also catch a performance of the Coney Island sideshow through the end of summer. Here\u2019s what else is happening: The weather is performing stunts of its own \u2014 sunny, rainy, warm, chilly and back again all week long. Today will be wet. Be on guard for showers and thunderstorms, with a high of 62. We\u2019ll be flip-flopping between clear and cloudy, dry and drizzly all weekend.

Newspaper racks in the city are in need of a serious makeover. At least that\u2019s the message of the Midtown South Community Council with its News Rack/Newspaper Dispenser Design Contest. The council is seeking designs for newspaper racks that can withstand life on the mean streets of New York. Namely, dispensers that can survive graffiti, vandalism and bad weather; can be placed on crowded sidewalks without being knocked over; and won\u2019t impede pedestrians. (The news dispensers must also meet regulations from the Department of Transportation.) Think you can design a more dapper dispenser? You can win up to $2,500. Submissions are being accepted until July 31. New York Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. till late morning. You can receive it via email.
