{"published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "abstract": "Live performance is a most direct way to make the fear and heartbreak palpable.", "text": "The day of a recent school shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., the superintendent of the local school district offered parents guidance on how to talk with their children about the incident, in which a teacher, an 8-year-old student and the gunman all died. \u201cBe willing to listen to their story and be willing to listen to their story multiple times,\u201d the superintendent said. \u201cReassure them that the danger that they faced has passed.\u201d It was kind and sensible advice, and if I hadn\u2019t read it in a news story on my way home from seeing \u201cChurch & State,\u201d an Off Broadway play that takes forceful exception to the pervasive gun violence in the United States, the words might not have struck me the way they did. As it was, I couldn\u2019t help thinking that the broader danger had not at all passed, and that there\u2019s no assuaging the generalized dread that courses through our culture with every fresh headline-grabbing slaughter, and in between. \u201cI for one am tired of being afraid,\u201d a Southern senator says in the play, reversing his stance on gun control after a massacre at his children\u2019s school. On stage after stage lately, playwrights have been confronting such fears about gun violence, adding their works to a genre that has blossomed like a furious bruise in recent years. No single work encompasses the enormous scope of the issue. Yet together they tell a story that demands our willingness to listen, and to listen again. Cite the numbers, and the problem instantly becomes too vast to grasp: More than 33,000 people killed and upward of 78,000 wounded by firearms each year in the United States, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Most of those aren\u2019t going to make the news, and unless they are especially heinous or close to home, aren\u2019t we a little inured to the ones that do? This is where the stealthy power of theater has an advantage, at least theoretically. There are dramas involving shootings in schools (\u201cPunk Rock,\u201d \u201cThe Faculty Room,\u201d \u201cThe Library\u201d) and workplaces (\u201cGloria\u201d); attacks spurred by politics (\u201cThe Events\u201d), racism (\u201cMother Emanuel\u201d) or mental illness (\u201cHolden\u201d). There are plays focused on bystanders for whom gun killings are an everyday trauma (\u201cPass Over\u201d) or a surreal aberration (\u201cWhen It\u2019s You\u201d). Other shows are some combination of the above (\u201cOn the Exhale,\u201d \u201cChurch & State,\u201d \u201cThe Assignment\u201d). News reports arrive after the fact, but theater can meddle with time and dimension, showing us the before, the during, the yet to come \u2014 as in Nathan Yungerberg\u2019s \u201cEsai\u2019s Table,\u201d which trails three black teenagers just past the threshold of the afterlife, where we come to understand what their needless, unwilling absence from the world will mean. Plays can put us in the room or on the street corner to eavesdrop on unguarded moments, on music and laughter \u2014 as in Rajendra Ramoon Maharaj, Adam Mace and Christian Lee Branch\u2019s \u201cMother Emanuel,\u201d a gospel-music celebration of the people gunned down at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. There is intimacy to that, because there is no glowing screen to separate us from the grief and devastation. The experience is visceral and enveloping in a way that the news is not. We may even forget that we are safe. In Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman\u2019s musical \u201cAssassins\u201d (1990), about murderers and would-be murderers of United States presidents, there is a famous moment when Charles Guiteau, the killer of President James A. Garfield, trains his gun on the audience. Mr. Sondheim wrote in his book \u201cLook, I Made a Hat\u201d: \u201cIn every production I\u2019ve seen, as his affability froze and he slowly panned over the crowd, not missing a patron, there has been a hush more chilling than at any moment in \u2018Sweeney Todd.\u2019 Facing the barrel of a gun, even when it\u2019s just in a musical, is the kind of shock that can exist only in live theater.\u201d This is true, and it worked precisely as intended the night I saw \u201cAssassins\u201d this spring at Yale Repertory Theater. The show itself, which gets at the congenital nature of this nation\u2019s gun love, has a contemporary resonance that has only grown with the years. But it catapulted me backward, too, in an unexpected way: A scent wafted from the stage that reminded me of the cap guns my childhood best friend and his brothers used to play with. One of them, in young adulthood, would be murdered by a stranger with a gun. I\u2019ve known three people who have died at the barrel of a gun, two from suicide. That feels like a high number to me, but Antoinette Nwandu\u2019s urgent, poetic \u201cPass Over\u201d \u2014 which I saw a year ago in a Cherry Lane Theater Mentor Project showcase, and which Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago will stage in June \u2014 persuades me that this perception is relative. In her play, two young black men in a bullet-riddled neighborhood of an unidentified American city are listing the people they\u2019ve known who\u2019ve been killed. \u201cAndre,\u201d Kitch says, 15 names in. \u201cWhich Andre?\u201d his friend Moses asks. \u201cBoth,\u201d says Kitch, who has many more names to add. The play, which transports the audience to the block that Kitch and Moses are eager to leave for a better life, captures in a way I have never encountered elsewhere the paralyzing effect of constant violence. Fearful of being shot by the police (\u201cYou heard they picked off Ed, though, right?\u201d Kitch asks), these tough and likable guys repeatedly flinch at the sound \u2014 or, sometimes, in anticipation of the sound \u2014 of gunfire. The most haunting such play that I\u2019ve seen, \u201cPass Over\u201d requires no prop guns or fake blood. It relies on suggestion, and it is terrifying: both the physical danger and the existential despair. The knot that will need untangling if anything is ever truly to change for Kitch and Moses is viciously snarled. Getting us to look at that and comprehend it, to take us outside our own experience and alter us somehow by the time we leave the theater: That\u2019s part of the charge for an artist wrestling with an issue as momentous as this. Yet the genre is still waiting for its great works. Too often there is a sense of preaching, perhaps angrily, to the choir, unspooling dramas whose reliably infuriating outlines we already know from the news. The graphic representation of carnage \u2014 in plays like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s \u201cGloria\u201d and Simon Stephens\u2019s \u201cPunk Rock,\u201d both of which are less about a particular instance of violence than the events surrounding it \u2014 can be a way of startling us into awareness, making witnesses out of observers. Yet such special effects often threaten to overwhelm a play, becoming its gory centerpiece, the thing that everyone talks about (or, in the case of \u201cGloria,\u201d is asked not to, so as not to ruin the surprise). There is a macabre fascination to seeing blood spilled onstage. But does it take us any further in our understanding than an article in the newspaper, or the bystanders\u2019 videos that can show us, online at any moment of any day, some person we\u2019ve never met being shot to death? Where theater excels is in activating our imaginations and our empathy \u2014 coaxing us into picturing vivid scenarios inside our own heads. We can\u2019t avert our gaze from those. Sensationalism, self-righteousness, sentimentality \u2014 there are plenty of traps lying in wait for playwrights examining gun violence. Jason Odell Williams\u2019s \u201cChurch & State\u201d leads awkwardly with comedy, then begins to preach as its politician protagonist decides that action, not prayer, is the sensible response in the wake of horror. William Electric Black\u2019s \u201cThe Faculty Room,\u201d set in a high school and running through April 30 at Theater for the New City, is indeed didactic, instructing the audience about the nexus of the Second Amendment and urban ills. Camilo Almonacid\u2019s \u201cThe Assignment,\u201d staged by Houses on the Moon Theater Company through May 7 at A.R.T./New York Theaters, struggles to make a mother\u2019s long-ago loss of her son to gun violence as sympathetic as the bumbling efforts of a sweet ex-con (memorably played by Erick Betancourt) to forge a new life nearly 20 years after he pulled the trigger on someone. Among the most harrowing stage moments involving a firearm that I\u2019ve seen lately, in fact, wasn\u2019t in a gun play. It was in Stephan Wolfert\u2019s autobiographical military monologue \u201cCry Havoc!\u201d for the theater company Bedlam, when he re-enacted a suicidal impulse, miming the sawed-off shotgun he jammed up against his jaw. Clearly he didn\u2019t go through with it, but I couldn\u2019t get the worry out of my head: Does he still own guns? After the show, because I know him as a reporter, I did the intrusive thing and asked. My whole body relaxed when he said no. Last Sunday night, I saw another Houses on the Moon production called \u201cGun Country,\u201d which continues through May 3 at A.R.T./New York Theaters. Directed by Jenna Worsham, it is a program not of plays but of stories told by people whose lives have been touched by guns, sometimes in positive ways. One of the most potent tales is Ms. Worsham\u2019s own, which begins with a warm recollection of her teenage Southern self getting the 12-gauge Beretta semiautomatic she\u2019d longed for. Ms. Worsham is a Manhattanite now, and her views on gun control have evolved. But she understands people who regard regulation as \u201ca dirty word,\u201d as she puts it. She looks at the people she\u2019s known all her life who hold views that she abhors, and she loves them anyway \u2014 an extraordinary ability in this riven culture of ours.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/theater/the-pen-and-the-trigger-finger-examining-gun-violence-onstage.html", "material_type_facet": "News", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:28-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "title": "The Pen and the Trigger Finger: Examining Gun Violence Onstage", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:28-04:00"}
