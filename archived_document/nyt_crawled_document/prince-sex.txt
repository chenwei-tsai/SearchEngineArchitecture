{"text": "At work, propped against a wall, near piles of stuff, stands an Elvis Presley cutout. It\u2019s made of cardboard, pretty beat up, taller than I am and not the greatest photo. (He looks drunk. So does his lam\u00e9 suit.) But I pass that cutout almost every day, and every day I have the same thought. Elvis was hot. He was a musician, but he didn\u2019t have to be playing music for you to feel this way. Cardboard would do. That\u2019s charisma. And the only star who had more than Elvis was Prince. His hotness differed, of course; it came from somewhere else. Cardboard won\u2019t cut it for him. If Elvis was sex, Prince was a sexual orientation. His own. And it was oriented toward you. And you. And you. Name a pop act from the 1980s, and, amazingly, androgyny was somewhere in the mix: Thompson Twins, the Human League, pick a hair-metal act. For Boy George and Jermaine Stewart, it was the whole mix. Most of these guys were vague on gender and passive on desire: \u201cHold Me Now\u201d; \u201cDon\u2019t You Want Me?\u201d Guys, if you have to ask \u2026 Officially, Prince wasn\u2019t gay. But was he straight? Did he blow out his hair, love heels and platforms, and own every look, from flouncy Romantic consumptive to bathhouse matador to Easter Sunday deacon? He did. On \u201cControversy,\u201d he rhetorically poses the question: \u201cAm I straight or gay?\u201d And yet it never seemed to matter. Even after he changed his name to the symbol of the male gender sign overlaid atop its female counterpart, he was always only ever Prince. And how not vague was he? How not passive? He always knew what he wanted, and most of the time that was you. He could plead, the way he does on \u201cIf I Was Your Girlfriend,\u201d from \u201cSign O\u2019 the Times,\u201d a magnum opus from 1987 where Prince tries seduction by hypothetical role-play. But he keeps hitting a wall, and gets testy. It\u2019s a gorgeous conflation of sexual intensity and sex comedy, Prince as feminist and Pep\u00e9 Le Pew. He wasn\u2019t a breakup artist (\u201cPurple Rain\u201d is a rare \u201cit\u2019s over\u201d song). He was both a build-you-up artist and a breakdown master. The building-up includes luscious ballads like \u201cAdore,\u201d \u201cStill Would Stand All Time,\u201d and \u201cPink Cashmere.\u201d And a lot of what broke him down was lust. At some black churches, the high point of the service involves somebody catching the holy spirit. The high point of some Prince songs involves him catching the horny spirit. \u201cKiss\u201d is basically a danceable personal ad (\u201cU don\u2019t have to be beautiful to turn me on\u201d), and when he loses it at the end, screaming, \u201cAin\u2019t no particular sign I\u2019m more compatible with,\u201d it\u2019s like he\u2019s been out on his 14th different date with a woman who wants to talk astrology. He just wants to go home with the right lady. And where is she? Carnality was to Prince what photosynthesis is to plants. And in this metaphor, as befits a man famous for playing all his own instruments, he\u2019s also the bee, pollinating pleasure. On his records, he could be artistically and sexually promiscuous. But he was curious and studious of whomever he was with, too. And sometimes it could all make him seem ridiculous without equal. Take \u201cThe Continental.\u201d It\u2019s a jam in the middle of 1992\u2019s \u201cLove Symbol\u201d album, the least properly rated of his underrated records (it\u2019s the one with \u201cSexy MF\u201d and \u201c7,\u201d one of his vaguest but very best songs). On it, he makes an entreaty: \u201cTell me how you want to be done,\u201d and it conjures images of a man standing at the sex grill in a \u201c[bleep] the cook\u201d apron. This is to say that Prince, in his music, wasn\u2019t shy. (The first song on the \u201cLove Symbol\u201d album announces, \u201cMy name is Prince, and I am funky.\u201d) Some of that was the music: the thump of a kick drum; the way his drum programming could sound as if it was knocking on crates, doors, clouds; the wizardly keyboard work; his alchemical synthesis of James Brown\u2019s precision, Parliament-Funkadelic\u2019s shape shifts, the fraying blues of Jimi Hendrix and Betty Davis\u2019s grit. Some of this was the songwriting. He was a terrific poet. And terrific poetry can be thrilling to recite, even if it gets you sent to the principal\u2019s office or slapped in the face. For Sheena Easton, he wrote a song that no 9-year-old could resist. It was called \u201cSugar Walls.\u201d Take it from me: \u201cSugar Walls\u201d will land you in detention. Prince knew. On that one, he used the pseudonym Alexander Nevermind, presumably so that when the song enraged Tipper Gore, the head of the Parents Music Resource Center \u2014 and it did \u2014 he could restring his guitars in peace. Obviously, Prince saved his best stuff for himself. None of his peers had better randy songs about attraction. No one had a better falsetto ad lib for lust, either: \u201cOwah!\u201d You\u2019d have to go back to the blues or forward to hip-hop for rivals. Consider \u201cRaspberry Beret,\u201d the first single from 1985\u2019s \u201cAround the World in a Day.\u201d After the hard edges of the songs on \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d here was something totally new: melting strings, finger cymbals and a melody that sails upward like a let-go balloon. Lyrically, it\u2019s the first cousin of \u201cLittle Red Corvette,\u201d a filthy one-night-stand song that should also get you in trouble but whose metaphors \u2014 and singing \u2014 are too virtuosic for condemnation. The story Prince tells in \u201cRaspberry Beret\u201d is practically a short one. A girl walks into the store where the narrator\u2019s half-working, and he rides off to some idyllic place that\u2019s ideal for doing it. This is a song I favor at karaoke. I like the complete sentences, and the confident language makes me feel sexy. But the bridge is the reason I like to sing it. I haven\u2019t found a better one. \u201cRain sounds so cool/when it hits the barn roof/and the horses wonder who U are/Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees/U feel like a movie star.\u201d For lots of other artists, that would be enough. But there\u2019s more, because he was clearly on a roll: \u201cThey say the first time ain\u2019t the greatest/But I tell you/if I had the chance to do it all again/I wouldn\u2019t change a stroke/ \u2019cause baby I\u2019m the most/with a girl as fine as she was then.\u201d By the end, he\u2019s caught the horny ghost. The story is so gorgeously worded that I can see what\u2019s happening. Prince was never a big fan of music videos \u2014 the ones he does appear in aren\u2019t great. But with lyrics this good, they didn\u2019t have to be. Too many of Prince\u2019s sex songs are too perfect to assert that any one is better than the rest. But if you made me pick the best composed, conceived and executed of that class of songs, I\u2019d choose \u201cRaspberry Beret.\u201d At least, I would today. Unsurprisingly, the thing about Prince and sex is that you have to be in the mood. He\u2019s great enough to seduce you, but sometimes you want to sweat, sometimes you don\u2019t. And for sweat, I\u2019m partial to the frustration jams like \u201cTambourine,\u201d a song from \u201cAround the World in a Day\u201d that should have been released as a single. It\u2019s dirty, but it\u2019s no \u201cSugar Walls.\u201d \u201cTambourine\u201d has a tight funk that rattles and thrums. And the screaming is ecstatic. Even better was the slinkier funk of \u201cHot Thing,\u201d which appears on 1987\u2019s \u201cSign O\u2019 the Times.\u201d It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of screaming to Prince\u2019s hotness. It means something. He, Madonna, and Michael Jackson are the biggest and most important pop stars of the 1980s and early \u201990s, and of the three, it\u2019s Prince who could really embed different expressions of lust in his songwriting. Madonna embodied it. Jackson made it sound like a gospel emergency and had more control over that roaring register. But I don\u2019t know that Prince wanted control. Losing it was built into the songs. He never lost it more than on \u201cDarling Nikki,\u201d a song from \u201cPurple Rain\u201d whose notoriety precedes it. All that really happens is that some woman named Nikki \u2014 \u201cI guess you could say she was a sex fiend\u201d \u2014 sleeps with the narrator and is leaving when he wakes up. I was 9 when the album came out, and the P.M.R.C. campaign against the song must have reached my mother because I was told I couldn\u2019t have a copy. So I didn\u2019t spend much time with that song until I was an adult. It wasn\u2019t until I took a long drive with a friend that I actually heard \u201cDarling Nikki.\u201d We listened to \u201cPurple Rain\u201d four times. That\u2019s enough to catch new things. We heard the screaming. It wasn\u2019t from an orgasm but from pain. He\u2019s wailing. Then we noticed that pain was tied to the frenzied beating of a kick drum and wondered if the P.M.R.C. heard that, too. Prince eventually expunged the song from his live repertoire. He\u2019d become more conservative and more religious. But speaking practically, who can keep up that level of frustration? There\u2019s something about the way Prince hits bottom that makes me think that he never wanted to go back there, to having sex alone. Raspberry berets for everybody! His interest in partnership and flattery and pleasure were hot \u2014 to his partner, but especially to him. In his music, he offers to dance naked ballets and catch the other person\u2019s germs. He would brag about himself. He would also spread the boasting around. His name was Prince, and he was funky. But the hot thing?
