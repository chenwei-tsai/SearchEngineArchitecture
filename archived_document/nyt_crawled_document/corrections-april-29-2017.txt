{"text": "NATIONAL An article on Friday about the vaquita, an endangered porpoise, referred incorrectly to future budgets for the government offices that employ two scientists, Dr. Frances Gulland and Robert L. Brownell. The offices face major budget cuts; the entire budgets of both offices are not threatened. In addition, a capsule summary for the article misidentified the organism whose bladder is prized in eastern medicine, often leading to accidental catching of vaquitas. As the article correctly noted, it is the totoaba fish, not the vaquita. SPORTS A report in the Extra Bases column on Sunday about Cincinnati Reds pitcher Amir Garrett misidentified the Class A team for which he played in 2014. It was Dayton \u2014 not Daytona, which he played for in 2015. WEEKEND A children\u2019s entry in the Listings pages on Friday about Arbor Weekend, at the Wave Hill garden in the Bronx, misstated the date of a cooking demonstration that will use juniper. It is today, not Sunday. \u2022 An article on Friday about the art dealer Bridget Donahue misstated the surname of her gallery associate. She is Erin Leland, not Somerville. The article also misidentified the artist who is traveling to Cologne with Ms. Donahue. She is Monique Mouton, not Martine Syms. OBITUARIES An obituary on Thursday about Agust\u00edn Edwards, the publisher of the conservative Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, referred incorrectly to a previous owner of that newspaper, Agust\u00edn Edwards MacClure. He was Mr. Edwards\u2019s grandfather, not his great-grandfather, and he founded the Santiago edition of El Mercurio in 1900 \u2014 not the newspaper itself, which was founded in Valparaiso in 1827. \u2022 An obituary on Thursday about the former New York City judge Dennis Edwards Jr. referred imprecisely to Washington Square College, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1941. It was the Manhattan undergraduate school of New York University; it was not N.Y.U.\u2019s only undergraduate school. (The university also had a campus in the Bronx at the time.)
