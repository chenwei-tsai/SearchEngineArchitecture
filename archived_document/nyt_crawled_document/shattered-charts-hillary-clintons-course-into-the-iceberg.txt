Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton in November came as a shock to the world. Polls, news reports and everything the Clinton campaign was hearing in the final days pointed to her becoming the first female president in American history. In their compelling new book, \u201cShattered,\u201d the journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes write that Clinton\u2019s loss suddenly made sense of all the reporting they had been doing for a year and a half \u2014 reporting that had turned up all sorts of \u201cforeboding signs\u201d that often seemed at odds, in real time, with indications that Clinton was the favorite to win. Although the Clinton campaign was widely covered, and many autopsies have been conducted in the last several months, the blow-by-blow details in \u201cShattered\u201d \u2014 and the observations made here by campaign and Democratic Party insiders \u2014 are nothing less than devastating, sure to dismay not just her supporters but also everyone who cares about the outcome and momentous consequences of the election. In fact, the portrait of the Clinton campaign that emerges from these pages is that of a Titanic-like disaster: an epic fail made up of a series of perverse and often avoidable missteps by an out-of-touch candidate and her strife-ridden staff that turned \u201ca winnable race\u201d into \u201canother iceberg-seeking campaign ship.\u201d It\u2019s the story of a wildly dysfunctional and \u201cspirit-crushing\u201d campaign that embraced a flawed strategy (based on flawed data) and that failed, repeatedly, to correct course. A passive-aggressive campaign that neglected to act on warning flares sent up by Democratic operatives on the ground in crucial swing states, and that ignored the advice of the candidate\u2019s husband, former President Bill Clinton, and other Democratic Party elders, who argued that the campaign needed to work harder to persuade undecided and ambivalent voters (like working-class whites and millennials), instead of focusing so insistently on turning out core supporters. \u201cOur failure to reach out to white voters, like literally from the New Hampshire primary on, it never changed,\u201d one campaign official is quoted as saying. There was a perfect storm of other factors, of course, that contributed to Clinton\u2019s loss, including Russian meddling in the election to help elect Trump; the controversial decision by the F.B.I. director, James Comey, to send a letter to Congress about Clinton\u2019s emails less than two weeks before Election Day; and the global wave of populist discontent with the status quo (signaled earlier in the year by the British \u201cBrexit\u201d vote) that helped fuel the rise of both Trump and Bernie Sanders. In a recent interview, Clinton added that she believed \u201cmisogyny played a role\u201d in her loss. The authors of \u201cShattered,\u201d however, write that even some of her close friends and advisers think that Clinton \u201cbears the blame for her defeat,\u201d arguing that her actions before the campaign (setting up a private email server, becoming entangled in the Clinton Foundation, giving speeches to Wall Street banks) \u201chamstrung her own chances so badly that she couldn\u2019t recover,\u201d ensuring that she could not \u201ccast herself as anything but a lifelong insider when so much of the country had lost faith in its institutions.\u201d Allen and Parnes are the authors of a 2014 book, \u201cH R C,\u201d a largely sympathetic portrait of Clinton\u2019s years as secretary of state, and this book reflects their access to longtime residents of Clinton\u2019s circle. They interviewed more than a hundred sources on background \u2014 with the promise that none of the material they gathered would appear before the election \u2014 and while it\u2019s clear that some of these people are spinning blame retroactively, many are surprisingly candid about the frustrations they experienced during the campaign. \u201cShattered\u201d underscores Clinton\u2019s difficulty in articulating a rationale for her campaign (other than that she was not Donald Trump). And it suggests that a tendency to value loyalty over competence resulted in a lumbering, bureaucratic operation in which staff members were reluctant to speak truth to power, and competing tribes sowed \u201cconfusion, angst and infighting.\u201d Despite years of post-mortems, the authors observe, Clinton\u2019s management style hadn\u2019t really changed since her 2008 loss of the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama: Her team\u2019s convoluted power structure \u201cencouraged the denizens of Hillaryland to care more about their standing with her, or their future job opportunities, than getting her elected.\u201d The campaign frequently spun its wheels in response to crises and urgent appeals from Democrats on both the state and national levels, the authors report. Big speeches were written by committee. \u201cEvolving the core message\u201d remained a continuing struggle. And the Brooklyn campaign headquarters \u2014 which would end up outspending Trump\u2019s campaign by nearly 2 to 1 \u2014 frustrated coordinators in battleground states like Colorado by penny-pinching and cutting back on television, direct mail and digital advertising. As described in \u201cShattered,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook \u2014 who centered the Clinton operation on data analytics (information about voters, given to him by number crunchers) as opposed to more old-fashioned methods of polling, knocking on doors and trying to persuade undecideds \u2014 made one strategic mistake after another, but was kept on by Clinton, despite her own misgivings. \u201cMook had made the near-fatal mistakes of underestimating Sanders and investing almost nothing early in the back end of the primary calendar,\u201d Parnes and Allen write, and the campaign seemed to learn little from Clinton\u2019s early struggles. For instance, her loss in the Michigan primary in March highlighted the problems that would pursue her in the general election \u2014 populism was on the rise in the Rust Belt, and she was not connecting with working-class white voters \u2014 and yet it resulted in few palpable adjustments. Michigan, the authors add, also pointed up Mook\u2019s failure to put enough organizers on the ground, and revealed that his data was a little too rosy, \u201cmeaning the campaign didn\u2019t know Bernie was ahead.\u201d These problems were not corrected in the race against Trump. Allen and Parnes report that Donna Brazile, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, was worried in early October about the lack of ground forces in major swing states, and that Mook had \u201cdeclined to use pollsters to track voter preferences in the final three weeks of the campaign,\u201d despite pleas from advisers in crucial states. After a planned appearance in Green Bay with President Obama was postponed, the authors write, Clinton never set foot in Wisconsin, a key state. In fact, they suggest, the campaign tended to take battleground states like Wisconsin and Michigan (the very states that would help hand the presidency to Trump) for granted until it was too late, and instead looked at expanding the electoral map beyond Democratic-held turf and traditional swing states to places like Arizona. In chronicling these missteps, \u201cShattered\u201d creates a picture of a shockingly inept campaign hobbled by hubris and unforced errors, and haunted by a sense of self-pity and doom, summed up in one Clinton aide\u2019s mantra throughout the campaign: \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to have nice things.\u201d", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00"}
