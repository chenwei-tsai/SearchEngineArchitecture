{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here\u2019s the latest. 1. On his 99th day in office, President Trump received a thunderous welcome at a National Rifle Association conference in Atlanta. Mr. Trump also spoke to Reuters about his new job, saying: \u201cThis is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.\u201d What\u2019s it like to be a journalist covering President Trump? Eventful! Here are our reporters\u2019 recollections of the first 100 days. _____ 2. Congress approved a one-week spending bill to keep the government open. Republicans have not been able to pass any legislation of note so far, despite controlling both houses. Our correspondent called it \u201cone of the least productive opening acts by Congress in recent memory.\u201d _____ 3. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the United Nations Security Council that the U.S. was keeping \u201call options\u201d on the table regarding North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. He called for stiffer sanctions and demanded that the North dismantle the program before any talks begin. Hours later, North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile. Check back for updates on that developing story. _____ 4. The U.S. economy is off to a slow start this year. But don\u2019t panic about it. The G.D.P. was at a three-year low in the first quarter, upsetting expectations of a \u201cTrump bump.\u201d But our reporter says the numbers can be explained by several factors (including a warm winter and cautious consumers) and are not a sign that the economy is headed for a fall. _____ 5. Arkansas is done with its spate of executions for now, as one of its lethal injection drugs expires within days. The fourth prisoner in seven days was executed on Thursday night. Kenneth Williams jerked and convulsed in the moments as he died, provoking questions about the drugs used. _____ 6. Pope Francis was in Egypt, where he argued forcefully against acts of violence in the name of religion. Speaking at Al Azhar, one of the world\u2019s most influential centers of Islamic learning, he said religious leaders must \u201cunmask the violence that masquerades as purported sanctity.\u201d His visit comes at a critical time for Egypt, which has endured intensifying terrorist attacks and a crackdown by an authoritarian government. _____ 7. You may want to bookmark this next piece, a long read that includes 360 video. Our reporters in Germany spent months in the city of Weimar (population 65,000), which absorbed 900 refugees in a single year. The result is this five-part series that brings you inside people\u2019s homes as they try to rebuild their lives. _____ 8. The first round of the N.F.L. draft featured a few surprising selections. Defensive end Myles Garrett of Texas A&M, above, who went to the Cleveland Browns as the top overall pick, was seen as a sure thing. But Mitchell Trubisky, quarterback from North Carolina who went to the Chicago Bears, was called \u201ca franchise-ruining selection.\u201d Ouch. Our sportswriter is critical of the whole draft, calling it a \u201cmeat market\u201d where prospects are examined like Wagyu cattle. _____ 9. The 1992 Los Angeles riots started 25 years ago on Saturday, sparked by the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of a black taxi driver named Rodney King. Fifty people were killed in the unrest, and there was more than $1 billion in damage. Crime is down and much has changed, yet a recent poll found most Angelenos think another riot is likely in the next five years. \u201cWe\u2019re just one more little slap in the face away from another one,\u201d one resident said. _____ 10. What was supposed to be a luxe music festival on a private island turned into a truly stunning debacle. The inaugural Fyre Festival, founded by the rapper Ja-Rule, above, and the tech entrepreneur Billy McFarland, was set to feature performances from chart-topping artists, \u201cfirst-class culinary experiences\u201d and a V.I.P. crowd. Ticket packages reached six-figures for chartered yachts and private planes. But when guests arrived, the place basically looked like a parking lot. _____ 11. Finally, read how the other side thinks. In our latest installment of \u201cRight and Left: Partisan Writing You Shouldn\u2019t Miss,\u201d we consider the Hulu series \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d why the left should tolerate anti-abortion Democrats and why the media bubble is worse than you thought.
