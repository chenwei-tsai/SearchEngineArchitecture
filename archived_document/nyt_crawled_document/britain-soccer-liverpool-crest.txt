{"text": "The Liverpool Football Club on Thursday revealed a new jersey \u2014 and a new crest \u2014 for next season, when it will commemorate its 125th anniversary. The new design, which closely resembles the current one, was greeted with what amounted to benign acceptance from the team\u2019s fans. Given the alternative, that was probably a good thing. In soccer, altering or even the suggestion of altering, heritage-filled insignia is a perilous task. Changing iconic, and often beloved, emblems that are emblazoned on clothes and mugs, painted on city walls and even tattooed on bodies has become an almost certain way to cause rifts among fans and provoke outrage on social media, where criticism can be registered and amplified exponentially in an instant. Across Stanley Park in Liverpool, for example, Liverpool F.C.\u2019s neighbor, Everton, angered fans in 2013 when the club streamlined its logo and, in the process, removed a banner with its Latin motto, Nil Satis Nisi Optimum, or \u201cNothing but the best.\u201d Despite Everton\u2019s declaration that an in-house consultation that included fans had taken place, an online petition opposing the crest quickly collected the signatures of more than 6,000 aggrieved supporters. Too late to remove the unpopular logo for the coming season, Everton issued an apology, held meetings with fans, took surveys and, ultimately, held a vote on three potential alternatives. The Latin motto returned to the crest a year later, where it remains today. \u201cI think anything which is about their club is going to get interest from the fans and be emotive,\u201d said Richard Kenyon, whose marketing firm Kenyon Fraser worked on the second rebrand with Everton. He later became the club\u2019s director of marketing and communications. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that any process like this brings the fans along with it.\u201d For those recently tasked with reshaping Liverpool\u2019s famous jersey crest and club badge, there were plenty of historic \u2014 and revered \u2014 elements to be considered: the liver bird, a mythical creature symbolic of the city; an image of twin flames, an early 1990s addition that pays tribute to the victims of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster that left 96 trampled or crushed to death at a Football Association Challenge cup game at Sheffield; and the Shankly Gates, a homage to Bill Shankly, widely considered the team\u2019s greatest manager, on which are stamped the words to the club\u2019s anthem, \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.\u201d Tampering with any of them, as at least one sponsor has done recently, can lead to a public relations disaster. In the end, the new Liverpool design featured few changes: the team\u2019s jerseys will continue to feature a golden liver bird with \u201c125 Years\u201d beneath it and the dates 1872 and 2017 on either side. The badge itself will not be altered, except to add type denoting the years and the 125th anniversary. But Latin mottos and eternal flames are only two of the often decades-old elements that designers must consider in any rebranding. Many European clubs started out as just that, and so the features that adorned their crests \u2014 coats of arms and animals, weapons and tools, local landmarks and significant dates \u2014 often had little to do with concepts like revenue generation and marketing appeal. \u201cIt used to be that badges got tweaked over the years because, say, a new owner or someone would come in and go, \u2018My view is that we stand for these things, so let\u2019s add something else here,\u2019\u201d said Matt House, the chief executive officer for SportQuake, a British sports marketing agency. \u201cToday, the majority of badge changes are purely commercially driven.\u201d Wholesale changes are rarely popular. When the Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan took over Cardiff City in 2010, he pledged to invest tens of millions of dollars if the Bluebirds switched their primary color to red, Tan\u2019s lucky color and one that might increase business opportunities in Asia, where it has symbolic value. The alterations went ahead in 2012, only for the team to revert to blue three years later after public protests. In January, the Italian team Juventus raised eyebrows when it revealed a minimalist logo that the club said it hoped would extend beyond soccer and into a lifestyle brand. Design professionals loved it. Fans? Not so much. A similar approach did not work for London\u2019s Queen Park Rangers, whose previous owners were perceived to have fumbled a rebrand ahead of the 2008 season. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really understand the club and were trying to stamp their own feel on it,\u201d said Daniel Norris, a graphic designer and Q.P.R. fan. He declared the first effort \u201ca bit of a mess,\u201d even to an amateur eye. After the current chairman, Tony Fernandes, took over Q.P.R. in 2011, Norris and a fellow designer, Daniel Bowyer, used social media as a means of engaging fans to achieve the change they desired. They put out suggestions for possible new crests, worked closely with the club\u2019s in-house designers, and pushed for a professional typographer to be hired, Norris said. A modernized version of the previous logo was released ahead of the current season. That more transparent approach, Norris said, can lead to a positive outcome. It has allowed fans to understand Real Madrid\u2019s decision to remove the Christian cross from its logo on clothing sold in the Middle East, and it eased the recent introduction of redrawn logos for the teams at Manchester City and West Ham. House, the sports marketing executive, pointed to Arsenal\u2019s rebranding in 2002 as a watershed that, despite initial questions, protected the club against counterfeit and copyright issues. Arsenal also modernized the team\u2019s image for an age in which badges need to be clean, compact and able to work as well on huge banners as they did in tiny digital formats. So at Arsenal, out went the local Borough of Islington\u2019s coat of arms and a highly detailed script and cannon, and in came a sleeker typeface and cannon \u2014 now facing in the other direction. But there is no substitute for timing, either, as Aston Villa discovered last season. Having chosen a straightforward cleanup of its logo \u2014 a move that saw the motto \u201cPrepared\u201d removed in order to make the main feature, a lion, more prominent \u2014 the redesign was released as Villa faced the devastating prospect of relegation from the Premier League. Chris Wormell, a professional wood engraver who was asked to design a more fierce lion, said fans seemed to like his version. But the team\u2019s troubles at the time and news media reports fueled fan anger at the idea the club was spending money on a rebranding as it fought for its Premier League life. \u201cThere is always going to be a backlash,\u201d said Paul Stafford, co-founder and chief executive officer of DesignStudio, the agency that led the Premier League\u2019s rebranding last year. \u201cPeople, they love brands. And when it comes to football, you can times that by 10.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/soccer/britain-soccer-liverpool-crest.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T12:16:13-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T12:16:13-04:00", "abstract": "Even the smallest changes in a team\u2019s designs can cause rifts with fans, which often multiply when shared on social media.", "title": "In British Soccer, Teams Change Logos at Their Peril"}
