You can stream it here. \u25a0 There is a near-consensus No. 1 overall talent in Myles Garrett, a defensive end from Texas A&M with a freakish combination of size, speed and agility. The only uncertainty is the fact that the Cleveland Browns, owners of the first pick, may have their eyes on other talent. Whether they would consider choosing a quarterback, like North Carolina\u2019s Mitchell Trubisky, with the top pick, or try to trade down with a team looking to snag Garrett, is the first big question of the night. \u25a0 Few can agree on who the second-best prospect in this draft class is, but there are plenty of teams who could benefit from adding Alabama\u2019s Jonathan Allen, Louisiana State\u2019s Jamal Adams or Stanford\u2019s Solomon Thomas. Each player fills a rather specific niche, which could lead to a lot of trade activity in the first 10 picks. \u25a0 Running backs, who had long fallen out of favor in the draft, got a huge boost from the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 success with Ezekiel Elliott as the No. 4 pick last year. Elliott\u2019s success was not just a result of his immense talent, but also a perfect situation running behind a superb offensive line. But Louisiana State\u2019s Leonard Fournette will still likely benefit from Elliott\u2019s big season by going several picks higher than he would have in the past. \u25a0 Most N.F.L. teams do not have a strong reputation for factoring in character in the draft, but several players have had off-the-field incidents that will affect where they will be picked. Alabama\u2019s Reuben Foster, formerly a potential top-three pick, may fall to the end of the first round thanks to an altercation with a hospital worker and a diluted drug sample. Oklahoma\u2019s Joe Mixon, who undoubtedly was hoping to cash in on the same Elliott Bump as Fournette, is now expected to be a middle-round pick because of a violent incident with a woman. Ohio State\u2019s Gareon Conley, a first-round talent, may go undrafted after being accused of a sexual assault earlier this month. He has not been arrested or charged. All languages evolve, of course, but few have spread as quickly as draftspeak, a growing dialect of American sport. It is used exclusively to evaluate athletes, often with dollops of flair and no hint of irony, and is most commonly spoken and heard in the lead-up to the N.F.L. draft, which begins on Thursday. It looks like English but sounds like gibberish, at least to the uninitiated. Mostly, it is made up of straight-faced jargon and biological terms connected by adjectives and action verbs.
