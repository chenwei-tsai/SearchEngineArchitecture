The tent, set up for the March for Science in Washington on Saturday by the Wick Poetry Center at Kent State University, was wallpapered inside and out with poems about the natural world by such writers as Gary Snyder and Kazim Ali. Ms. Roberts was one of several poets from Washington volunteering that day, and her lesson had drawn amateur poets of all ages. Ryder Gee, 5, had written \u201cAnt\u201d: \u201cBig black ant. Crawling on the porch. Crawling near my foot.\u201d His brother Jordan Gee, 9, had written a poem about a worm enjoying a lunch of \u201cnutritious dirt.\u201d The boys want to be scientists when they grow up, said their mother, Christina Gee, a psychology professor at George Washington University. Ms. Roberts had provided the class with a handout titled \u201cPoems on Phylum Arthropoda,\u201d which included \u201cCarpenter Bee\u201d by Natasha Tretheway and \u201cOde to the Maggot\u201d by Yusef Komunyakaa. Near the tent, Brenda Cooper, a science fiction writer, and Michelle Lighton, an archaeologist, had taken shelter from the rain under some trees. Ms. Cooper\u2019s sign, given to her by a friend, gave a shout out to George Orwell, Octavia Butler and Margaret Atwood. Science fiction has the power to bring science home to readers, to \u201cmake it visceral, make people feel it, make people cry about it,\u201d Ms. Cooper said. \u201cMany times science fiction has served as a warning.\u201d For Ms. Lighton, it had been an inspiration. \u201cI\u2019m a scientist because of science fiction,\u201d she said. \u201cScience fiction helped define a better world.\u201d \u201cScience is hope,\u201d she added. \u201cOur chance at a better future and a better life for everyone ultimately comes from science.\u201d She had never been to a march before, but had skipped a conference and flown from San Diego to attend the event on Saturday. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m marching for 2 + 2 = 4 is just the most bizarre thing in the world to me,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s something that\u2019s so important.\u201d Ms. Cooper was concerned about the future of the environment. \u201cIf we step backwards in climate,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ll die.\u201d The march was officially nonpartisan, and many attendees carried signs reading \u201cNo Sides in Science.\u201d But there were messages of power and defiance too \u2014 one sign read \u201cOceans are rising and so are we.\u201d One of the poems in Ms. Roberts\u2019s handout, \u201cAdvice from a Caterpillar\u201d by Amy Gerstler, felt like it could serve as a manual for resistance, or at least for survival. \u201cBehave cryptically to confuse predators,\u201d it read: \u201cchange colors, spit, or feign death. If all else fails, taste terrible.\u201d"}
