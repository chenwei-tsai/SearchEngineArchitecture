{"text": "From the drab 1995 cyberthriller \u201cThe Net\u201d onward, mainstream American movies have been hard-pressed to pertinently weigh in on the internet and its discontents. Yes, comedies are regularly larded with \u201cold folks can\u2019t tweet\u201d and \u201cthese darn kids and their \u2018texting\u2019\u201d jokes, while espionage thrillers invariably serve up hot webcam action. But few pictures attempt to take a hard look at what it all means \u2014 perhaps because the entertainment business has some resentment about its digital usurpation. So credit \u201cThe Circle\u201d with ambition, at least. This film, directed by James Ponsoldt, is an adaptation of Dave Eggers\u2019s 2014 novel, and the two collaborated on the screenplay. Mr. Eggers\u2019s book is both a satire and a cautionary tale, grafting surveillance-state mechanisms to a faux-progressive vision with pronounced cult leanings \u2014 a lot of its \u201cjoin us\u201d vibe feels passed down from Philip Kaufman\u2019s 1978 version of \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d a tale set, like the one here, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Mr. Ponsoldt\u2019s movie begins with its heroine, Mae (Emma Watson), trapped in a stale cubicle doing meaningless dunning labor for a meaningless company; in due time, she\u2019s doing much more high-tech \u201ccustomer experience\u201d work at the Circle, an internet service that seems to meld all the most annoying features of Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it. Adding to the forced-extroversion fun is a new invention, a multipurpose webcam that\u2019s the relative size and shape of an eyeball. \u201cKnowing is good but knowing everything is better,\u201d crows one of the company\u2019s principals, a Steve Jobs-like visionary named Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks). That maxim also appears in the novel, and it sticks in the craw, not least because any first-year graduate student in philosophy could demolish it. At what point did the Circle put a hiring freeze on anyone conversant with epistemology? Lampooning the simple-mindedness of utopian web clich\u00e9s was arguably part of Mr. Eggers\u2019s point, but much of that point is often muddled in the book. And it\u2019s simply incoherent in the movie. The novel is at its most trenchantly funny when depicting the exhausting nature of virtual social life, and it\u2019s in this area, too, that the movie gets its very few knowing laughs. But it\u2019s plain, not much more than 15 minutes in, that without the story\u2019s paranoid aspects you\u2019re left with a conceptual framework that\u2019s been lapped three times over by the likes of, say, the Joshua Cohen novel \u201cBook of Numbers,\u201d or the HBO comedy series \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d You\u2019re also left with oodles and oodles of bad acting and bad dialogue. Ms. Watson has to spend way too much time looking concerned while staring at various screens. Ellar Coltrane, who was so unaffectedly appealing as he grew up onscreen in Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cBoyhood,\u201d can\u2019t find any footing in the role of Mae\u2019s Mr. Integrity ex-boyfriend. It doesn\u2019t help that he has to mouth lines like \u201cWe used to go on adventures and have fun and see things, and you were brave and exciting.\u201d Mr. Hanks evokes an idea of avuncular visionary charm, and doesn\u2019t have much to do beyond that. And John Boyega \u2014 playing a character who was vital in the book but whose role has been reconfigured so that his function in the movie makes no sense \u2014 mostly stands around at the rear of auditoriums, backlit, and when called upon to speak does a very creditable Denzel Washington impersonation. The movie is dedicated to Bill Paxton, who died in February and is quite fine in the small role of Mae\u2019s father, who\u2019s dealing with multiple sclerosis. The dedication is a kind and considerate touch. Still, if you\u2019d like to enjoy a movie featuring both Mr. Paxton and Mr. Hanks, I\u2019d recommend \u201cApollo 13.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/the-circle-review-emma-watson-tom-hanks.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:54:04-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:54:04-04:00", "abstract": "Emma Watson and Tom Hanks star in this adaptation of a Dave Eggers novel that explores surveillance-state threats.", "title": "Review: In \u2018The Circle,\u2019 Click Here if You Think You\u2019re Being Watched"}
