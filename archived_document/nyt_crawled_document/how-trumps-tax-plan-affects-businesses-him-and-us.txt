{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cTrump\u2019s Plan Brings Moment of Truth for G.O.P. Deficit Hawks\u201d (front page, April 27): The miracle elixir of dramatically cutting taxes while increasing tax revenues through its promised rejuvenating effect on the economy is being peddled yet again. This tonic has been marketed with many different labels over the decades, including supply-side economics, the Laffer curve and Reaganomics. The latest concoction presented by President Trump is being touted as \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d of tax revenue. Well, it didn\u2019t work as advertised under Presidents Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush, and most recently had unfortunate side effects, including a lethargic economy and a ballooning state deficit, when tried in Kansas by its Tea Party governor. It received its iconic truth-in-advertising label from George H. W. Bush more than three decades ago when he ridiculed it as \u201cvoodoo economics.\u201d RUSS WEISSPRINCETON JUNCTION, N.J. To the Editor: My wife and I traveled to Las Vegas last weekend, and both of us were struck by the enormous gold tower with the bold letters \u201cTRUMP\u201d at the top. With the news of President Trump\u2019s tax reform plan, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how it would benefit the Trump Organization. With that tower lingering in my mind, I hope that every decision made by this president will be analyzed based on this question: How will this decision benefit Donald Trump, his family and his corporation? PAUL GINOCCHIOWALNUT CREEK, CALIF. To the Editor: Liberals shouldn\u2019t automatically oppose cutting the marginal corporate tax rate, currently 35 percent. Most large corporations don\u2019t pay this rate anyhow. I favor a reduction in the marginal corporate tax rate to 20 percent \u2014 and further reductions for creating jobs \u2014 as long as it is accompanied by the elimination of all loopholes and dodges, an increase in the personal income tax rate for high earners and a progressive wealth tax. Cutting the corporate tax rate would help small business, stimulate the economy and add domestic jobs. STUART DUNN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Deficit hawk: A term of art referring to politicians who promote deficit fearmongering while 1) noticing the budgets only of Democratic presidents and 2) using magical thinking to ignore deficits created by Republicans who propose to give away the Treasury to the superrich. Usage tip: The terms \u201cdeficit hawk\u201d and \u201ctruth\u201d are not commonly used in the same sentence. MITCHELL ZIMMERMANPALO ALTO, CALIF. To the Editor: Re \u201cWhite House Tax Plan Puts Business at the Fore\u201d (front page, April 26): Congress should maintain one of the mainstays of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986: Tax small-business income and capital gains at the same rates as ordinary income like wages. It is inherently unfair to average wage-earning Americans for individuals who receive small-business income or capital gains to pay taxes at lower rates. In fact, many so-called \u201csmall businesses\u201d are partnerships that serve merely as investment vehicles for their owners. Despite some rhetoric to the contrary, lower rates on capital gains and small-business income are not required for individuals to invest in new businesses. Under Mr. Reagan\u2019s 1986 tax act, similar investments did not come to a halt. Having different tax rates for various sources of income will result in income tax \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d For example, even under current law many individuals create corporate entities to receive their consulting income. Why should such consulting income be taxed at lower rates? Taxes should be fair. DAVID NELSON, HOUSTON The writer is a former tax partner at Ernst & Young. To the Editor: If Donald Trump the candidate had any intention of keeping his campaign promise of providing more jobs, then Donald Trump the president would not propose lowering corporate taxes but would propose using part of revenues gained from corporations to create job-training programs. No doubt there is some pro-business, supply-side rationale saying lower taxes will help keep corporations and jobs in the United States. But as corporations gain more money and power in America, I have seen little evidence that they become more altruistic or concerned about their employees or their customers.
