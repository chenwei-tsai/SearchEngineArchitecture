Murphy, a former Mets second baseman who now plays for the Nationals, belted a grand slam off Zack Wheeler in the first inning to give Washington the lead before many Mets fans had found their seats. The home run was Murphy\u2019s third of the season \u2014 and his eighth against the Mets as a National. It powered Washington to a 6-3 win, completing a three-game sweep of the Mets, and sending them to their eighth loss in nine games. (They are 1-5 on their nine-game homestand.) At 8-11 over all, the Mets also fell to five and a half games behind the Nationals in the National League East. \u201cNobody\u2019s freaking out in here,\u201d said Neil Walker, Murphy\u2019s replacement with the Mets. \u201cPeople may be freaking outside of here, but that\u2019s not any of our concern. Our concern is winning ballgames.\u201d The home fans did not need more incentive to dislike Murphy, whose explosive 2015 postseason powered the Mets to the World Series \u2014 and hastened his departure from Flushing. Murphy has not been popular here since he signed a three-year, $37.5 million free-agent contract with the Nationals the following off-season. Never mind that the Mets had made it clear that they were not going to bid for his services, even as he led them to the World Series by batting .529 with four home runs in their N.L. Championship Series sweep of the Chicago Cubs. He is now the enemy. Besides, Murphy made a costly error in Game 4 of the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, which gave Mets management a reason not to spend what it would have cost to keep him. Mets fans have treated him as a dangerous interloper at Citi Field ever since, with good reason. Murphy now has 25 R.B.I. in 22 games against the Mets. In Friday night\u2019s game, Murphy went hitless for the first time against the Mets, but he wasted little time in working his way back to the top of the Mets fans\u2019 enemies list Sunday night. After Wheeler hit the leadoff batter Adam Eaton and then surrendered an infield hit to Trea Turner and a clean single to Bryce Harper, Murphy bashed a 96-mile-per-hour fastball over the right-center field fence. The grand slam, the second of Murphy\u2019s career, raised his batting average against the Mets to .400. The Mets held Murphy in check the rest of the game \u2014 Wheeler struck him out and got him to fly out before leaving after seven innings \u2014 but a two-run home run by Ryan Zimmerman in the eighth off Josh Smoker completed the Nationals\u2019 scoring. The Mets had cut the lead to 4-3 on a first-inning solo home run by Michael Conforto and a two-run homer by Walker in the third, but they could manage only one more hit, a fifth-inning Conforto single, off Max Scherzer, who worked eight innings and struck out nine. But the real damage had already been done. The team that lives by the home run would, on this night, die by it \u2014 courtesy of a former Met turned Mets-killer. Inside Pitch Manager Terry Collins said for the first time that Yoenis Cespedes, out since Thursday with a \u201chamstring cramp,\u201d could be headed to the disabled list if the injury does not significantly improve after Monday\u2019s day off. \u201cIf Tuesday comes and he\u2019s not much better,\u201d Collins said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to take a look at that.\u201d", "abstract": "Murphy continued to torture his former team, as his homer off Zack Wheeler gave Washington all the runs it needed to complete a three-game sweep at Citi Field."}
