Between its debut in 2012 and its finale last Sunday, according to some exhaustive data journalism from The Awl, The New York Times published 37 articles about the show, its fans, its creator and star, Lena Dunham, plus her co-stars\u2019 clothes and paintings and workout routines and exotic pets. Except, fact-check: I made up the exotic pets, and The Awl\u2019s list unaccountably failed to include my own contribution to The Times\u2019s Dunham-mania, a love letter to the show\u2019s flirtations with cultural reaction. Was some of this coverage excessive? Well, let\u2019s concede that the ratio of thinkpieces (all over the web, not just in this newspaper) to actual viewers was considerably higher for \u201cGirls\u201d than for, say, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Let\u2019s concede that the media loved to talk about the show in part because it was set among young white people in Brooklyn, a demographic just possibly overrepresented among the people who write about pop culture for a living. Let\u2019s concede that Dunham\u2019s peculiar role in electoral politics, as one of the most visible and, um, creative millennial-generation surrogates for Barack Obama and then Hillary Clinton, played some role in the press\u2019s fascination with her show. But now that we have the show in full, I think the scale of coverage actually holds up quite well \u2014 my own small part in it very much included. Indeed, I suspect that \u201cGirls\u201d will be remembered as the most interesting and important television show of the years in which it ran, to which cultural critics will inevitably return when they argue about art and society in the now-vanished era of Obama. Of course there are different kinds of cultural importance. Because its audience was small and its characters difficult and unpleasant and its material sometimes weird and often gross, \u201cGirls\u201d didn\u2019t have (and didn\u2019t seek) the kind of aspirational influence achieved by its young-hip-bedhopping-urbanite predecessors \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cFriends.\u201d Nor did it inspire the obsessive viewer love and endless imitators of Golden Age of Television\u2122 dramas like \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cMad Men.\u201d It was a niche taste with a niche audience; nothing substantial in American culture or the television industry was altered by its episodic story. But it was the equal of the prestige dramas and superior to \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cSex in the City\u201d as a scripted-acted-shot achievement, and reliably funnier (in a wince-inducing way) than any of them. . And as a mirror held up to American culture, it showed something very different than its prestige-TV peers, something equally important and arguably more forward-looking and distinctive. The typical prestige drama, from \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d onward, has been a portrait of patriarchy in extremis, featuring embattled male antiheroes struggling to maintain their authority in a changing world or a collapsing culture. Usually these stories are set somewhere Out There, in landscapes alien to the typical liberal-ish prestige-TV viewer: In flyover country, in copland and gangland, in George R.R. Martin\u2019s Westeros, among Mormon polygamists, on Madison Avenue in the last days of the WASPs. Tony Soprano pining for the days of Gary Cooper set a tone for all these stories, which then echoed and re-echoed in the Louisiana swamps of \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d the New Mexican borderlands of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the halls of Sterling Cooper Draper Price. Again and again the viewer watched a male protagonist trying to be a breadwinner, paterfamilias, a protector and savior, a Leader of Men; again and again these attempts were presented as dangerously alluring, corrupting, untimely and foredoomed. In certain ways the medieval arc of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 in which the noble-but-na\u00efve patriarchy of Ned Stark gives way to the toxic patriarchy of warring kings, with Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons waiting to sweep it all away \u2014 distilled the whole prestige-drama project to its fundamental archetypes: nostalgia for male kingship, fear of bad kings, a certain satisfaction at the patriarchy\u2019s inevitable fall. On \u201cGirls,\u201d though, something very different was going on. The fall of patriarchy had basically happened, the world had irrevocably changed \u2026 and nobody knew what to do next. This (and many other things) distinguished the show\u2019s storytelling from the superficially similar \u201cSex and the City,\u201d in which the remains of the patriarchy still provided a kind of narrative order. In theory the women of \u201cSex\u201d prized their freedom and their friendship more than men \u2014 but they were also oppressed by and obsessed with toxic bachelors, they still pined for Mr. Big, and they ultimately settled down with decent working-class guys or gorgeous male models or nice Jewish lawyers or Big himself. But \u201cGirls\u201d was a show in which any kind of confident male authority or presence was simply gone, among most of the older characters as well as among the millennial protagonists. The show\u2019s four girls had mostly absent fathers (the only involved and caring one came out as gay midway through the show) and few Don Draper-esque bosses to contend with. The toxic bachelors they dated were more pathetic than threatening, and the \u201csensitive\u201d guys still more so; even the most intense relationships they formed were semi-pathological. A few men on the show (the oldest of the younger characters, most notably) exhibited moral decency and some sort of idealism, a few were genuinely sinister \u2014 but mostly the male sex seemed adrift, permanently boyish, a bundle of hormonal impulses leagues away from any kind of serious and potent manhood. Meanwhile the girls themselves were all, to varying degrees, antiheroic: as self-destructive and narcissistic in their way as the embattled patriarchs familiar from other HBO productions. (Though, yes, rather less murderous.) From the beginning, the unattractiveness of their behavior inspired some queasy responses to the show from liberal and feminist critics, and some celebratory rejoinders about how the freedom to make a mess \u2014 sexually and otherwise \u2014 is the central freedom that feminism sought to win. Probably the latter interpretation was closer to the showrunners\u2019 conscious intent. But successful art has a way of slipping its ideological leash, and the striking thing about \u201cGirls\u201d is how the mess it portrayed made a mockery of the official narrative of social liberalism, in which prophylactics and graduate degrees and gender equality are supposed to lead smoothly to health, wealth and high-functioning relationships. In large ways and small the show deconstructed those assumptions. The characters\u2019 sex lives were not remotely \u201csafe\u201d; they were porn-haunted and self-destructive, a mess of S.T.D. fears and dubiously consensual incidents and sudden marriages and stupid infidelities. (Abortion was sort-of normalized but also linked to narcissism: The only character to actually have an abortion was extraordinarily blas\u00e9 about it, and then over subsequent episodes revealed as a monster of self-involvement.) Meanwhile the professional world was mostly a series of dead ends and failed experiments, and the idea that sisterhood would conquer all even if relationships with men didn\u2019t work out dissolved as the show continued and its core foursome gradually came apart. Real adulthood did await for Dunham\u2019s character, Hannah Horvath, at the show\u2019s conclusion. But the form it took was almost too heavy-handed in its traditionalist definition of a woman\u2019s growing-up: an unplanned pregnancy, a baby, the absolute obligations of motherhood trumping the trivialities of freedom. True, this was motherhood solo, without a mate or male provider. But the male absence felt more like a signifier of masculine failure than feminine empowerment: After a lecture from an older gay man about how large a father\u2019s absence can loom, Hannah tried to involve the father in the baby\u2019s life, and he ducked out pathetically; the offers from other men to help raise the child dissolved, and what remained as the show ends was a kind of informal and fractious matriarchy \u2014 Hannah and a friend and her mother off Upstate with her infant son, like a tribe of refugees waiting for civilization to reform. Of course the real-life civilization they are part of just elected Donald Trump as president, making all those prestige-drama portraits of toxic patriarchy seem quite relevant to our circumstances again, and the travails of life under social liberalism a little less immediately pressing. But the wheel will turn again, and the relevance of \u201cGirls\u201d will wax as it does. There are many ways to capture our society\u2019s complicated reality; the urban white liberal Brooklynite milieu is indeed, as the show\u2019s haters always stood ready to remind us, a pretty narrow slice of American and Western life. But then again so is the New Jersey mafia or Madison Avenue in its heyday or the Albuquerque drug trade. If those slices, in their different ways, embody the allure and pathologies of old-school male power, the slice that \u201cGirls\u201d portrayed (with, yes, caricature as well as realism) embodies a stronghold of the egalitarian alternative that cultural liberalism aspires to spread to everyone. And the genius, and resonance, and staying power of Lena Dunham\u2019s show rests not only on its artistic quality but on its message to its mostly liberal viewers: You do not have this alternative figured out.", "item_type": "Article"}
