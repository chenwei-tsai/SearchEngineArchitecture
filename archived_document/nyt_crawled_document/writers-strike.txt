{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Screenwriters and entertainment companies held contract talks in the final hours before a strike deadline on Monday, as union loyalists flooded Twitter with messages of resolve and as the rest of Hollywood held its collective breath. As of midafternoon, negotiators for the Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, were still meeting with their studio counterparts. Studios had made a new offer on Sunday \u2014 one reflecting improvements in some areas (health care) and scant movement in others (raises for Netflix and Amazon Prime shows) \u2014 and the unions came back Monday with a counteroffer, according to three people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings. These people said the unions\u2019 latest proposals varied little from previous ones. The writers\u2019 contract expires at midnight Pacific Daylight Time on Monday. The unions and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, have declined to comment on the state of negotiations while adhering to a news media blackout. But union members, including one involved with talks, posted messages on Twitter using the hashtag #wgaunity. Some fans and members of other Hollywood unions joined them. \u201cOur demands remain reasonable, affordable and fair,\u201d wrote Billy Ray, a member of his union\u2019s negotiating committee whose credits include the Tom Hanks movie \u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d and the coming Amazon series \u201cThe Last Tycoon.\u201d Eileen Conn, whose credits include the Disney Channel series \u201cK. C. Undercover\u201d and the 1990s sitcom \u201cJust Shoot Me,\u201d posted a photo of Sally Field as the title character from the film \u201cNorma Rae\u201d and wrote: \u201cWe are strong! We are united!\u201d Writers last month voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike; 6,310 ballots were cast, representing 68 percent of eligible voters, with 96 percent in favor of a walkout if no palatable deal was offered by studios. Some guild members were expected to gather on Monday night to make more placards to carry outside eight Los Angeles-area studios as soon as Tuesday morning. A strike would pit union writers, whose position has been eroded by reality television, the rise of lower-paying streaming networks and reduced output by major movie studios, against entertainment conglomerates like Comcast, the Walt Disney Company and Time Warner. Television talk shows that rely on writers for monologues and skits \u2014 \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 would be affected first, followed by soap operas and some scripted summer series. In the last big Hollywood strike, a decade ago, an enraged Writers Guild walked out over pay for digitally distributed shows. Tens of thousands of entertainment workers were idled, and the action cost the Los Angeles economy more than $2 billion, according to the Milken Institute.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/business/media/writers-strike.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T20:39:55-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T20:39:55-04:00", "abstract": "The two branches of the Writers Guild of America met with entertainment companies before what could be the first big Hollywood labor walkout in a decade.", "title": "Screenwriters and Studios Negotiate in Hours Before Strike Deadline"}
