I actually dozed off for a moment while slogging through the boilerplate recitations from the mid-1950s: \u201cThis being the annual meeting of the Board following the adjourned annual meeting of the stockholders, the president then presented to the Board the following list of officers \u2014 \u201d Lights out. So the following candid paragraph, from the minutes of the stockholders\u2019 meeting of June 6, 1963, stands out like a newsboy on a streetcorner shouting \u201cExtra!\u201d into the night: Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg was the last surviving board member to have been at that meeting. Her death on April 19 was a reminder that the Ochs-Sulzberger family owned the liberal-leaning Chattanooga Times until 1999, when it was merged with its conservative rival, The News-Free Press. The Times and Free Press still maintain separate opinion sections. It was also a reminder that Chattanooga did not always look upon The Times or the Ochs-Sulzberger family as benevolent forces \u2014 especially in the \u201950s, as The Times began to espouse racial equality and desegregation. \u201cCommunist-infested New York\u201d was how The News-Free Press described the city where The Times\u2019s overlords held sway. In 1954, when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the racial segregation of public schools violated the Constitution, The Chattanooga Times looked beyond the South, where the decision was being bitterly denounced. \u201cInternationally, opinion will benefit this nation in a time of great crisis,\u201d the editorial said, \u201ccountering one of the most effective talking points of Communist propaganda.\u201d (No one liked Commies.) In 1955, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who was the publisher of The New York Times and Mrs. Holmberg\u2019s father, began prodding The Chattanooga Times to abandon its practice of segregating obituaries into white and \u201cColored\u201d sections. \u201cI don\u2019t think God is standing next to St. Peter to check the color of the spirits as they come through the gates,\u201d he said, according to an account in \u201cThe Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times,\u201d by Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones. (Between them, Mr. Sulzberger and his wife, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, controlled 1,801 of the 2,000 shares in the Times Printing Company, under the will of Adolph S. Ochs, who became publisher of The Chattanooga Times in 1878 and of The New York Times in 1896.) Mrs. Holmberg, who was then the assistant secretary and a director of the company, was in sympathy with her father\u2019s idea but resisted at first, according to \u201cThe Trust.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it will help the paper,\u201d she said. And she was right. \u201cEnraged whites threatened to boycott the paper\u2019s advertisers and The Chattanooga Times lost 3,000 subscribers,\u201d Ms. Tifft and Mr. Jones wrote. \u201cBut the new policy stuck. As the decade wore on, The Chattanooga Times emphasized \u2018gradualism\u2019 in the dismantling of segregation, while Arthur prodded the paper to echo the harder line of The New York Times.\u201d Mrs. Holmberg, then known as Mrs. Golden, became publisher of the Chattanooga Times in 1964. \u201cShe continued its pro-civil rights stance, a stance that didn\u2019t endear her to everyone here at the time,\u201d Clint Cooper, the Free Press editor of The Times Free Press, wrote on Friday. Why did she persist? Mr. Cooper borrowed Mrs. Holmberg\u2019s own words to answer: \u201cMy theory was things are right or they are wrong. And if they are wrong, they need to be looked at and made right.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T23:35:15-04:00", "abstract": "The death of Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg was a reminder of her family\u2019s years at the helm of The Chattanooga Times.
