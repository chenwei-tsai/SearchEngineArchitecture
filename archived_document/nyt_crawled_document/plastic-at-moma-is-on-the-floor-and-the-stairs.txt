{"abstract": "This live installation by Maria Hassabi features performers in poses that attract the curious and even gives security guards a role of sorts.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\u201cIs she real? Is she alive? Does she need help? Call 911. Is she breathing? Is she a sculpture? Is this art?\u201d The dancer Hristoula Harakas says she gets these comments all the time. They\u2019ve become a kind of background noise to her role in Maria Hassabi\u2019s \u201cPlastic,\u201d a live installation at the Museum of Modern Art through March 20. Walking around the museum, you can\u2019t miss \u201cPlastic\u201d and its slow progression through some of the building\u2019s most exposed spaces: the Marron Atrium, the main lobby staircase, and the stairs between the fourth- and fifth-floor galleries. At times you may need to step over what seems like a fallen body. And while plenty of people walk right by the dancers \u2014 regarding their shifting, sculptural poses with a hurried glance at most \u2014 the constellation of interactions between performers and the public has become a kind of artwork in itself. On a recent afternoon in the lounge-like atrium, one visitor lay down next to Ms. Harakas, posing for a photo. Another visitor, reclining on a nearby sofa, carried on a lengthy phone conversation, as if there were nothing to see. Others, camped out on ottomans and peering down from balconies, seemed unable to look away. \u201cIt was really important for me, while making the work, to keep thinking of the three-dimensionality,\u201d said Ms. Hassabi, who is one of 17 dancers, in a phone interview, \u201cto know there would be people everywhere around us, that people were going to ignore us, and that somewhere in there, somebody would stay and pay attention to us.\u201d Ms. Hassabi, who has choreographed for theaters, outdoor spaces and the risers of a Venice gymnasium, created \u201cPlastic\u201d at the invitation of the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, where it opened last year. It also had a short run at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Transitional spaces, like entrances and exits, caught her interest and aligned with her continuing exploration of stillness. The heavy traffic flow of the Modern, especially, inspired \u201ca desire to slow its rhythm down, even momentarily,\u201d she said in an email. In contexts where living, breathing art is not the norm, the attention paid to performers is not always positive. Ms. Harakas has been approached gently by visitors \u2014 someone touching her hand \u201cjust to see if I was alive\u201d \u2014 but also more aggressively: \u201cAt the Stedelijk, I had an old lady poke me with a cane \u2014 in a mean kind of way,\u201d she said. At the Modern, the busiest of the three institutions, the work has taken on a new dimension: the involvement of security guards, who direct traffic on the stairs and intervene in potentially injurious situations. Striking the right balance of performer well being and audience freedom has proved challenging. \u201cSome guards are very sensitive and so attentive,\u201d Ms. Hassabi said. \u201cThey are able to set the limits with the public in a very smooth way.\u201d With others, she noted, the experience is \u201cless enjoyable.\u201d The dancers look out for themselves, too, though that can be difficult when, say, lying upside down or face down on the stairs. Ms. Hassabi has asked at least one viewer to step away from her: \u201cHe said: \u2018Why? But you\u2019re art!\u2019 And I said: \u2018Exactly. You cannot be as close as you are to the art.\u2019\u201d Asked if she worried about her safety, the dancer Molly Lieber said no: \u201cPlastic\u201d leaves no room for distractions. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it with your whole body and your whole presence, you can\u2019t really do it,\u201d she said. One of the greatest breaches of audience etiquette, Ms. Hassabi said, comes from photographers with long-lens cameras, who appear to be doing professional work. As the dancer David Thomson put it, \u201cYou run into situations where someone has a camera, and you realize they\u2019re actually shooting a whole portfolio with you, and that\u2019s when it gets a little unnerving.\u201d \u201cPlastic\u201d is Mr. Thomson\u2019s fourth project as a performer at the Modern since 2010, when he took part in Marina Abramovic\u2019s retrospective, \u201cThe Artist Is Present.\u201d That show, featuring nude performers, raised critical questions about touching the art \u2014 when the art is human \u2014 and other issues specific to live performance. \u201cI think they\u2019ve grown immensely in how they deal with performers,\u201d Mr. Thomson said. \u201cThey have much more knowledgeable staff, who have done performance exhibitions, who understand the questions and the needs of the artists a lot more.\u201d Thomas J. Lax, a curator in the department of media and performance art and the chief organizer of \u201cPlastic,\u201d said coordinating performance had become a more museum-wide effort. Ms. Hassabi\u2019s installation, in particular, he said, calls for an institutional willingness to adapt. \u201cEven though we had dozens of meetings with our colleagues across the institution for over a year leading up to the exhibition, on Day 1 we regrouped and thought through all of the basic parameters we had set up,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the work didn\u2019t exist until that first person walked up the stairs and saw Maria lying there.\u201d In the first week of \u201cPlastic,\u201d Mr. Thomson performed a two-hour solo on one of the atrium sofas, using the time to connect with people around him \u2014 or to try to connect. \u201cSome people can\u2019t deal with eye contact; they don\u2019t want that kind of attention,\u201d he said. \u201cBut others really invite it, and when they do, I share that. Because part of my agency is to really engage someone, so that I\u2019m not just an inanimate object, but I\u2019m actually a real person, and I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d", "section": "Arts", "title": "\u2018Plastic,\u2019 at MoMA, Is on the Floor and the Stairs", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/arts/dance/plastic-at-moma-is-on-the-floor-and-the-stairs.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T07:00:10-04:00", "published_date": "2016-03-08T19:00:00-05:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T07:00:10-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
