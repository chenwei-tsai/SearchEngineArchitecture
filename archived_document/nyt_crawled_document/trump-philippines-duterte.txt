{"text": "MANILA \u2014 President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said on Monday that he might not accept President Trump\u2019s invitation to visit the White House, because he was \u201ctied up\u201d with a busy schedule. \u201cI cannot make any definite promise,\u201d Mr. Duterte said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to go to Russia, I\u2019m also supposed to go to Israel.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation on Saturday to Mr. Duterte, an authoritarian leader who has been accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug suspects, drew criticism from human rights advocates, who said such a visit would amount to a White House endorsement of his policies. Thousands of people have been gunned down in the Philippines since Mr. Duterte took office in June, promising a harsh crackdown on narcotics. Officials in the Trump administration said the president had called Mr. Duterte in an effort to mend the countries\u2019 recently strained relationship, as a bulwark against China\u2019s expansionism in the South China Sea. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump also wanted to build a united front in Asia in opposition to North Korea\u2019s pursuit of nuclear and missile technology. Mr. Duterte said his conversation with Mr. Trump had been amicable, and that he had urged him to tread carefully with North Korea. \u201cOur greatest chance there of getting some dialogue with America and North Korea would be through the intercession of China,\u201d he said. The Philippines and China have longstanding territorial disputes in the South China Sea, but Mr. Duterte has pivoted toward Beijing and away from Washington since taking office. He spoke to reporters on Monday after touring Chinese warships in port in Davao, his hometown, and said that the Philippines and China might hold joint naval exercises. Mr. Duterte, who once referred to Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, as a \u201cson of a whore,\u201d suggested on Monday that his differences with the United States had had much to do with Mr. Obama. \u201cIt was not a distancing, but it was rather a rift between me, maybe, and the State Department and Mr. Obama, who spoke openly against me,\u201d Mr. Duterte said. He added: \u201cThings have changed. There\u2019s a new leadership.\u201d Criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation to Mr. Duterte continued on Monday. \u201cCountries with close bilateral ties to the Philippines, particularly the United States, have an obligation to urge accountability for the victims of Duterte\u2019s abusive drug war, rather than offer to roll out the red carpet for official state visits with its mastermind,\u201d said Phelim Kine, a deputy director in Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/world/asia/trump-philippines-duterte.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T09:45:38-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T09:45:38-04:00", "abstract": "The Philippine leader, who is accused of ordering extrajudicial killings, has said he \u201ccannot make any definite promise\u201d to accept President Trump\u2019s invitation.", "title": "Rodrigo Duterte Says He May Be Too Busy for White House Visit"}
