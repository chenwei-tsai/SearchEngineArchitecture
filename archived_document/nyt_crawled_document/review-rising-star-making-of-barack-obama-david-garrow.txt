{"text": "RISING STARThe Making of Barack ObamaBy David J. Garrow1,460 pages. William Morrow. $45. \u201cRising Star,\u201d the voluminous 1,460-page biography of Barack Obama by David J. Garrow, is a dreary slog of a read: a bloated, tedious and \u2014 given its highly intemperate epilogue \u2014 ill-considered book that is in desperate need of editing, and way more exhausting than exhaustive. Many of the more revealing moments in this volume will be familiar to readers of Obama\u2019s own memoir, \u201cDreams From My Father\u201d; a host of earlier books about Obama and his family; and myriad profiles of the former president that have appeared in newspapers and magazines over the years. Garrow has turned up little that\u2019s substantially new \u2014 save for identifying and interviewing an old girlfriend from Obama\u2019s early Chicago years, who claims that by 1987, \u201che already had his sights on becoming president.\u201d In the absence of thoughtful analysis or a powerful narrative through line, Garrow\u2019s book settles for barraging the reader with a cascade of details \u2014 seemingly in hopes of creating a kind of pointillist picture. The problem is that all these data points never connect to form an illuminating portrait; the book does not open out to become the sort of resonant narrative that Robert A. Caro and Ron Chernow have pioneered, in which momentous historical events are deftly recreated, and a subject\u2019s life is situated in a time and a place. Instead, Garrow has expended a huge amount of energy \u2014 his bibliography, including interviews with more than a thousand people, runs to 35 pages \u2014 on giving us minutely detailed accounts of early chapters of Obama\u2019s life, like his years at Harvard Law School, his time in Chicago as a community organizer, and his work in the Illinois State Senate. Garrow gets to Obama\u2019s presidency only in an epilogue. While the Chicago chapter sheds valuable light on Obama\u2019s connection with black residents and his developing sense of vocation, many of the other sections that try to chronicle his day-to-day life feel extraneous and absurdly long-winded, as if Garrow wanted to include every last scrap of information he\u2019d unearthed. Are we really interested in what numerous Obama classmates, colleagues and passing acquaintances remember about his personality \u2014 that he struck them as cool or friendly, arrogant or voluble, cheerful or detached? Do we really want to read repetitious discussions about his cigarette consumption and poker-playing habits? Indeed, this entire book suffers from a poor sense of proportion. Garrow adds nothing to our understanding of Obama\u2019s intellectual evolution during his years at Columbia, or the role that the civil rights movement played in shaping his political consciousness and ideals. (Curious, given that Garrow, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987 for his book on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., \u201cBearing the Cross.\u201d) And yet Garrow prattles on for pages about legislation Obama worked on in the Illinois State Senate, and about discussions in law school classes he attended or taught. The entire first chapter of the book is devoted to examining the social and political landscape of Chicago\u2019s South Side in the early 1980s before Obama arrived to work there, but Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign and two terms in the White House are compressed into a 50-odd-page epilogue. Perhaps, as the title \u201cRising Star\u201d indicates, this book is meant to focus only on Obama\u2019s early years, but in that case, the epilogue \u2014 with the snarky title of \u201cThe President Did Not Attend, as He Was Golfing\u201d \u2014 seems even more inexplicable. Whereas the rest of the book is written in dry, largely uninflected prose, the epilogue \u2014 which almost reads like a Republican attack ad \u2014 devolves into a condescending diatribe unworthy of a serious historian. It consists mainly of a string of negative quotations about Obama\u2019s presidency and temperament, many plucked out of context from articles and books by journalists and commentators, or extracted from disillusioned former friends or supporters. There is no considered weighing of the record, no real recognition of the achievements of Obama\u2019s two terms in office (including his handling of the financial crisis that he inherited and passing Obamacare). Nor is there any useful explication of the policy decisions (like flip-flopping on Syria, and failing to close a deal enabling a sizable number of American forces to remain in Iraq beyond 2011) that have elicited sustained criticism from both government insiders and outside experts. Instead, Garrow\u2019s epilogue delivers a crude screed against Obama the president and Obama the man, filled with bald assertions and coy half-truths. He suggests that Obama\u2019s presidency was a long string of failures and disappointments and that \u201cbehind the scenes, many Democrats were just as eager for Barack to exit the White House as he himself now seemed,\u201d when, in fact, he left office as one of the most popular presidents in recent decades. Garrow takes Obama to task for his lack of \u201cbipartisan outreach\u201d with Republican members of Congress, but doesn\u2019t tell the other side of the story \u2014 namely, the Republicans\u2019 deliberate strategy of obstructionism throughout Obama\u2019s tenure in office. (The Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell famously declared, \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d) And, as the chapter title indicates, Garrow even mocks Obama, repeatedly, for spending too much time on the golf course. (What, one wonders, would he make of Donald J. Trump?) Then there is the innuendo. Garrow portentously cites a poll indicating that 64 percent of Republicans and 42 percent of whites agreed that it was \u201cprobably true\u201d that Obama was \u201chiding important information about his background and early life.\u201d This could be a reference to the birther movement, or perhaps to the bitter musings of Sheila Miyoshi Jager, the former girlfriend Obama had met in Chicago \u2014 who remained upset for years over their breakup, and whom Garrow has turned into one of his main sources. Jager is quoted as saying that \u201csomething changed\u201d in Obama \u201cafter we went our separate ways after Harvard, as if the part of him that was so vulnerable and open (and sensual?) went underground and something else \u2014 raging ambition, quest for greatness, whatever just took over instead.\u201d It\u2019s odd that Garrow should seize on one former lover\u2019s anger and hurt, and try to turn them into a Rosebud-like key to the former president\u2019s life, referring to her repeatedly in his epilogue. He even tries to turn her perception \u2014 about Obama\u2019s having willed himself into being \u2014 into a pejorative, when the act of self-invention, as other biographers have noted, was the enterprising and existential act of a young man who essentially had been abandoned by both his black father and white mother, and who found himself caught between cultures and trying, as he wrote in \u201cDreams,\u201d \u201cto raise myself to be a black man in America.\u201d Perhaps Garrow leans so heavily on Jager because she is a source mentioned only in passing (and not by name) in David Maraniss\u2019s \u201cBarack Obama: The Story\u201d (2012). It\u2019s telling, after all, that Garrow mischaracterizes the reception that both Maraniss\u2019s biography and David Remnick\u2019s incisive book \u201cThe Bridge\u201d received, suggesting that both volumes failed to get the accolades they did, in fact, receive. The reader interested in Barack Obama\u2019s life would do well to turn to those books, and not Garrow\u2019s overstuffed and ultimately unfair work here. Or, go back to Obama\u2019s own eloquent memoir.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/books/review-rising-star-making-of-barack-obama-david-garrow.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T17:36:13-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-05-01T17:36:13-04:00", "abstract": "David J.
