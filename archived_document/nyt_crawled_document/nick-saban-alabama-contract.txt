{"text": "Alabama is giving coach Nick Saban plenty of incentive to stick around \u2014 and to sign a contract extension in the first place. University trustees on Tuesday approved a three-year extension through the 2024 season that could pay Saban at least $65 million over the next eight years and again make him college football\u2019s highest-paid coach. Saban will make $11.125 million this year, counting a $4 million signing bonus and a $400,000 completion bonus. Michigan\u2019s Jim Harbaugh is making $7 million a year, including a $2 million annual life insurance premium. He made $9 million last year , when he received the insurance payouts in both June and December. The 65-year-old Saban, who has led Alabama to four national titles in the past seven seasons, said the extension ensures \u201cour time here in Tuscaloosa will continue for many more years.\u201d \u201cThis has become our home and we are looking forward to finishing our career at Alabama,\u201d he said in a statement. Saban, who won the 2013 B.C.S. title at Louisiana State, and Bear Bryant are the only coaches to win five national championships in the Associated Press poll era dating back to 1936. In January, Alabama lost to Clemson in the championship game after winning its fourth Southeastern Conference title in five years and third straight. Saban will get up to $7.2 million in annual completion bonuses, with half of that due after the 2021 season. His base salary and \u201ctalent fee\u201d will be $6.725 million each year, a slight decrease more than made up for through the bonuses. It was the big-money deal among a number approved Tuesday by the trustees\u2019 compensation committee in a conference call. The trustees also approved a five-year deal for new athletic director Greg Byrne and raises for his assistants. Byrne will make $900,000 a year, with $25,000 annual raises starting next year. New offensive coordinator Brian Daboll will make $1.2 million annually under his three-year deal. Defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt\u2019s new three-year contract is worth $4.2 million, including $100,000 raises each year. Alabama gave Saban an eight-year deal worth $6.9 million annually in 2014. That marked a $1.3 million raise. The Tide has won double-digit games for nine straight seasons and made each of the first three College Football Playoffs. \u201cIt is an exciting day when we can announce that the best football coach in the country has agreed to a contract extension,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cBefore I came to Alabama, I was always impressed with Coach Saban and how he ran his program. After being here and seeing firsthand the job that he does, I\u2019ve come away even more impressed. \u201cCoach Saban has obviously won a lot of football games and championships, but he has also done an outstanding job when it comes to academics and community service. I don\u2019t think you can measure the positive impact he and (wife) Ms. Terry have made over the last decade.\u201d University President Stuart Bell said Alabama\u2019s success in football under Saban has helped the school overall. \u201cIt is truly remarkable when you look at what Coach Saban has accomplished here over the last decade and how the success of the football program has raised the overall profile of our institution,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThose accomplishments are not just on the field, as he has also done an outstanding job emphasizing academics and character development with our student-athletes.\u201d Outside linebackers coach Tosh Lupoi got the biggest raise among the other assistants, a $400,000 pay increase to $950,000. The new deals for the rest of Saban\u2019s assistants, with two-year deals except where noted: \u2014 New co-offensive coordinator Mike Locksley, an analyst last season, will make $1.2 million over the next two years. \u2014 Joe Pannunzio, tight ends/special teams, $375,000. \u2014 Brent Key, offensive line, goes from $350,000 to $400,000. \u2014 Burton Burns, running backs coach, gets a $15,000 raise to $490,000. \u2014 Derrick Ansley, defensive backs, will make $405,000, up from $395,000. \u2014 Karl Dunbar, defensive line, will make $275,000 this year and $575,000 in 2018. \u2014 Scott Cochran, strength and conditioning, will make $535,000 annually under his three-year deal, a $10,000 raise.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/sports/nick-saban-alabama-contract.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T13:34:09-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T13:33:42-04:00", "abstract": "University trustees on Tuesday approved a three-year extension through the 2024 season that again could make Saban college football\u2019s highest-paid coach.", "title": "Alabama Approves Contract Extension for Nick Saban Worth $65 Million"}
