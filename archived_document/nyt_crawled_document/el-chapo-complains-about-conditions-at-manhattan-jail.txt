Its half-dozen cells are never dark and are perpetually monitored by cameras. The prisoners inside never go outdoors. Most days, they get an hour to themselves in a tiny \u201crecreation\u201d room with a treadmill, a stationary bike, a television and a window offering fresh air and a view of Lower Manhattan. Many are not allowed to speak with one another, but then again they rarely come face to face. As the most secure wing of the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the federal jail in Manhattan, 10 South is so austere that a high-ranking mobster who spent several years there once described it as \u201ca torture chamber.\u201d The unit has housed some of the country\u2019s most notorious defendants, from operatives for Al Qaeda to at least one notorious foreign arms dealer \u2014 all of whom were subjected to its harshness before they were convicted of a crime. The most recent \u2014 and perhaps most renowned \u2014 prisoner of 10 South is Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo. In January, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was abruptly flown on a Mexican police jet to an airport on Long Island, then driven to the jail in an armed caravan. Ever since, he has been protesting his conditions of confinement and has taken up an unlikely role as an advocate for prison reform. In a series of court filings, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers have complained on his behalf that from the moment he arrived at 10 South, he has been locked in his cell for 23 hours a day, except for lawyer and court visits, and has been denied all contact with his family and the media. The lawyers claim that he is the most closely guarded inmate in the United States and that the terms of his imprisonment have hindered his ability to prepare for trial. Not only have they asked Judge Brian M. Cogan of Federal District Court in Brooklyn to loosen the restrictions he faces; they have also asked that a researcher from Amnesty International be allowed inside 10 South to investigate conditions. It is a strange turn of events that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, a serial prison escapee who stands accused of killing thousands during Mexico\u2019s bloody drug wars, has claimed the moral high ground as a critic of the penal system. After all, he twice broke out of high-security correctional facilities in Mexico \u2014 first in a laundry cart and then by way of a mile-long tunnel dug by confederates into the shower of his cell. Given his history, federal prosecutors have defended the restrictions as a necessary measure, arguing that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n retains \u201cunparalleled connections\u201d to his associates in the Sinaloa drug cartel \u2014 and has a \u201cproven history\u201d of murdering his enemies even while under lock and key. Though his environment is forbidding, some of the grievances he has lodged with jail officials \u2014 there have been at least 11 of them as of last month \u2014 have been decidedly small-bore. In one motion, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers claimed that the tap water had disturbed his throat, prompting him to ask for bottled water. They also said their client briefly feared that he was hearing voices, though the government contends that he was merely picking up the sounds of a radio being played nearby. That said, the restrictions in 10 South are so severe that loneliness seems to motivate some inmates to break the unit\u2019s rules. One of those inmates, Oussama Kassir, once greeted a fellow Muslim prisoner in Arabic while being escorted down the hall \u201cin the clutch of two prison guards,\u201d according to an affidavit filed by his lawyer. For that infraction, Mr. Kassir lost his telephone privileges for four months. Mr. Kassir was on 10 South for a year and a half, starting in 2007, while awaiting trial on charges that he had tried to establish a jihadi training camp in Oregon. During that time, he also went on a hunger strike to protest his conditions, losing over 25 pounds. Jail officials eventually \u201cbegan force-feeding Mr. Kassir, which caused him great pain,\u201d his lawyer, Edgardo Ramos, wrote in the affidavit. Few inmates have spent as much time on 10 South as Vincent Basciano, who prosecutors say is a former acting boss of the Bonanno crime family. According to his lawyer, Mathew J. Mari, Mr. Basciano once described 10 South as \u201ca torture chamber that is a tool the government uses to try to make a defendant cooperate.\u201d Currently serving life in prison on racketeering charges, Mr. Basciano was eventually moved from the solitary wing to the nation\u2019s most secure federal prison, the so-called Supermax in Florence, Colo. He described the Supermax as \u201ca five-star hotel compared to 10 South,\u201d according to Mr. Mari. The Bureau of Prisons refused to identify the inmates who are now housed at 10 South. But interviews with lawyers and a review of court documents indicate that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s neighbors include Muhanad Mahmoud al-Farekh, a Texan who is accused of being a Qaeda commander and whom the government once considered killing with a drone strike in Pakistan; and Maalik Jones, a Maryland man accused of fighting alongside the Shabab militant group in Somalia. Until last month, a Qaeda operative named Ibrahim Suleiman Adnan Adam Harun was also on 10 South. His behavior was loud and erratic and, according to his lawyers, he had a mental illness. He argued with himself frequently and vocally and at one point tried to knit what was described in court as a suit of armor out of milk cartons. According to a psychologist who examined him, Mr. Harun slept on the floor of his cell to avoid his prison bedding, which the defendant claimed hindered his body \u201cfrom recharging electrons.\u201d Lawyers visiting their clients on 10 South have said they often heard a din emanating from one of the cells, which they believe to have been Mr. Harun\u2019s. The cells on 10 South are generally 17 by 8 feet. But prosecutors say that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has the largest cell on the wing and that prison officials have adequately addressed some of his complaints. For instance, he now receives six small bottles of water every two weeks, court papers say. The prosecutors also note that he has a radio and was permitted to buy a clock from the prison commissary. Though the clock was taken from him a few days after he bought it \u2014 \u201cwith no explanation and no refund,\u201d according to his lawyers \u2014 he recently got it back. As an added security measure, the government has denied Mr. Guzm\u00e1n family visits, including from his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, a former beauty queen whose father, the authorities say, cultivated poppies and marijuana for one of her husband\u2019s top lieutenants. His lawyers \u2014 currently, public defenders \u2014 claim that keeping Mr. Guzm\u00e1n from his wife has infringed on his ability to seek advice as he decides whether to hire private counsel. The prosecution has, as well, sought to screen any non-Americans on Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s legal team, concerned that a spy for the cartel might infiltrate his defense. As for his request for an investigation by Amnesty International, the prosecutors recently asked Judge Cogan to deny it, saying that the group had \u201cno oversight authority\u201d over the prison and was \u201cnot a party to this prosecution.\u201d Even with these various restrictions, however, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has almost daily visits from a small army of lawyers, paralegals, investigators and interpreters \u2014 an unusual privilege for an inmate on 10 South. According to court papers, he spends an average of 21 hours a week with his defense team, suggesting that his isolation is considerably less severe than other prisoners\u2019. And yet, it would seem, the indignities of life behind bars have gotten under his skin. Last week, his lawyers filed a motion saying that although he is allowed to watch TV in the rec room, the set is not visible from the exercise bike, forcing him to choose between watching and working out. This, the lawyers noted, was one of the \u201cnonsensical obstacles\u201d that \u201cfurther Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sense of frustration and isolation.\u201d Nor is he permitted to choose the channel, since officials at 10 South have \u201cimposed some sort of programming limitation\u201d on Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, his lawyers said. Among the few shows that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has been able to view is a \u201cnature program about a rhinoceros\u201d that, they said, has been \u201creplayed numerous times.\u201d", "published_date": "2017-04-23T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "abstract": "The drug lord and serial prison escapee has been protesting issues including the tap water, visitor restrictions and the television programming in the rec room.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/nyregion/el-chapo-complains-about-conditions-at-manhattan-jail.html", "source": "The New York Times"}
