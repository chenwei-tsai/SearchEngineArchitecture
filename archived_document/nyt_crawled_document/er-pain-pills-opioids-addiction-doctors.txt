Wergin, trying to smile through deeply etched lines of exhaustion. \u201cThursdays, it\u2019s Philly cheesesteaks.\u201d Her back ached from a compression fracture; a shattered elbow was still mending; her left-hip sciatica was screaming louder than usual. She takes a lot of medication for chronic pain, but today it was just not enough. Yet rather than increasing her dose, Dr. Wergin was tapering her down. \u201cSusan, we\u2019ve got to get you to five pills a day,\u201d he said gently. She winced. Such conversations are becoming routine in doctors\u2019 offices across the country. A growing number of states are enacting measures to limit prescription opioids, highly addictive medicines that alleviate severe pain but have contributed to a surging epidemic of overdoses and deaths. This week the federal government issued the first national guidelines intended to reduce use of the drugs. In Nebraska, Medicaid patients like Ms. Kubicka-Welander, 56, may face limits this year that have been recommended by a state drug review board. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the final numbers will be,\u201d Dr. Wergin told her, \u201cbut we have to get you ready.\u201d As politicians and policy makers decry the opioid crisis, the country\u2019s success in confronting it may well depend on the ability of physicians like Dr. Wergin to reconcile their new role as enforcer with their mission of caring for patients. Collectively, primary care physicians write the greatest volume of opioid prescriptions \u2014 according to a recent study, 15.3 million prescriptions for Medicare patients alone in 2013. The burden of monitoring patients for potential abuse, while still treating pain that is chronic and real, falls largely on these front-line gatekeepers. \u201cI have a patient with inoperable spinal stenosis who needs to be able to keep chopping wood to heat his home,\u201d said Dr. Wergin, 61, the only physician in this rural town. \u201cA one-size-fits-all prescription algorithm just doesn\u2019t fit him. But I have to comply.\u201d In prescribing opioids, Dr. Wergin, who is also chairman of the board of the American Academy of Family Physicians, is taking professional and personal risks. He must go through an elaborate prescription checklist, with state and federal officials looking over his shoulder. He has faced threats from addicts who show up at the hospital emergency room, desperate for pills. Following the recommendation of his malpractice insurance carrier, he now requires his patients to sign \u201cpain management contracts,\u201d in which they must agree to random drug tests before receiving an opioid prescription. Though he has been enmeshed in his patients\u2019 lives for decades, having gone to grade school with many of them and delivered their children and grandchildren, the new vigilance has injected an uncomfortable layer of suspicion in his relationships with them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop prescribing opioids altogether,\u201d Dr. Wergin said. \u201cBut I can see why some doctors have gotten to that point.\u201d Pain is one of the chief reasons people go to their doctor. Once overlooked and even dismissed, pain has been a standard vital sign on a patient work-up for nearly two decades. But unlike blood pressure, it is difficult to measure, not least because people\u2019s ability to tolerate pain is highly individual. Often an orthopedic surgeon or emergency room physician will write an initial opioid prescription for \u201cshort-term use,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan H. Chen, an instructor at the Stanford University School of Medicine who researched the Medicare data, but \u201cthe prescribing doctor never sees the patient again and never realizes the problem they triggered.\u201d The patient follows up with a primary care doctor, who now has to manage the patient\u2019s opioid use. Dr. Wergin\u2019s patients often lack the means to consult pain specialists in Lincoln, the closest city, 30 miles away. So he is their doctor of first and last resort. Wherever you turn in Milford (population 2,090), there he is: the doctor for a local nursing home, for the town\u2019s volunteer fire department, for the high school sports teams, sometimes making house calls in his weather-beaten Chevy Tahoe. When his patients are hospitalized, it is to him they complain about the overcooked salmon, expecting he can take care of that, too. Buoyant and chatty, Dr. Wergin seems to have stepped out of a Norman Rockwell painting, with his faux-threats to give rambunctious young patients a \u201cmind-your-mother shot,\u201d and his prescriptions for relieving his own stress: baking pies or road-testing his 1962 red Corvette. And so he is particularly uneasy about the skepticism he must now bring to patient care. Patients look at him, stricken and indignant, when asked to sign a pain contract. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m an addict?\u201d they say. Or, \u201cI don\u2019t need a contract for my heart medicine, so why this?\u201d Why? When a random drug test of one longtime patient showed no trace of prescribed opioids, Dr. Wergin had to \u201cfire\u201d him for breaking the contract. Instead of taking the pills, the patient had been selling them. Dr. Wergin has learned to be even more wary during his emergency room shifts at the hospital 15 miles away. There, he has seen firsthand a growing number of overdoses and opioid-related deaths. The scenario has become so familiar that now when a nurse reports that the patient in Room 3 is complaining of excruciating back pain and asking specifically for Percocet, Dr. Wergin will reply, \u201cAnd is he about 31, single or divorced, and insisting he is allergic to nonsteroidals?\u201d These are \u201cseekers \u2019n\u2019 sellers,\u201d he explained, who peel off I-80 and head for the hospital \u201cthinking we\u2019re just ignorant hayseeds.\u201d A few months ago, state troopers pulled guns on one such man, who had stormed into the hospital demanding pain medications and threatening Dr. Wergin and other staff members. As Dr. Wergin recounted this, driving through the fog-shrouded back roads of winter-stubble prairie, where patients are rushed to the emergency room after being crushed by forklifts and tractor tipovers, he recoiled against his own cynicism. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to become so jaded that you assume everyone in the E.R. is a drug-seeker,\u201d he said. Still, he has made adjustments. He now rarely writes prescriptions for oxycodone, which is prized on the street. For other painkillers, he logs into an electronic pharmacy registry to view the patient\u2019s other medications. Although every state but Missouri has such a system, Nebraska\u2019s, like many, is not foolproof: patients can opt out for privacy reasons and not all insurers, who supply the data, opt in. And most state electronic systems are not compatible with one another. \u201cA Nebraska patient can just drive 80 miles to a Kansas E.R. and get another prescription and no one would know,\u201d Dr. Wergin said. Prosecutors and medical review boards are increasingly scrutinizing physicians who prescribe controlled substances. A colleague of Dr. Wergin\u2019s in a nearby community was investigated for two years after a patient died of an overdose. Although she was cleared, the reputation of her small-town practice was damaged. She moved to another state. The management of chronic pain has had a long, fractious history in the United States. In the 1990s, doctors were admonished for undertreating pain. Opioids, they were told, including newer ones like OxyContin, could be safely prescribed and bring life-changing relief. Now the pendulum has swung sharply back and doctors have been scrambling for alternatives. Some state medical boards recommend limiting the number of opioid doses per month. Others limit by strength of daily dose. The new guidelines by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise primary care doctors to treat pain first with measures such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Three days of opioids will usually suffice, they said, and rarely more than seven. Although much contention surrounded the drafting of the guidelines, everyone generally agrees that patients should not be custodians of large quantities of opioids. One of Dr. Wergin\u2019s patients, Gene Filbert, 64, had been taking 240 short-acting hydrocodones a month, or about eight a day, to keep at bay the pounding pain that has resisted five surgeries for the elbow and wrist he smashed in a fall while installing a telephone line. An alternative, fentanyl, a slow-release, higher-dose patch, nauseates him. Dr. Wergin has now inched him down to 180 pills a month \u2014 but the coming Nebraska limit may be 150. In a small town, lots of folks know about Mr. Filbert\u2019s pain \u2014 and his pills. \u201cPeople ask me all the time if they can have a few,\u201d said Mr. Filbert, a man with a raspy voice and a silver-streaked beard. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018Hell no, the doctor\u2019s shorting me already!\u2019 \u201d Many medical associations now offer doctors training about opioids and chronic pain, urging them first to use other remedies: physical therapy, acupuncture, anti-inflammatories, antidepressants, counseling. But alternatives are unrealistic for some. Physical therapy is too expensive for Ms. Kubicka-Welander: she can scarcely make the rent on her home in a trailer court. Patients with a compromised liver cannot take high doses of acetaminophen. Those on blood-thinners should not use ibuprofen. Dr. Wergin is careful not to assure patients that they will be \u201cpain-free.\u201d Instead, he talks about setting realistic goals while living with pain. Can they work? Walk? Sleep? The problems faced by Beverly TeSelle, 71, defy most solutions. After a second stroke that left her using a wheelchair, Mrs. TeSelle, formerly a gregarious accountant, began to suffer vicious headaches that left her weeping and moaning. \u201cThe biggest relief for both of us is when she goes to sleep,\u201d her husband of 53 years, Larry, said, tearfully. Dr. Wergin noted that Mrs. TeSelle, whose strokes have also left her with slurred speech, and hand, arm and shoulder pain, already takes more than what may be allowed by coming state limits. He considered increasing the dose of her fentanyl patches but said, \u201cI worry about respiratory depression.\u201d He reviewed the list of her medications. \u201cLet\u2019s at least try to reduce those headaches so she can talk with her friends and family,\u201d he said, recalibrating doses. Dr. Wergin\u2019s final patient of the day, a 55-year-old woman, had three rotated vertebrae in her lower back, migraines and a mastectomy for breast cancer this fall. She asked not to identified because she worried her opioid use might jeopardize her job. Her fibromyalgia was flaring up, she told Dr. Wergin. Pain was aggravating her insomnia. \u201cAnd you have to cut my pills again?\u201d she asked. Dr. Wergin nodded. \u201cIt will be very difficult to get an override for your dose.\u201d Instead, he increased her antidepressant. \u201cIt\u2019s people like my husband who screwed the rest of us over,\u201d she said. Her husband, she explained, used to sell methamphetamine and OxyContin. His doctor in Lincoln would readily write prescriptions. One night six years ago, she found her husband on the floor of their bedroom, dead, mostly likely from an overdose. \u201cIt\u2019s rough cutting back when I\u2019m at a level that almost works,\u201d she said to Dr. Wergin. A rare flicker of frustration crossed his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dr. Wergin said.", "abstract": "A growing number of states are enacting measures to limit prescription opioids, addictive medicines that have led to an epidemic of overdoses and deaths."}
