Poetry could be an answer, except there\u2019s nothing fresh about the idea. A century ago, The Times recorded milestones of World War I with front-page poems by Rudyard Kipling, who was at the time probably the best-known poet and storyteller in the English language, as well as a blustery champion of British imperialism. (His critics put it less kindly.) At least three Kipling poems appeared on Page 1 during the war. \u201cFor All We Have and Are\u201d was placed in the upper right corner of the front page of Sept. 2, 1914: From that opening, readers could have had little doubt about Kipling\u2019s view of Germany. To an American critic at the time, Kipling wrote, \u201cIf Germany, by any means, is victorious you may rest assured that it will be a very short time before she turns her attention to the United States.\u201d Kipling rejoiced when the United States entered the war, as \u201cThe Choice\u201d made plain on April 13, 1917. His impatience with America\u2019s earlier neutrality was obvious. But so was his pleasure that the \u201cAmerican Spirit\u201d had chosen to stand with \u201cFreedom\u2019s brotherhood,\u201d that \u201cthe flesh should die, And not the living soul.\u201d The death of one\u2019s flesh in the war was no abstraction for Kipling. His 18-year-old son, John, a lieutenant in the Irish Guards, disappeared during the Battle of Loos in September 1915. Though Rudyard and his wife, Carrie, searched for John ardently and long held on to the hope that he\u2019d been imprisoned rather than killed, they had to reconcile themselves eventually to his death. (John was played Daniel Radcliffe in the 2008 television production, \u201cMy Boy Jack.\u201d) As the couple wrestled with their son\u2019s loss, Kipling wrote one of his most revered poems, the quietly elegiac \u201cMy Boy Jack.\u201d It was titled \u201cDestroyers at Jutland\u201d when it first appeared in The Times on Oct. 19, 1916:", "item_type": "Article"}
