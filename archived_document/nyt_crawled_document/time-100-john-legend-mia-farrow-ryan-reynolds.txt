{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "The wine glasses clinked and the banter was jovial as dozens of A-listers in evening wear \u2014 including Ryan Reynolds, Sarah Paulson and Trevor Noah \u2014 settled in over plates of poached Maine lobster Tuesday night in the vaulting atrium of Jazz at Lincoln Center overlooking Columbus Circle. Everything, in other words, was in place for the lavish Time 100 Gala celebrating 100 \u201cactivists, artists, leaders and entrepreneurs who are changing the world,\u201d as the evening\u2019s program put it. Well, almost everything. As Nancy Gibbs, the magazine\u2019s editor in chief, informed the crowd from the stage, there were a number of key elements missing, including the honoree Leila de Lima, a Philippine senator, who \u201ccould not be here tonight because she is in jail, for protesting the policies of the president.\u201d An honoree from last year, Denis Mukwege, was coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo \u201cuntil he had to cancel at the last minute because one of his colleagues was assassinated,\u201d she added. \u201cThey are not soldiers, they are doctors.\u201d This certainly never happens at the Met Gala. Then again, the annual Time 100 bash is a most unusual gala, a glittering celebration not of celebrity, but of influence. Sprinkled among the standard-issue entertainment luminaries (Mia Farrow, Samantha Bee and Barry Jenkins, the director of \u201cMoonlight\u201d) were the likes of Thelma Aldana, the attorney general of Guatemala, whose anticorruption campaign helped topple the government, and Raed Saleh, the head of Syrian Civil Defense, the volunteer rescue force known as the White Helmets. But \u201cinfluence\u201d does not necessarily mean \u201csaintly,\u201d said Arianna Huffington, who was making her 11th appearance at the gala. The left-leaning internet news mogul took a swipe at the current occupant of the Oval Office when she said: \u201cAs always with Time, it\u2019s not always people being recognized for doing good. It\u2019s just for having a big impact, whether it\u2019s good or bad. Kim Jong-un is on it, Donald Trump is on it, Putin is on it.\u201d Alas, to have a seat at that table. In fact, those world leaders were predictable no-shows (although Mr. Trump did attend last year). As guests settled in for appetizers, Demi Lovato belted out three numbers on stage while a driving rain pelted the soaring windows of the space. Later, John Legend closed out the festivities by performing hits like \u201cAll of Me\u201d and \u201cGlory.\u201d No wonder Gavin Grimm was looking a little star-struck. The transgender 17-year-old from Gloucester, Va., whose decision to use the boys\u2019 bathroom at school ended up as a case before the United States Supreme Court, was standing alongside his mother, Deirdre Grimm. Wearing a baggy gray suit, he looked as if he had won a golden ticket from some highly politicized Willy Wonka as he surveyed the celebrity-packed room. \u201cWhen I think back to that 15-year-old kid in front of a school board, I could never imagine it ending up like it\u2019s ended up now,\u201d said the polite teenager, whose case was sent back to a lower court in March. \u201cI\u2019m just hoping I don\u2019t knock anybody\u2019s drink over or anything like that.\u201d", "title": "John Legend, Mia Farrow and Ryan Reynolds at Time 100 Gala", "abstract": "Fame is not the only measure at Time magazine\u2019s annual gala, which celebrates activists as well as Hollywood stars.", "section": "Fashion & Style", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-26T14:43:29-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/fashion/time-100-john-legend-mia-farrow-ryan-reynolds.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T14:43:29-04:00"}
