So my husband got a younger cat to be her pet. The younger cat was always subservient to the older one, and he kept her happy for many years. The older one passed away recently, and John wants to mix some of her ashes into the younger one\u2019s wet food, because he believes it\u2019s what our cat \u201cwould have wanted.\u201d John and this cat obviously had an intense relationship, and this court stands in something close to awe of John\u2019s intuitive and slightly perverse pet-for-a-pet scheme. I am almost willing to believe that John\u2019s cat telepathy is correct: A cat that pees on a laptop would probably enjoy forcing another cat to unknowingly feast on its bones. But nonetheless this court forbids it. Your younger cat has suffered enough and deserves to start a new chapter without death food.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T05:00:08-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/magazine/judge-john-hodgman-on-what-the-cat-would-have-wanted.html", "item_type": "Article"}
