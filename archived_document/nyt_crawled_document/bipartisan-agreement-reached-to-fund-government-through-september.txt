{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan agreement on Sunday to fund the government through September, according to congressional aides from both parties, effectively ending suspense about the possibility of a government shutdown next weekend. The agreement, which still must be voted on by lawmakers, includes increased funding for the military and for border security, according to two of the aides. It does not include funding for the wall that President Trump wants to build along the border with Mexico, the aides said. Details of the agreement were not yet public on Sunday night. Lawmakers had already taken action to keep the government open while they finalized the spending agreement. On Friday, Congress approved a one-week spending measure that averted a shutdown on Saturday, Mr. Trump\u2019s 100th day in office. That action prevented what would have been a major political embarrassment for Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans, who, despite having control of both houses of Congress and the White House, were unable to pass any marquee legislation in the president\u2019s first 100 days.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/politics/bipartisan-agreement-reached-to-fund-government-through-september.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T22:31:40-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T22:29:37-04:00", "abstract": "Congressional leaders reached a spending agreement on Sunday, aides from both parties said, effectively ending the threat of a government shutdown next weekend.", "title": "Bipartisan Agreement Reached to Fund Government Through September"}
