{"text": "Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) The sofas are filthy, ugly, out of place \u2014 and oddly poignant. Discarded sidewalk furniture is a fixture in Los Angeles. But for Andrew Ward, a photographer, they\u2019re more than just trash. His project \u201cSofas of L.A.\u201d began five years ago as a hobby on Instagram. Since then, it\u2019s grown into an obsession and led to international exhibits and plans for a book later this year. \u201cMost people who live in L.A., when they see a photograph of an abandoned sofa, to them it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, my God. I know exactly\u2019 \u2014 they can\u2019t get the words out,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they understand it.\u201d Abandoned couches are not unique to Los Angeles. But their ubiquity has made them in a way synonymous with the city. A sanitation spokeswoman, Heather Johnson, said she couldn\u2019t immediately provide figures on sofa removals. But she said more than 30,000 tons of \u201cbulky items\u201d were collected in scheduled pickups in 2016. Mr. Ward, 45, who is Irish-born and works as an assistant director in Hollywood for his day job, said when you start paying attention, you see the couches everywhere. \u201cI call it the Ikea-ization of our homes,\u201d he said. \u201cFurniture sort of becomes disposable.\u201d Los Angeles\u2019s transitory population also likely plays a part. More than half of residents are renters, people perhaps less devoted to their neighborhoods than owners. Mr. Ward has amassed thousands of sofa images. Each one is oriented with the couch dead center, a style inspired by Bernd and Hilla Becher, the German husband and wife known for their photography of postwar industrial scenery. Dislocated from the intimacy of the home, the sofas can be jarring in the dull and impersonal environment of the street. But not always. \u201cIt tells a really, really deep story about L.A.,\u201d said Tracy Lew, director of the James Corcoran Gallery in Los Angeles. \u201cThere\u2019s a story about the person who left it because their entire imprint is left.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd as horrible as it looks in many ways, it\u2019s sort of found a new home.\u201d Mr. Ward said the sofas sometimes blend seamlessly into the d\u00e9cor of the street. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they were designed to belong there.\u201d (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) \u2022 This part of President Trump\u2019s tax plan would hurt Californians more than than residents of almost any other state.

[San Francisco Chronicle] Many animals are illegal to own as pets in California. For one reason or another, you can\u2019t have ocelots, hedgehogs, sugar gliders or monkeys. But one of the most contentious prohibitions is against the ferret. In only two states, California and Hawaii, is it illegal to keep the playful, if sharp-toothed, cousin of the weasel. So what\u2019s the problem with ferrets? A California statute from the 1930s banned ferrets because they were nonnative. To this day, waterfowl and other environmental groups support keeping the rule over fears that ferrets could pose a threat to birds. But ferret enthusiasts have argued that the animals are fully domesticated and less threatening to wildlife than, for example, house cats. State officials have been reluctant to make a change. \u201cWe have incredible biodiversity here in California,\u201d said Jordan Traverso, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what the impacts are.\u201d No one knows exactly how many ferrets are illicitly kept in California, but activists estimate at least 100,000. On Wednesday, at a public hearing of the state\u2019s Fish and Game Commission, ferret owners argued in favor of a petition to allow special permits for ferrets that have been neutered and vaccinated. Kelli Stein, of San Luis Obispo County, fought back tears as she described being cited by animal control officers and ordered to send her ferret, Kokomo, beyond state lines. \u201cShe was my baby,\u201d she said. \u201cShe made life very much better for me and my family.\u201d The petition was rejected.
