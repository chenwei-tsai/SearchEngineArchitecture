{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump ordered his Treasury Department on Friday to review measures put in place by the Obama administration, setting the stage for a rollback of regulations that were intended to curtail corporate tax evasion and prevent another financial crisis. The executive order and two presidential memorandums come as Mr. Trump is scrambling for achievements as the 100-day mark in the White House approaches. Frustrated by the slow pace of action in Congress on his goal of overhauling the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation legislation and the fact that his mission of rewriting the tax code remains in limbo, Mr. Trump is attempting to take matters into his own hands. \u201cThis has to do with the complexity of tax regulations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said at a briefing ahead of the signing on Friday. \u201cThe president wants to make clear to the American people that we are going to fix the tax code.\u201d Mr. Trump has made deregulating the financial industry a priority of his presidency. Critics of the president said that if the reviews that he is requesting became policy it would represent a return to the freewheeling days that led up to the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cFrom our perspective, it is a direction that is dramatically backwards on financial stability,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. The presidential order asks Mr. Mnuchin to review the tax regulations imposed by President Barack Obama in 2016. Those include efforts to clamp down on corporate inversions \u2014 in which American companies merge with foreign companies to take advantage of lower tax rates abroad. Viewed alone, undoing the rules would appear to be at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to reduce incentives for companies to invert. Last year Mr. Obama\u2019s Treasury Department, concerned about Pfizer\u2019s $150 billion bid to acquire Allergan, issued rules to clamp down on \u201cserial inverters\u201d and to prevent \u201cearnings-stripping\u201d \u2014 when an American subsidiary borrows from a parent company and uses the interest payments on the loans to offset its earnings. Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant, said reversing those rules would be a gift to Wall Street bankers and lawyers who have complained that international deal making has been hampered by the regulations. \u201cThey\u2019ll be dancing in the streets and jumping for joy,\u201d Mr. Willens said. The memorandums to the executive order will ask Mr. Mnuchin to review the Orderly Liquidation Authority, a tool created by the Dodd-Frank law for unwinding financial institutions that are on the verge of collapse. Many banks have been hopeful that Congress will repeal the system. The administration is examining whether it encourages excessive risk-taking or exposes taxpayers to potential liabilities. Treasury is also reviewing the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which designates financial institutions as \u201csystemically important,\u201d better known as \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d It requires them to hold more capital in reserve in the event of financial emergencies. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, assailed Mr. Trump for trying to undermine rules that were put in place to protect the economy: \u201cAny actions to undermine these protections encourage Wall Street\u2019s risky behavior and leave taxpayers and our economy exposed to another catastrophe.\u201d Mr. Brown said that Mr. Trump appeared to be breaking a campaign promise by making it easier for companies to use inversions. \u201cWe should be working to lower taxes for hardworking families and workers across Ohio, not helping multimillion-dollar corporations cheat the system to avoid paying their fair share,\u201d Mr. Brown said. Mr. Mnuchin insisted that this would not be the case. He said that the administration was working on a soon-to-be released comprehensive tax reform plan that would address the problem of companies moving overseas.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/us/politics/trump-order-takes-aim-at-tax-regulations-imposed-by-obama.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T12:31:01-04:00", "abstract": "Eager to roll back the Dodd-Frank legislation and overhaul the tax code, President Trump directed the Treasury Department to review measures that would curtail corporate tax evasion.", "title": "Trump Order Takes Aim at Tax Regulations Imposed by Obama", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "U.S.", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T12:31:01-04:00"}
