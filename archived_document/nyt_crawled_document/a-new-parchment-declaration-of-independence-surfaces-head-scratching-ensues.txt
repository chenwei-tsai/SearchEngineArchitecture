Globe-spanning intrigue ensues \u2014 accompanied, offscreen, by a tsunami of eye-rolling by actual historians. But now, in a bit of real-life archival drama, a pair of scholars are announcing a surprising discovery: a previously unknown early handwritten parchment of the Declaration, buried in a provincial archive in Britain. The document is the only other 18th-century handwritten parchment Declaration known to exist besides the one from 1776 now displayed at the National Archives in Washington. It isn\u2019t an official government document, like the 1776 parchment, but a display copy created in the mid-1780s, the researchers argue, by someone who wanted to influence debate over the Constitution. It may not hold the key to a Masonic conspiracy, as in \u201cNational Treasure.\u201d But its subtle details, the scholars argue, illuminate an enduring puzzle at the heart of American politics: Was the country founded by a unitary national people, or by a collection of states? \u201cThat is really the key riddle of the American system,\u201d said Danielle Allen, a professor of government at Harvard, who discovered the document with a colleague, Emily Sneff. That riddle has bedeviled American history, from debates over Southern secession to calls to abolish the Electoral College today. And it was the burning question in the mid-1780s, when the American experiment was at risk of falling apart, and the push for a federal constitution, creating a strong national government (with, crucially, the right to tax), gained steam. The new parchment will hardly end the argument. But it \u201creally shifts our understanding in how the nationalist position emerged,\u201d Ms. Allen said. It remains to be seen what scholars will make of the discovery, which will be announced on Friday at a conference at Yale. A paper, posted online, runs through a wealth of textual and material evidence supporting the claim that the document, while found in Britain, was created in America in the 1780s. Ms. Allen and Ms. Sneff\u2019s conference presentation will focus on their leading candidate for person behind it: James Wilson, a Pennsylvania lawyer and one of the strongest nationalists at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, who probably commissioned the parchment. Some historians who have previewed their research are impressed. \u201cThe sleuthing they\u2019ve done is just remarkable,\u201d said Benjamin Irvin, an associate professor of history at the University of Arizona and the author of \u201cClothed in Robes of Sovereignty,\u201d a 2011 study of the Continental Congress. The identification as American, from the mid-1780s, he added, \u201clooks pretty watertight.\u201d And the whodunit? William Ewald, a legal historian at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who is writing a biography of Wilson, said he found the case for Wilson \u2014 one of six men who signed both the Declaration and the Constitution, and the rare founder to invoke the earlier document in the 1780s \u2014 \u201cvery plausible.\u201d Even if that attribution is wrong, Mr. Ewald added, the parchment is still \u201cthe discovery of a lifetime.\u201d \u201cEvery 20 years or so, someone discovers an unknown copy of one of the newspaper printings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a new formal parchment \u2014 how many people can say they found that?\u201d The new discovery grew out of the Declaration Resources Project, which Ms. Allen, the author of the book \u201cOur Declaration,\u201d created in 2015 as a clearinghouse for information about the myriad versions \u2014 newspaper printings, broadsides, ornamental engravings \u2014 that circulated in the decades after independence. So far, the project\u2019s database counts some 306 made between July 4, 1776, when Congress commissioned a broadside from the Philadelphia printer John Dunlap, and 1800. (The parchment \u201coriginal\u201d at the National Archives was in fact signed in early August 1776, nearly a month after independence.) Soon after the effort started, Ms. Sneff, the project manager, noticed an entry in an online catalog of British archives listing a parchment copy of the Declaration held by the West Sussex Records Office in Chichester, England. \u201cI was very skeptical but intrigued,\u201d she said. (The document was part of a cache deposited in West Sussex in 1953 by a law firm connected with the dukes of Richmond.) She requested an image. Then, last summer, she and Ms. Allen traveled to Britain to see the original, which had been folded into a small square. \u201cI was on pins and needles,\u201d Ms. Allen recalled. \u201cI thought we would turn it over and the back would say, \u2018Ha, ha, we fooled you!\u2019\u201d The parchment \u2014 the only known iteration of the Declaration oriented horizontally \u2014 was stylistically similar to 18th-century American legal and mercantile documents, suggesting it was made by a commercial clerk, probably in New York or Philadelphia. (A comparison with more than 150 handwriting samples drew no matches to known individuals.) Some details of the text suggest that whoever created it had had access to congressional records, including the 1776 parchment. But it deviated from that parchment \u2014 along with every known 18th-century version of the Declaration \u2014 in one striking respect: the ordering of the 56 signatures. All known 18th-century iterations, Ms. Allen said, show the signatures grouped by state, with some printers even adding state labels. But here they were all jumbled. \u201cI just kept staring at it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no discernible order.\u201d But then she labeled each name with the number of the column it appeared in on the 1776 parchment, and noticed that they alternated in a clear pattern \u2014 a pattern, she and Ms. Sneff argue, created with help from a well-known 18th-century cipher. That random order, Ms. Allen and Ms. Sneff argue, was meant to send a political message: The signers pledged \u201cto each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor,\u201d as the last line puts it, as individuals, not as representatives of states. And that message, they argue, points to Wilson. Today, he is remembered by the public, if he is remembered at all, as the flip-flopper in the musical \u201c1776,\u201d who can\u2019t decide whether or not to vote for independence. But at the Constitutional Convention, he was the leading voice for a strong national government, undergirded by popular sovereignty. \u201cCan we forget for whom we are forming a government?\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIs it for men, or for the imaginary beings called states?\u201d He was also the rare politician of the 1780s to repeatedly cite the Declaration \u2014 a document whose history he would have had the chance to ponder, Ms. Allen and Ms. Sneff note, during research he is known to have done in 1785 in the archives of the Continental Congress. \u201cBefore he does that archival work, he doesn\u2019t reference the Declaration,\u201d Ms. Allen said. Afterward, \u201che always cites it\u201d when making the nationalist argument. There are other riddles to be unwoven, including with just how the document got to England. The researchers\u2019 preliminary hypothesis? It passed into the possession of the third Duke of Richmond, a supporter of American independence, possibly through Thomas Paine. But for now, they point to a broader lesson: Every iteration of the Declaration has a story to tell. \u201cThis one,\u201d Ms. Sneff said, \u201cjust happens to tell a pretty significant one.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T10:08:32-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/arts/a-new-parchment-declaration-of-independence-surfaces-head-scratching-ensues.html", "item_type": "Article"}
