{"text": "On a recent overcast afternoon, the line to enter Made Nice, a new 31-seat fast-casual restaurant, snaked onto the sidewalk and down West 28th Street. After all, Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, of the lauded restaurants Eleven Madison Park and  NoMad, were attached. Inside the space, with its high ceilings, a Shepard Fairey mural and an open kitchen, some customers excitedly pored over paper menus and trawled for tables, while those lucky enough to be seated were tucking into their quinoa tabbouleh with falafel and pickled beets or khao salad with steak, crispy rice and roasted broccoli. The upbeat background music \u2014 a mix of hip-hop, \u201990s hits and current tunes \u2014 added to the festive vibe. SHIVANI VORA IN THE SEATS Ehtesham Malik, 27, who lives in Harlem; Yuchen Lu, 24, and Chunli Liang, 25, who live in Jersey City; and Julia Park, 20, who lives on the West Side. All are actuary interns for a major insurance company. ON THE PLATES  Mr. Malik chose the salmon r\u00f6sti, which is a fris\u00e9e salad with smoked salmon, a soft-boiled egg, dill-caper relish, potato croutons, cucumbers, radishes and pickled onions dressed in a buttermilk vinaigrette ($15). To drink, he ordered the Dr. Greens, a house-made soda with apples, mint and celery ($3.50). Ms. Park and Ms. Liang both ate the chicken rice, a combination of braised chicken thighs, basmati rice, Parmesan, tomatoes, scallions, rosemary and lemon ($14). Ms. Lu went with the curried cauliflower, which also had tofu, couscous, coconut, lemongrass, almonds and grapes ($11). For dessert, she ordered the milk and honey soft-serve ice cream with honey brittle, oat shortbread and buckwheat honey ($6). WHY THEY CAME The meal had become a tradition. The foursome instantly bonded when they met in January at the start of their internships, and they have had lunch together once a week ever since. But this occasion was special because Ms. Park, Ms. Liang and Ms. Lu were finishing their internships (Mr. Malik will continue through the summer), and they were unsure when they would have the chance to dine together again. \u201cThis is sort of our goodbye lunch,\u201d Ms. Lu said. They went to Made Nice because she had read about the opening and thought the restaurant sounded interesting and affordable. WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT Mr. Malik started off by telling the three women about a new office building he had heard about in the Flatiron neighborhood where the employees are plied with free food all day. He said the building also had a game room and a spiffy gym with classes. The four discussed their workweek and the projects they were in the middle of and wrapping up. \u201cThe hours are manageable so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re working all the time,\u201d Mr. Malik said. After getting shoptalk out of the way, they discussed the jazz performance Ms. Lu and Ms. Liang had caught the night before at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola at Lincoln Center. \u201cThe show was good but not as good as other jazz shows I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Ms. Lu said. Ms. Liang then told the group that she had plans to see \u201cWicked\u201d that evening, a Broadway show long on her wish list. \u201cI love culture and try to see as many performances, shows and concerts as I can, which is easy to do in New York,\u201d she said. The conversation eventually turned to their plans for the coming months. Ms. Liang and Ms. Park would be heading back to Canada, where they both go to school. Ms. Lu was also wrapping up her internship and was set to travel to California to study for the actuary exam in June. \u201cI\u2019ll look for a job after I take the exam,\u201d she said. Ms. Malik\u2019s internship will run through mid-August, and he, too, plans to study for the actuary exam and hunt for a job. \u201cWe\u2019re all focused on our futures,\u201d he said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/made-nice-restaurant-interns.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T18:57:58-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T18:57:58-04:00", "abstract": "At the recently opened Made Nice in Manhattan, four 20-somethings enjoy their last weekly lunch together as their internships come to a close.", "title": "A Restaurant Opens, a Tradition Ends"}
