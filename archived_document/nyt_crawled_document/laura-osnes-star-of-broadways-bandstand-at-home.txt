{"text": "The living room floor slopes in Laura Osnes\u2019s fifth-floor walk-up on the Upper West Side, baffling Lyla, the resident Chihuahua, making guests question their alcohol intake and necessitating the removal of the rolling desk chair. The kitchen is of a size that invites unfavorable comparisons to a postage stamp, and the dishwasher is 35 years old (that would be Ms. Osnes\u2019s husband, Nathan Johnson). But there is a deck, high ceilings and exposed brick \u2014 and thanks to the five-flight climb, absolutely no need to join a gym. It\u2019s all very \u201cBarefoot in the Park,\u201d an association that delights the apartment\u2019s occupants, who, while approaching their 10th anniversary, seem as much like newlyweds as the characters in that Neil Simon play. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy here,\u201d said Ms. Osnes, 31, a two-time Tony Award nominee (for the musicals \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d and \u201cRodgers & Hammerstein\u2019s Cinderella\u201d) and a star of the Broadway musical \u201cBandstand,\u201d which opened April 26. When Ms. Osnes triumphed in a reality show talent competition and won the lead in the 2007 Broadway revival of the musical \u201cGrease,\u201d the prize didn\u2019t include help in smoothing the way from her home in Eagan, Minn., to the mean streets of Manhattan. \u201cIt was like, \u2018See you in New York for your first rehearsal,\u2019\u201d recalled Ms. Osnes, who was knee-deep in wedding plans at the time. She and Mr. Johnson, an actor turned photographer, came east to scout the territory and found a one-bedroom on the 31st floor of the Orion, a shiny new high-rise condominium near Times Square. The unit\u2019s owner was offering a year\u2019s lease, and the newlyweds grabbed it, lured by the view, the unsullied surfaces and the location. \u201cIt was super close to the theater I\u2019d be working at,\u201d Ms. Osnes said. \u201cThere were laundry facilities a floor away, and a doorman. And they served continental breakfast. Moving here with a job and a brand-new husband and a great apartment set us off on the right foot.\u201d But after a year, the couple wanted to see some trees and save some money, and it so happened that a cast mate from \u201cGrease\u201d was vacating her one-bedroom rental and looking for someone to take over the lease. Ms. Osnes and Mr. Johnson were willing and eager. \u201cWe were ready for a change. We were ready for the New York experience,\u201d said Ms. Osnes, who wasn\u2019t sure initially just how much of that New York experience she really wanted. \u201cWhen we lived in the high-rise and I went to visit friends in walk-ups, I thought to myself, \u2018I will never do this. Why would anyone live like this?\u2019 And then, a year later, I found myself living in a five-flight walk-up. It\u2019s funny how your attitudes change the longer you live here.\u201d Ms. Osnes and Mr. Johnson exude a sunny optimism, a can-do and make-do spirit. Faced with less than meager work space in the kitchen \u2014 and both avid cooks \u2014 they installed a tiny drop-down wood counter in the living room. Eight for Thanksgiving? Easy. And with little wall space to hang show posters and a certain disinclination to bring her work home, Ms. Osnes went with show magnets instead. They\u2019re neatly lined up on the refrigerator door. The apartment is furnished mostly with pieces the couple had on their wedding registry and hauled to New York from Minnesota. They\u2019ve since replaced the sofa and bought an accent chair, both gray, as well as an off-white rug, and they recently hired Mike Harrison, an interior designer, to add some polish. Mr. Harrison successfully pushed for more throw pillows on the sofa, painted an accent wall colonial blue, hung a round mirror on the brick wall to give the living room more depth, and moved around a few pieces of art. But he knew better than to mess with the liquor cabinet, which is the domain of Mr. Johnson (his wife drinks nothing stronger than tea). Mr. Harrison also stayed away from the wall unit, which holds Ms. Osnes\u2019s very special property: 10 binders of Playbills (arranged chronologically, starting with the \u201cMan of La Mancha\u201d Broadway revival she saw during a trip to New York as a high school student in 2003) and a selection of board games, including Yahtzee, Life, Sorry, Scrabble and Clue. Be warned: Ms. Osnes takes her Scrabble very, very seriously. \u201cLaura is incredibly talented at it, but she doesn\u2019t want to brag,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, adding, \u201cI no longer play Clue with her; I know what the outcome is going to be.\u201d As soon as the weather turns fine, the fun and games move to the deck. Early on, the couple had it resurfaced and bought a grill. Now, a favorite handmade rug from the Citizenry, a home goods website, has come outdoors for the season. \u201cEven though other people around us have decks, it still feels really private,\u201d Ms. Osnes said. \u201cWe love having friends over, and when Nate grills, our place becomes a real hang.\u201d Because they live on the top floor, it is sometimes easy for Ms. Osnes to forget the building has other occupants, so she might just burst into song. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll see people in the hall and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, we heard you singing yesterday,\u2019\u201d Ms. Osnes said. \u2018And I\u2019m like, \u2018I am so sorry.\u2019 And they\u2019re always very nice and say, \u2018No, we love it.\u2019\u201d Of course they love it.
