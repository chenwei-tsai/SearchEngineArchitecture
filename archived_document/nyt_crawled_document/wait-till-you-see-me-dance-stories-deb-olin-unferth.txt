{"text": "WAIT TILL YOU SEE ME DANCE Stories By Deb Olin Unferth 190 pp. Graywolf Press. Paper, $16. A teacher proposes a game to her adult-education students: \u201cLet\u2019s each tell the story of the worst thing that\u2019s happened to us.\u201d So popular is this activity that it becomes a regular part of the class, until one night a student tells a story so astounding that the tradition ends with his tale. (It features a rectal thermometer.) This is the plot of \u201cVoltaire Night,\u201d which appears in Deb Olin Unferth\u2019s fourth book and second story collection, \u201cWait Till You See Me Dance.\u201d Many of its 39 offbeat entries, which alternate between longer tour de force tales and flash fiction, could serve as contenders in a so-called Voltaire night. They\u2019re populated by jilted lovers and spurned mothers; moody armed teenagers; desperate working stiffs; irritable babies; even a woman who is \u201cbecoming a thoroughly unlikable person\u201d \u2014 in short, people on the brink of emotional, physical, psychological and/or financial ruin. This assemblage of down-and-out moments is delivered with a wit and concision reminiscent of Lydia Davis and Diane Williams, a wry intelligence and keen irony that don\u2019t prevent Unferth\u2019s prose from offering deep emotional intimacy. Sharply exposing her characters\u2019 shortcomings, she\u2019s just as meticulous in revealing their suffering. We may laugh at them, but ultimately we ache along with them. The struggle to be good is central to many of these stories, never mind that the characters\u2019 good intentions are often misdirected or self-serving. When the cynical teacher of an English class for \u201clast-chance\u201d students becomes a secret advocate for its weakest member, she admits that her valiant efforts on his behalf aren\u2019t untarnished by selfishness: \u201cIt may seem like I was being heroic here, trying to save this kid, but the truth is I was just grateful to be feeling something.\u201d This toggling between bitterness and tenderness is a dynamic force in Unferth\u2019s work. In a musing typical of Unferth\u2019s protagonists, the recovering alcoholic mother in \u201cPet\u201d \u2014 while contemplating a bathroom covered in the waste of the turtles upon which she has been showering the attention her teenage son refuses \u2014 observes that she possesses \u201cthe opposite of insight\u201d and is \u201cdoomed to middling livelihood at best, certain solitude, early illness, weakness, not-quite poverty, strained relations with her son, relatives who don\u2019t really like her taking care of her when she is old.\u201d Then she notices the turtle droppings in her hair. Situating such characters at the brink, Unferth tinges even trivial moments of anxiety with a sense of existential crisis. Yet the darker the book tilts, the more hilarious it becomes. The woman who perceives her increasing unlikability \u201cfixed herself on being likable for the next four seconds (more than that was impossible).\u201d Unferth frequently uses parentheticals like this to transform neutral statements into knives, to bestow the bite of irony on a clich\u00e9: \u201cShe and her mother would have the time of their lives (well, not exactly, but it would have its moments).\u201d Unferth\u2019s book is rich with surprises, small and large. She is equally adept at deadpan realism and postmodern playfulness, deploying stories that take the form of lists, plot summaries and dirty jokes. Her miniature stories are often wickedly insightful. In the absurd yet close-to-home parable \u201cOnline,\u201d a woman decides to reduce her internet time from 24 hours a day to two, but \u201cshe can\u2019t remember what there is to do in the world other than study screens of various sizes with various intentions.\u201d In Unferth\u2019s most stunning orchestration, \u201cThe First Full Thought of Her Life,\u201d the narrative dives into many different points of view as it evokes the moment when a shooter trains his gun on a child climbing a sand dune. This impossibly disturbing subject matter is served well by \u2014 perhaps even demands \u2014 the innovative and capacious structure Unferth has given it. In the critical climactic instant, we find ourselves transported to a descending airplane below which \u201cthe glinting waves were like spilled jewels or glowing undersea algae or floating space junk.\u201d The presence of optimism in the face of likely doom creates cognitive dissonance in this story and many others, leaving Unferth\u2019s readers on uncertain footing: Are we supposed to be hopeful, or are we supposed to sink further into despair? A central concern running throughout the collection is anxiety about the act of storytelling itself. Reading about writers writing about writing can be a wearying proposition, but in Unferth\u2019s hands this endeavor feels expansive rather than myopic, thanks to her perceptive humor and her fierce way of tussling with her thoughts. Her disillusionment with the act of writing runs neck and neck with her belief in the act of writing. Telling stories, sharing the darkest things inside and outside oneself, may, she suggests, be the only possible path to some sort of relief. Yet this is countered by an element of scorn directed at herself, as a writer, for presuming anything about her vocation. These stories-that-doubt-the-worthiness-of-stories culminate in the one-paragraph piece \u201cDraft,\u201d in which a writer discovers that the scraps of her work in progress are \u201cmore racket than song, more stones than statue, more rags than rug.\u201d Yet even as she despairs over these fragments, she delivers her lament with exquisite precision and rhythm. Again and again in these pages, Unferth swerves from the mundane to the extraordinary, from biting to soaringly celebratory, often in a single sentence. If these are her scraps, I\u2019ll take them \u2014 the racket, the stones, the rags.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/books/review/wait-till-you-see-me-dance-stories-deb-olin-unferth.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:26-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:26-04:00", "abstract": "The down-and-out moments in Deb Unferth\u2019s story collection, \u201cWait Till You See Me Dance,\u201d manage to be both witty and emotional intimate.", "title": "A Collection of Tales Large and Small Finds Humor Among the Ruins"}
