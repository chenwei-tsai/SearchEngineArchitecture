April is National Poetry Month. And \u201cNew York is the birthplace of the American voice,\u201d according to our New York State poet laureate, Yusef Komunyakaa. (He\u2019s actually from Louisiana and has lived in other states but calls New York the birthplace of American poetry because it was home to Walt Whitman.) When we asked Mr. Komunyakaa, who began his two-year term in 2016, what the New York State poet position entailed, he told us, \u201clovingly embracing poetry.\u201d Mr. Komunyakaa, the 11th state poet, teaches poetry at New York University, gives readings at local high schools and hosts discussions across the state. He has also shared and written poetry with military veterans and with inmates at Rikers Island. Poetry is still very much \u201calive and well,\u201d he said, and plays a particularly important role today in America and other democracies. \u201cPoetry poses questions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes they\u2019re not provocative or even metaphysical, but they are everyday questions about life and death that force us to confront the reality of the present as well as the future.\u201d Mr. Komunyakaa, 70, has been writing and reading poetry since he was a boy. Tennyson, Longfellow, Dunbar, Hughes and Hayden have all been part of his pursuit and growth. And, of course, Whitman. Like Whitman\u2019s writing, Mr. Komunyakaa\u2019s poetry has been shaped by the city we call home. Take, for example, his poem, \u201cThe Last Bohemian of Avenue A.\u201d The book-length piece, still a work in progress, captures the tenor and psyche of the Lower East Side: the underbelly and exuberance that is New York. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I knew so much about New York until I started writing that poem,\u201d he said. Next year, Mr. Komunyakaa will help choose his successor. But in the meantime, here\u2019s his advice to aspiring poets: \u201cAttempt to write every day, to read everything, to listen, to be in the world, to challenge ideas and to question ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just poetry; it\u2019s the experience of inquiry.\u201d He added: \u201cBe aware of the small things in the world, not necessarily the monumental things. The small things add up to a monumental reality.\u201d Here\u2019s what else is happening: An ode to the atmosphere: Gray clouds rolling in Dew and dancing sewer steam High near 62 \u2022 Train derailments have set off alarms over Amtrak\u2019s management of Pennsylvania Station, its safety record and the railroad\u2019s perennial funding problems.
