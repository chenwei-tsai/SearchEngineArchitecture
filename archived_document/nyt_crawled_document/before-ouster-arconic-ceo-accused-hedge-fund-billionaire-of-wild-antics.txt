But one of the most contentious showdowns between an activist hedge fund and a public company just got bizarre. When Klaus Kleinfeld stepped down as the chairman and chief executive of Arconic on Monday, the company said his departure was for showing \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in sending a letter to the big hedge fund that had been calling for his ouster. As it turns out, the letter in question was quite a bit stranger than that. The letter that Mr. Kleinfeld sent to Paul E. Singer, the billionaire founder of Elliott Management, on April 11 made elliptical references to the investor\u2019s 2006 trip to the World Cup soccer championship in Berlin and insinuated knowledge of \u201cthe great time\u201d that Mr. Singer had. The missive \u2014 accompanied by a soccer ball supposedly from the tournament \u2014 was interpreted by Elliott as a veiled attempt to intimidate Mr. Singer based on false premises, and the hedge fund notified Arconic\u2019s board about the communication. Within a week, Mr. Kleinfeld ended his nearly decade-long tenure as chief executive of Arconic and the company it was spun out of, Alcoa. Mr. Kleinfeld\u2019s letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, drips with sarcasm. He describes enjoying \u201cthe unique attention and unlimited pleasure of multiple exchanges\u201d with Elliott, whose monthslong activist campaign repeatedly highlighted Mr. Kleinfeld\u2019s shortcomings as chief executive of Arconic. But it is when Mr. Kleinfeld\u2019s thoughts turn to soccer that the letter takes a peculiar turn. Mr. Kleinfeld implies that he has learned of Mr. Singer\u2019s purported antics during the 2006 visit to the soccer championship. No specific allegations are leveled, but Mr. Kleinfeld references a Native American feather headdress and a rendition of \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d performed in a fountain. Though Mr. Singer is well-known on Wall Street for his soccer fandom, his hedge fund has contended that there is no truth to the letter\u2019s insinuations. The next day, Elliott\u2019s general counsel wrote to Arconic\u2019s board, notifying the directors of the letter and the soccer ball sent to the hedge fund\u2019s offices. \u201cAssuming therefore that the letter is from Dr. Kleinfeld, we find it to be an irresponsible and inappropriate communication,\u201d the lawyer, Richard B. Zabel, wrote in that letter. \u201cWhile much of what it says doesn\u2019t make sense, we do understand Dr. Kleinfeld to be making veiled suggestions that he might intimidate or extort Mr. Singer based on Mr. Singer\u2019s family trip to Germany in 2006 when he attended the World Cup.\u201d It is not clear whether Arconic replied to that letter. But by April 17, the company said that Mr. Kleinfeld was leaving the company by \u201cmutual consent.\u201d That face-saving arrangement did not sit well with Elliott, which sent another letter to Arconic\u2019s directors criticizing the move as \u201cinsensitive to Mr. Singer, who is a victim of this conduct.\u201d A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment beyond the letters. Representatives for Arconic and Mr. Kleinfeld were not immediately available for comment. In announcing Mr. Kleinfeld\u2019s departure, Arconic threw down a gauntlet at its tormentor, arguing that \u201cit is Elliott Management\u2019s decision whether to continue to burden Arconic and its shareholders with its highly disruptive and distracting proxy fight.\u201d The hedge fund responded that it still wants four seats on Arconic\u2019s board.", "item_type": "Article"}
