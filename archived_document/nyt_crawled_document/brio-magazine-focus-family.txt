{"text": "Teenage girls who dislike the frank sexuality of Cosmopolitan and the left-leaning politics of Teen Vogue but still want a magazine to give them tips on fashion and hairstyles (not to mention advice on abstinence) are in luck. This month Focus on the Family has relaunched Brio, a glossy teen magazine shut down in 2009. The organization\u2019s conservative Christian ethos animates Brio, which its publisher, Bob DeMoss, said has so far attracted over 56,000 subscribers through ads sent directly to Focus supporters. Its goal is to address the topics found in mainstream teen magazines from \u201ca biblical worldview,\u201d Mr. DeMoss said. Focus on the Family has long been known for its opposition to abortion, sex outside of marriage and rights for transgender and gay people, who it has said can \u201cleave\u201d homosexuality or change their gender identity by embracing Jesus Christ. But within the evangelical community, its name is synonymous for many with parenting tips like those found in \u201cDare to Discipline,\u201d the 1970 book by its founder, James Dobson. \u201cWhat would the Bible have to say about bullying or peace-making or peer pressure or sexual purity?\u201d Mr. DeMoss said. \u201cFocus on the Family would say and Brio would reflect: \u2018Hey, sex was God\u2019s idea so why not follow the game plan that he laid out in the Bible?\u2019 And you\u2019re not going to get that in the pages of \u2018Seventeen,\u2019 let\u2019s be clear.\u201d Indeed, a quick flip through back issues of Brio quickly reveals how different it is from other teen magazines, with covers featuring stars like Selena Gomez and breathless updates on Kylie Jenner\u2019s dating life. The only celebrities to grace Brio\u2019s cover are those who espouse the Christian worldview of Focus on the Family, like the 19-year-old \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Sadie Robertson, who appears on its May cover and has marketed a line of \u201cdaddy-approved\u201d prom dresses. It has also promoted Christian musicians like Kyle Matthews and urged readers to shun singers like Eminem (a music columnist once advised readers to seek guidance from Philippians 4:8 and 1 Thessalonians 5:21-22 instead). An article in the first issue focuses on Bruno Mars. And while Teen Vogue recently published a guide to gifts you can buy a friend after an abortion, Brio has featured reader testimonials on how to avoid the temptations of premarital sex (\u201cI began struggling to keep my thoughts godly when Satan tried to draw me out of my purity,\u201d wrote Leah, age 16, in 2009.) The magazine\u2019s promotional materials are directed more at adults shopping for young people than at teenagers themselves. That\u2019s because nostalgia is an important ingredient in the magazine\u2019s relaunch, said Susan B. Ridgely, a professor of Religious Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cKids who grew up with Candace Cameron are now parents,\u201d she said, referring to the \u201cFull House\u201d star who was the magazine\u2019s March 1992 cover girl. \u201cJust like Netflix is trying to get those viewers with \u2018Fuller House,\u2019 Focus on the Family may be trying to get them with the return of Brio.\u201d The magazine had roughly 260,000 subscribers at the end of its 19-year print run in 2009, Mr. DeMoss said, making it one of Focus on the Family\u2019s top-selling publications. The relaunched version is one of five magazines published by the group, which also draws almost 6.3 million listeners a week on over 1,000 American radio stations. Sorcha Brophy, a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh who grew up reading Brio, said the magazine aims to \u201cnormalize being a Christian teen\u201d by telling readers it can be cool to go to church and shun drugs and partying. But she said its emphasis on moral uprightness can also create a lot of pressure. As an example, Ms. Brophy pointed to a feature she encountered during her research: a pop culture quiz that deducted points from a reader\u2019s score for correctly answered questions about mainstream music videos and celebrity gossip. \u201cThere\u2019s no suggestion in the magazine that teenagers should completely remove themselves from pop culture and mainstream society, but at the same time there is an expectation of constant vigilance about how you engage with those things and about what you\u2019re consuming and how you\u2019re consuming it,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of work is expected out of teenage readers.\u201d Ms. Ridgely said the magazine has traditionally \u201cmodeled what Focus sees as the right kind of behavior\u201d and avoided mentioning things of which it disapproves. It may be unlikely to mention abortion at all unless it profiled \u201ca young woman with a young baby and everything is going swimmingly,\u201d she said. \u201cWith homosexuality, for girls especially, lesbianism almost never comes up in any of their material. Girls aren\u2019t depicted as people with a sex drive. Their whole job is to keep young boys\u2019 sex drive under control.\u201d Mr. DeMoss, a writer and longtime \u201cyouth culture specialist\u201d who is vice president for content development at Focus on the Family, agreed that the new incarnation of Brio was unlikely to cover gay or transgender issues, even though they have become far more socially accepted since Brio\u2019s first issue in 1990. For example, he said, Brio probably would not have joined other magazines in profiling the reality star Caitlyn Jenner when she came out as transgender last year. \u201cIf those topics ever come up in the pages of Brio they will be handled in a non-shaming, grace-filled, welcoming \u2014 and by welcoming I don\u2019t mean \u2018hey, we have no standards\u2019 \u2014 way,\u201d Mr. DeMoss said. And what are those standards? \u201cWe use the Bible as a standard,\u201d he replied, before quickly changing the subject to topics like music reviews and human trafficking. When it was suggested that he was avoiding the topic, Mr. DeMoss laughed and said \u201cwe have more than one instrument in the band.\u201d He elaborated, \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve read, if you take all the transgender, all the L.G.B.T., you know, community and the gender fluid and, you know, that entire population \u2014 you\u2019re looking at maybe 3 to 5 percent of the entire population of the United States,\u201d a figure broadly in line with a 2012 Gallup survey. \u201cWe would rather communicate to the 95 percent or so who are not dialed into that as a regular kind of thing,\u201d Mr. DeMoss said. The magazine has no digital plans, Mr. DeMoss said, and costs about $20 per year for 10 print issues. The name means \u201cvigor, full of life,\u201d Focus on the Family explains on its site, promising a mix of entertainment and do-it-yourself features along with \u201cexciting, vivacious, faith-based articles\u201d and \u201cmore fuel to energize their life.\u201d The first copies should arrive in the mail this week.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/business/media/brio-magazine-focus-family.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T07:52:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T07:52:10-04:00", "abstract": "Pitched as a conservative alternative to Teen Vogue and Seventeen, it mixes tips on fashion and abstinence with profiles of Christian stars.", "title": "Focus on the Family Revives Brio, a Magazine for Teenage Girls"}
