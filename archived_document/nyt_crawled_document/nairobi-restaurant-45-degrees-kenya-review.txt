My chef said to me: \u2018Consider yourself blessed that people come to you for a meal. So imagine that every meal you cook is going to be their last.\u2019\u201d Mr. Sena-Akoto seems to take that to heart with his philosophy of providing \u201cgood, healthy, nourishing food\u201d in an environment that is \u201cwarm, rustic, welcoming and natural.\u201d In Kenya, that isn\u2019t always easy. Forty-Five Degrees Kitchen, which opened in late 2015, prides itself on sourcing locally \u2014 very locally. Mr. Sena-Akoto gets his chickens from a woman down the road, lamb from a farm in Naivasha and carrots, beets, cucumbers, arugula and bok choy from a garden behind his parking lot. He calls fishermen on Kenya\u2019s coast who catch what he needs, pack it on ice and send it to Nairobi on an overnight bus. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy operation,\u201d said Rose Wahome, his wife and co-owner of the restaurant. \u201cSometimes they tell us, \u2018Oh, the moon was out and the fish could see us and they were hiding.\u2019 So no fish. And guess what? We have customers coming.\u201d Nairobi has a handful of fine-dining restaurants, many buried deep within fancy hotels. But 45 Degrees Kitchen (named after the angle at which many chefs sharpen their knives) sits on a tree-lined street on the grounds of an old chicken farm. Because Nairobi has a dreamy climate, most of the 70 seats are outside. On a recent night, my wife and I sat down under the stars for the standard four-course meal, starting with a very fresh arugula and beet salad. Next came spinach ravioli, building up to the Tuscan lamb \u2014 one of the best pieces of meat I have eaten in Kenya. For dessert, Mr. Sena-Akoto presented a sampler of flourless chocolate cake, tiramis\u00f9 and mango parfait. Compact, exuberant and chatty, Mr. Sena-Akoto explained that he tries to hire locally, too. \u201cMany of my waiters have never been waited on,\u201d he said. So he takes his team of young Kenyans to other restaurants to sit down and learn how to enjoy a good meal. It seemed to work. The service for our dinner was meticulous without being overbearing, and 45 Degrees Kitchen is now one of my favorite restaurants in this part of the world.
