{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s America first, you better believe it,\u201d President Trump said, standing over a tool cabinet at the Snap-On Tools headquarters in Kenosha, Wis., where he signed his \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order this month to favor American companies for federal contracts. And with that, Mr. Trump staked claim to an issue that has become a pet cause for a group that, generally speaking, would just as soon wear a Power Rangers helmet as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat: the urban beards-and-selvage-jeans set who transformed the \u201cMade in U.S.A.\u201d clothing label into a men\u2019s wear status symbol over the past decade. In any other year, having the president as an ally might be considered a coup. With this president? Well, for brands that have staked their identity on \u201cMade in U.S.A.\u201d chic, it is complicated. \u201cPolitics has become extremely contentious and polarizing in this country, and we don\u2019t want our brand caught in the political crossfire,\u201d said Jacob Hurwitz, a founder of American Trench, a maker of fashion-forward outerwear and hosiery in Philadelphia that prominently displays the motto \u201cAlways American-Made\u201d on its website. \u201cTo be honest, we can\u2019t afford it.\u201d In fact, Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d order will have no tangible effect on the market for plaid shirts or hand-sewn leather hunting boots, since it concerns procurement policies by federal agencies, not purchases by individual consumers, on products like steel (it also aims to rework the visa program for foreign technical workers). Even so, the order helps cement the \u201cBuy American\u201d impulse with the protectionist \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies that Mr. Trump hammered away at on the campaign trail. To some on the political left, the president\u2019s appropriation of \u201cBuy American\u201d feels like a violation. \u201cBefore he co-opted it for his own gains, \u2018Made in the U.S.A.\u2019 was about celebrating craft and investing in quality, lasting garments, while also helping to revitalize a dying industry,\u201d said Brad Bennett, who writes the men\u2019s wear blog Well Spent, which focuses largely on premium American-made brands. \u201cNow, it\u2019s become just another platform for xenophobes and white nationalists.\u201d Others in this locavore men\u2019s wear subculture find it irksome that the president espouses American manufacturing while his branded apparel, as well as that of his daughter Ivanka, is  largely made in Asia. \u201cInstead of just blurting out ridiculous promises and false statements, he could easily make his ties, shirts and suits in the U.S.,\u201d said Chris Molnar, the founder of Goodlife, which makes its premium T-shirts and sweatshirts in Los Angeles. This is not to say that opinions are unanimous, especially among fashion brand owners who happened to have supported Mr. Trump. Todd Shelton, a designer who runs a namesake clothing label, recently moved production from China to East Rutherford, N.J., so he could closely oversee production of his jeans, shirts and sweaters. Mr. Shelton was recently quoted in The Los Angeles Times explaining his support for Mr. Trump. \u201cAs business owners, we\u2019ve heard support for \u2018Made in U.S.A.\u2019 before from politicians, but with Trump, it felt sincere,\u201d he said. (\u201cI\u2019m not a \u2018Trump guy\u2019 and certainly don\u2019t want to be known as one,\u201d Mr. Shelton added this week in an email, after his earlier quotation was criticized by some customers. \u201cI\u2019m pro-American manufacturing.\u201d) Even so, few in the industry have been willing to speak out in favor of the president. Shortly after the election, for example, New Balance \u2014 a brand cherished by many young urban creatives, in part because it still manufactures some of its shoes in the United States \u2014 landed in a social media firestorm after an executive was quoted in The Wall Street Journal saying, \u201cWe feel things are going to move in the right direction\u201d under Mr. Trump. The company issued a statement saying that the quotation had been taken out of context, and that it supported pro-American manufacturing policies of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, too. Similarly, L. L. Bean faced a storm of criticism after a donation by Linda Bean, a granddaughter of the company\u2019s founder, came to light, followed by a shout-out by the president on Twitter thanking her for her \u201cgreat support and courage.\u201d Shawn Gorman, the company\u2019s executive chairman, quickly amended that: \u201cWe stay out of politics,\u201d but the company nevertheless was added to Grab Your Wallet, a list of businesses that are said to have supported Mr. Trump in some fashion (a list that is, by the way, largely free of heritage-brand clothing companies). The message for many brands: Tread carefully. American Trench, for example, hired a writer to rework the \u201cAbout Us\u201d section on its website \u201cto remove anything that could be construed as making a statement that appealed more to one party or the other, and also make very clear that \u2018Made in America\u2019 for us is inclusive to all Americans, not exclusive,\u201d Mr. Hurwitz said. In less divided times, \u201cBuy American\u201d might seem like an issue that every American could rally behind. After all, 97 percent of apparel sold in the United States is now made overseas, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Who would not want to see at least some of those jobs trickle back? But these days, \u201cBuy American\u201d is not always a question of politics, but of economics. For many Americans, low cost is paramount. According to a poll last year by The Associated Press-GfK, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said they would prefer to buy American. But faced with a choice of $50 pants made abroad or $85 pants made domestically, 67 percent said they would buy the cheaper pair. There are still some affordably priced staples produced in America; Diamond Gusset, for example, sells several styles of jeans in the $60 to $70 range. But generally speaking, the brands that are left are premium ones that appeal to well-heeled cosmopolitans, customers who are willing to fork over $300 for some pairs of Red Wing boots and $165 for an handsomely cut oxford-cloth shirt from Gitman Bros. Vintage. \u201cWe have a customer base that can afford to make choices about garment provenance,\u201d said Bradley Schmidt, a founder of Cadet, a Brooklyn maker of military-inspired men\u2019s wear, most of it manufactured in the garment district in Manhattan. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel they would want to be associated with a brand that would align itself with the entire ethos behind \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019\u201d Many such premium brands got a big boost from the heritage chic look of recent years. That trend is, by most accounts, fading. But that does not mean \u201cMade in U.S.A.\u201d is dead, said Erik Schnakenberg, a founder of the denim-and-staples brand Buck Mason, based in Los Angeles. When the company was founded three years ago, \u201cwe were dead set on making everything here,\u201d Mr. Schnakenberg said. What they found, though, is that \u201cAmerican-made\u201d is less about marketing hype than about making hard choices involving quality versus cost. \u201cBeing close to your production is important,\u201d he said. \u201cTurnaround is faster, and quality improves because you can really keep an eye one what\u2019s going on.\u201d Then again, the issue that the president seems to be papering over, Mr. Schnakenberg said, is that there is really no such thing as \u201cAmerican\u201d in the era of a global supply chain. Buck Mason jeans, which start at $135, are cut and sewn in Los Angeles, but the denim is Japanese, with hardware from China and dyes from India. \u201cAmerican exceptionalism is dead when it comes to apparel manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Schnakenberg added. \u201cIf we want to make great things here, we need to partner with the best, whether they\u2019re down the street or across the pond.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/fashion/trends/trump-buy-american-heritage-brands.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T00:03:58-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T00:00:07-04:00", "abstract": "A battle cry by the president falls flat with some who were ahead of the curve on heritage brands.", "title": "Trump\u2019s \u2018Buy American\u2019 Push Ruffles Some Fashion Feathers"}
