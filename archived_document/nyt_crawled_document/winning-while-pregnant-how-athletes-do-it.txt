{"text": "The Snapchat image of Serena Williams\u2019s baby bump with the caption \u201c20 weeks\u201d was deleted shortly after it appeared last week, but anyone could do the math: when Ms. Williams won her 23rd Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open on Jan. 28, she was eight weeks pregnant. And even her coach had no idea. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feat,\u201d said Dr. Laura Riley, director of labor and delivery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cPeople should give her credit for who she is, which is an amazing athlete.\u201d Many women are bone-tired at eight weeks of pregnancy, and hunkered over the toilet with morning sickness. Many go to bed early. A woman\u2019s\u2019 body is going through profound changes as a resident alien the size of a kidney bean settles into her uterus and makes him or herself comfortable. Progesterone \u2014 which surges during pregnancy \u2014 is blamed for the extreme fatigue many women experience. Estrogen and growth factors also surge early in pregnancy. The hormonal changes trigger a cascade of physiological changes. By the fifth week of gestation, the pregnant woman\u2019s cardiovascular system has begun to change Her total blood volume will increase by 35 to 45 percent over the course of the nine months \u2014 as will the total number of red blood cells. With each heartbeat, she pumps out more blood, and she breathes faster. The changes also affect the kidneys, meaning more frequent bathroom runs. Seven to eight weeks in, up to 80 percent of pregnant women have nausea that can be quite severe and occurs day and night (\u201cmorning sickness\u201d is a misnomer, doctors say). So how did Ms. Williams do it? \u201cI\u2019m sure there were moments she had to push through fatigue. But she had a job to do, she didn\u2019t give in, she pulled out all the stops and got the job done,\u201d Dr. Riley said. \u201cA lot of women do that. They have to work.\u201d At the TED 2017 Conference in Vancouver this week, Ms. Williams revealed that she learned of her pregnancy before the tournament began. \u201cI was nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Can I play? I had a lot of questions.\u201d She continued: \u201cYou hear all these stories about people when they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 they get sick, they get really tired, really stressed out.\u201d \u201cI knew that at that moment, it was important for me to just focus,\u201d she said. \u201cI really felt like I didn\u2019t have time to deal with any extra emotions \u2014 any extra anything.\u201d Ms. Williams added: \u201cPregnant or not, no one knew. Every tournament where I show up, I\u2019m expected to win.\u201d James Pivarnik, a professor of kinesiology at Michigan State University who has studied the effects of exercise on pregnancy, said research on top athletes is limited, but his hypothesis is that elite athletes are more resilient than most people. \u201cThese women are different. They can recover from incredible stresses that they put themselves through on a daily basis for their entire lives,\u201d Dr. Pivarnik said. \u201cOne of the reasons they can hit a tennis ball really hard is that they can recover. It\u2019s the people who can recover who make it to that level.\u201d Dr. Riley said Ms. Williams\u2019s timing was impeccable because there is no reason to avoid competing during early pregnancy; the heavy lifting of pregnancy starts later, around 20 weeks. (Ms. Williams, who announced her engagement to Alexis Ohanian, a businessman, in December, has not played a match since the Australian Open, and a spokeswoman said she will not return to the circuit until 2018). Dr. Riley said: \u201cMy first thought when I heard was, \u2018Oh my goodness, smart woman, your timing was perfect: It\u2019s early in pregnancy and there\u2019s nothing to do but sit tight and wait and keep your fingers crossed all goes well.\u2019 Nothing she did was going to change that \u2014 so why not go out and win the Australian Open?\u201d Dr. Raul Artal, a professor emeritus of obstetrics and women\u2019s health at St. Louis University, said some research has suggested that early pregnancy may even offer an endurance advantage to athletes as a result of the increase in oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Other athletes who have competed while pregnant include the beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh Jennings, who was five weeks pregnant when she won a gold medal in the 2012 London Olympics. The archers Khatuna Lorig and Cornelia Pfohl were pregnant when they won bronze medals for the Soviet Union and Germany in 1992 and 2000, respectively. Changes that occur midpregnancy, around 20 weeks\u2019 gestation, may interfere with competitive sports. Dehydration can trigger uterine contractions. Joints become more flexible and lax, increasing the risk of joint strains and injuries. And a woman\u2019s center of gravity changes, affecting balance. While pregnancy is not the time to start a strenuous exercise program, physicians generally encourage women to remain physically active. Contact sports like ice hockey are discouraged, but the days of advising pregnant women to avoid exercise are gone. Physical activity guidelines are the same for pregnant and nonpregnant women, and those who have been sedentary are encouraged to take up moderate activities like walking. Regular moderate physical activity can help reduce excessive weight gain during pregnancy and curbs the risk of complications like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. \u201cConventional wisdom years and years ago was to tell women, \u2018you\u2019re pregnant, stay off your feet, put your feet up,\u2019\u201d Dr. Riley said. But now, unless there are specific reasons not to exercise, she said, \u201cWe encourage it, in moderation.\u201d The 35-year-old Ms. Williams said she plans to return to competitive tennis after her pregnancy. \u201cI definitely plan on coming back \u2014 I\u2019m not done yet,\u201d Ms. Williams said at the Vancouver conference. \u201cThis is just a new part of my life. My baby is going to be in the stands, hopefully cheering for me and not crying too much.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/well/move/winning-while-pregnant-how-athletes-do-it.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Well", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T06:00:04-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T06:00:04-04:00", "abstract": "Serena Williams won the Australian Open in her eighth week of pregnancy, a time when many women are dead tired and suffering from morning sickness.", "title": "Winning While Pregnant: How Athletes Do It"}
