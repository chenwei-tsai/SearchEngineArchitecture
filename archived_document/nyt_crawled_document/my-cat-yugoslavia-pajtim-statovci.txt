Which of a society\u2019s members are extended the privilege of hoping and dreaming? This question lies at the heart of the Kosovo-born Finnish writer Pajtim Statovci\u2019s internationally acclaimed debut, \u201cMy Cat Yugoslavia,\u201d a strange, haunting and utterly original exploration of displacement and desire. Statovci interweaves the stories of Emine, a young Kosovan bride, and her son, Bekim, whom the aftershocks of exile continue to roil three decades after her fateful wedding to his father. Bekim is a studious gay loner isolated by anxiety, sexuality and the struggle of having grown up a refugee in Finland. Despite a childhood history with ophidiophobic nightmares, he buys a boa constrictor and sets it loose in his apartment. The snake takes up residence under his sofa, driving away his few human visitors, and quickly adopts strangely companionable behaviors more befitting a dog than a reptile. An urgent longing for love belies Bekim\u2019s inscrutability. We find echoes of that same longing in Emine\u2019s girlhood reminiscences. She is a fiercely intelligent daydreamer at odds with her strict and superstitious father. In one of the novel\u2019s most affecting passages, she realizes that the objective of her education has always been to make her a more suitable wife; she has \u201cnever heard of a single female politician, a female teacher or lawyer.\u201d Having reconciled that she can no longer allow herself to dream, she wonders what she can hope for instead. Understanding that it can only be a handsome, generous husband, she promptly throws up. Her life is upended by a fleeting roadside encounter with Bajram, a rou\u00e9 from the neighboring village who asks for her hand in marriage on what is essentially a whim. Throughout their lives, mother and son share echoing preoccupations with domesticity and sensuality, and are particularly attentive to the world\u2019s tactile and olfactory details. They share, too, a steadfast refusal to give up the truth of their inner selves in the face of violent and violating masculinity. At a gay bar one evening, Bekim falls under the spell of a singing, dancing cat. I will admit to being more than a little skeptical of this character, loyal as I am to Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s \u201cThe Master and Margarita\u201d and its most iconic figure: Behemoth, that formidable hedonist against whom all fictional felines must be measured. I am happy to report that Statovci\u2019s cat manages to mark its own literary turf. Its ostentatiousness and absurdity make Behemoth look comparably stable. This cat \u2014 a vainglorious, labile, impulsively abusive bigot, in whom Bajram\u2019s judgment and Bekim\u2019s own worst fears combine \u2014 captivates Bekim. After he allows it to move in with him, things quickly go wrong, forcing him to take stock of his past and reimagine his future. Such a dazzling figure can make other aspects of a narrative seem tame. At certain points, the novel loses some of its wild, wonderful energy. Nuanced interiority gives way to action \u2014 sometimes, unnecessarily, in the third person. In an effort to compress time, Statovci is forced to paint Emine\u2019s and Bekim\u2019s respective heartbreaks \u2014 displacement; poverty; shame; the xenophobia of their Finnish neighbors; the impregnability of new languages and customs; the eventual feeling that one belongs to neither one\u2019s old nor new country \u2014 in broad and recognizable strokes. These obstacles would be better served by the same vivid detailing with which Emine\u2019s wedding preparations and Bekim\u2019s eventual chance at happiness are rendered. But it is faint criticism to say there should be more of a book, and Statovci\u2019s literary gifts are prodigious. His sentences are lean and precise. He defies expectation, denies explanation, and excels at the most difficult aspect of storytelling: building a complex humanity for even his most deplorable characters. He does not pretend to offer a journey that every reader will appreciate. But that is part of his magic, and in all the ways that matter, \u201cMy Cat Yugoslavia\u201d is a marvel, a remarkable achievement, and a world apart from anything you are likely to read this year.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T05:00:29-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/my-cat-yugoslavia-pajtim-statovci.html", "item_type": "Article"}
