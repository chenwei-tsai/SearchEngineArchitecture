{"text": "Our guide to new art shows \u2014 and some that will be closing soon. \u2018BLACK POWER!\u2019 at Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (through Dec. 30). Given the economic, environmental and social policies emanating from the White House, the United States could be headed for its most dynamic era of public resistance since the 1960s. And if you\u2019re searching for cultural models from the past, even flawed ones, that effectively brought a message of social change into the street, the schools and the workplace, you\u2019ll do well to check out this vivid documentary show about a cultural movement that broadened activist art to embrace public murals, fashion and poetry; and protest demonstrations that had the visual allure, choreographic rigor and emotional weight of theater.

This unshowy New York painter has spent 30 years refining her visions of rural Connecticut and the coast of New England, and six dozen of her concentrated paintings will force you to slow down, look hard and find the profound in the everyday. Ms. Gallace\u2019s best works depict houses, barns or cabanas, often missing their windows and pared down to simple polygons; the landscapes they lie in, by contrast, can be worked so hard they appear almost finger-painted. Each one is as sober and strange as a Morandi still life, and an antidote to an art world lately beholden to spectacle.

The work in this show, dating from the end of World War II to the beginning of second-wave feminism, is all abstract and all by women. And although it starts in what feels like honorable-mention mode \u2014 Lee Krasner is here, for instance, but not in the museum\u2019s permanent galleries of Abstract Expressionism \u2014 it doesn\u2019t stay there. Instead, it goes for difference and stays with it, introducing us to artists of diverse geographic and ethnic backgrounds whom we may not know, or have an institutional context for. Among them are such luminaries, present and past, as Etel Adnan, Ruth Asawa, Lina Bo Bardi, Bela Kolarova, Anne Ryan and Lenore Tawney.

What did second-wave feminism, a movement conceived largely by white women, have to offer African-American women in a country where, as late as the 1960s, de facto slavery still existed? This is one of the questions asked by a moving, spare-looking group exhibition that takes a textured view of political history \u2014 a history that is gaining fresh importance in the present, when the civil rights gains, including feminist gains, of the past half-century appear to be up for grabs. (Cotter)718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org \u2018MARILYN MINTER: PRETTY/DIRTY\u2019 at the Brooklyn Museum (closes on May 7). This peripatetic but thoroughly engrossing survey reveals an artist who has operated for more than 30 years in the gap defined by feminism, painting and popular culture. Her provocative images borrow from fashion, advertising, burlesque and pornography; push the unpromising 1960s trend of Photo Realism into new areas of gorgeousness and abstraction; and explore the ways women do and do not own their bodies. (Roberta Smith)718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org \u2018PERPETUAL REVOLUTION: THE IMAGE AND SOCIAL CHANGE\u2019 at the International Center of Photography (through May 7). The International Center of Photography opened in 1974 as a showcase for socially concerned picture making, and has stayed on mission, even as photographic technology has expanded to encompass the internet. This exhibition reflects those shifts. It\u2019s as purposely topical as anything the center has done, with six thematic sections focused on climate change, immigration, gender issues, racial turmoil, terrorism and the 2016 presidential election. At the same time, it looks different from shows past, as digital media \u2014 smartphone videos, Twitter outtakes, Instagram feeds \u2014 outnumber photographic prints.

New Yorkers, who live in a world shaped by advertising, are suckers for self-transformation. In a choice between changing body or mind, changing the body is easier. And the easiest feature to change is skin, that blank canvas just waiting to be colored, stained or drawn on. That\u2019s what we see happening repeatedly, imaginatively and usually permanently in this jampacked survey of epidermal Americana, past and present.
