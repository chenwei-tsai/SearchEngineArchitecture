{"text": "At the start of \u201cCatastrophe,\u201d Sharon (an Irish schoolteacher played by Sharon Horgan) and Rob (an American ad man played by Rob Delaney) meet in a London bar and proceed to have loads of sex, most of it unprotected. \u201cA terrible thing has happened,\u201d he tells her after learning that their six-night bacchanal has resulted in pregnancy. \u201cLet\u2019s make the best of it.\u201d And with that, one of television\u2019s funniest, filthiest, most realistic takes on the sweet mess of coupledom and parenting was born. Ms. Horgan, 46, the Irish writer and actress, gave raw, ribald voice to the tumult of relationships. She even made nursing bras erotic. And she knows whence she writes: Now a mother of two daughters, she discovered she was pregnant six months into dating her husband, Jeremy Rainbird, an ad man at the time. Nope, it wasn\u2019t planned. Season 3 of \u201cCatastrophe,\u201d debuting Friday, April 28, on Amazon, finds the spouses exactly where they left off \u2014 with a receipt for a Plan B pill and a guilty conscience \u2014 and adds secret drinking, employment woes and financial struggles to the mire. \u201cWe wanted to make their life hard, not just for the fun of watching people having to deal with that but also because that feels like reflective of what\u2019s happening in the world at the moment,\u201d said Ms. Horgan, who lives in London but was speaking by phone from Atlanta, where she is shooting a movie. \u201cThings are getting tougher, and people are having to dig deep.\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Carrie Fisher played Rob\u2019s  blunt, manipulative mom, with whom Sharon shares a mutual aversion. How are you dealing with her death? Carrie is hugely in Episode 6. Even though it\u2019s just one episode, her presence is felt a lot more. It\u2019s fun writing a monstrous character, absolutely. But we wanted to get under the skin a little bit more. We had only just finished filming a couple of days when we got the news. And it was horrible, and we were absolutely devastated, and at the same time feeling madly lucky to have come into contact with this incredible presence. God, she knew how to deliver a line. You and Rob met on Twitter, and then mined your real-life experiences for the show \u2014 agreeing not to make anything up. Is that still true? It\u2019s really not, if I\u2019m honest. It was a good rule to have because if we know that what we\u2019re talking about is at least the truth in our world, then no one can call us out on it, you know? Yes, there\u2019s definitely still bits and bobs in there that we\u2019ve taken from our own lives. But you can\u2019t stop those characters from becoming their own people. Now you\u2019ve got Sarah Jessica Parker delivering your lines in HBO\u2019s \u201cDivorce,\u201d which you created. It\u2019s a pretty joyous thing watching someone like her saying your words. That\u2019s a good buzz, sitting by the monitors watching Thomas Haden Church and Sarah Jessica Parker sparring. So that never stops being strange and wonderful. Couples watch that sparring in squirmy silence. I\u2019ve had that comment a lot, and I love the idea of couples watching my shows together. But I always felt that would be uncomfortable because things are said \u2014 and if people haven\u2019t said them, they\u2019ve thought them. Does it take different chops to write about the beginning of a relationship versus the end of one?  Oh gosh, you have to use your imagination more about the beginning of one. It\u2019s a very fun, sweet thing to write about two people falling in love, but I would say it comes more naturally to me to write about the dark side of it. Amy Gravitt, the head of comedy at HBO, said anyone who\u2019s been long-term married could write about how it feels to want a divorce. And it\u2019s a nice, vent-y thing. You can get things down on paper that you then don\u2019t have to say out loud to the person you love. Rob says \u201cCatastrophe\u201d was written against the idea that long-term relationships are boring.  I do agree with him. Whether you\u2019re at a really high point or a sort of desperate low point, they\u2019re always going to be interesting. And really, if they\u2019re boring then shame on you. The things that roll off your characters\u2019 tongues are deliriously smutty. Which one of you is innately filthier?  Well, there\u2019s definitely a lot of filth in there from me. But there\u2019s something about the fully formed filth that comes straight out of Rob that I need most. I\u2019ve never seen the like of it. I have to work really hard to make sentences funny or find the \u201cthing\u201d in them. But he has this ability to open his mouth and just perfect dialogue comes out of it and 80 percent of it is vile [laughs] \u2014 and it goes straight in there.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/television/sharon-horgan-and-the-fun-filth-of-catastrophe.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T10:00:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T10:00:03-04:00", "abstract": "The third season of the show begins Friday on Amazon, and finds the couple where they left off.", "title": "Sharon Horgan and the Fun Filth of \u2018Catastrophe\u2019"}
