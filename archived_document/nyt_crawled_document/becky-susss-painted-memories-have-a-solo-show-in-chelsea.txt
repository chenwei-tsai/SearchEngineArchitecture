{"text": "When her grandparents\u2019 Long Island home was sold and demolished, the artist Becky Suss ended up with much of its contents in her Philadelphia studio: sculptures, paintings, pillows, vases. So she started painting rooms filled with them. The resulting body of work \u2014 large-scale flattened images of domestic interiors \u2014 was exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia in 2015 and featured at the Independent Art Fair in New York last year. The Manhattan dealer Jack Shainman is now giving Ms. Suss her own show at his West 20th Street gallery. \u201cThey\u2019re just exquisite works \u2014 the compositions, the colors, the light,\u201d he said. Though the paintings\u2019 lack of perspective create a childlike charm, Mr. Shainman described them as \u201cvery sophisticated.\u201d \u201cThe grid within the grid within the grid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole painting is a play on formalism.\u201d The show, \u201cHomemaker,\u201d features new paintings that grew more out of the artist\u2019s imagination than her personal experience. \u201cI had been thinking about bringing the home into the gallery and having the art in the home and the home in the art,\u201d Ms. Suss, 36, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a step away from the autobiography of the previous work,\u201d Ms. Suss said. \u201cThinking about how paintings can become this place where distortions that happen in remembering things become legitimized, flattened into a new object.\u201d Having grown up just outside Philadelphia, Ms. Suss returned after graduating from Williams College, joining an artist collective. She worked in her studio by day and as a bartender at night before earning her M.F.A. from the University of California, Berkeley. She doesn\u2019t have to tend bar anymore. \u201cI get to just be an artist,\u201d Ms. Suss said, \u201cand that just feels totally unreal.\u201d The Shainman show is a major step forward; it features several large paintings as well as about a dozen smaller works. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a whole other level of exposure,\u201d Ms. Suss said. Although the body of work is new, Ms. Suss said it still feels connected to her original series, which captured pieces of her past. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a place that I remember or a place that I\u2019ve imagined,\u201d she said, \u201cthe physical act of having gone through making it releases it from being precious \u2014 something I have to hold on to.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/design/becky-susss-painted-memories-have-a-solo-show-in-chelsea.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:52:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:52:37-04:00", "abstract": "The artist\u2019s large-scale portrayals of domestic interiors are at the Jack Shainman Gallery at West 20th Street.", "title": "Becky Suss\u2019s Painted Memories Have a Solo Show in Chelsea"}
