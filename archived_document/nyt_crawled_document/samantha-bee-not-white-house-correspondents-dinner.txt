{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Forget alternative facts \u2014 Samantha Bee is pioneering the alternative dinner. And even though luminaries from the media and Hollywood were on hand to schmooze and talk politics, it was \u201cNot The White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner.\u201d The event was billed as a tribute to journalism, but it was also an opportunity for Ms. Bee and her guests to mock President Trump at every turn. \u201cYou continue to fact-check the president as if he might someday get embarrassed,\u201d Ms. Bee, who hosts the weekly talk show \u201cFull Frontal With Samantha Bee\u201d on TBS, told the crowd of 2,600 at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington on Saturday afternoon. \u201cTonight is for you.\u201d Hundreds of journalists, including CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, attended the event billed as an alternative to the official White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, which was set to take place later on Saturday. Proceeds from Ms. Bee\u2019s event were to benefit the Committee to Protect Journalists. Unlike journalism, which is supposed to be objective, Ms. Bee\u2019s dinner was not a bipartisan affair. It began with a taped sketch of Allison Janney playing a press secretary, a reprise of sorts for the actress who played C. J. Cregg, a White House press secretary, on \u201cThe West Wing.\u201d After taking questions from a number of fake outlets, including the Catholic news organization Opus Dei, Ms. Janney went on a rant, not unlike those written by Aaron Sorkin for \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d defending the legitimacy of legacy news organizations. In the sketches and monologues that followed, Hollywood made its disdain for Mr. Trump known. One taped piece with celebrities, including the actor Carl Reiner and comedian Kumail Nanjiani, made a mocking toast to Mr. Trump. Other bits included cameos by George Takei, Andy Richter and Steve Buscemi. Though this event, which was pretaped and will air on TBS on Saturday at 10 p.m. and again on Twitter at 11 p.m., was to be a tribute to journalists, Ms. Bee dedicated an entire segment to eviscerating Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN. Ms. Bee said he was responsible for pushing the network away from news coverage and toward shallow punditry. \u201cCable news has developed a critical pundit infestation,\u201d Ms. Bee said. \u201cAnd no one\u2019s house needs tenting worse than our friends at CNN.\u201d In another segment, she went after Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox News\u2019s parent company, alleging that he fostered a culture that allowed Roger E. Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly, the ousted former titans of the cable network, to thrive. She ran an \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d segment that included only Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Mr. Ailes, both of whom had been accused of sexual harassment before leaving the network. Ms. Bee said that they were \u201ctaken from us far too late.\u201d Ms. Bee also touted a special guest. The comedian Will Ferrell reprised his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d impression of former President George W. Bush, whose reputation some say has gotten a boost since Mr. Trump took office. \u201cHow do you like me now?\u201d Mr. Ferrell said, in character, while smoking a cigarette and speaking with an exaggerated twang. Just weeks after Ms. Bee\u2019s event was announced in January, Mr. Trump said he would be skipping the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner. Instead, he is hosting a rally for his supporters in Pennsylvania on Saturday night. This didn\u2019t change preparations for her show, Ms. Bee said. \u201cWe knew that we needed to do this independently of whatever he was going to decide to do,\u201d said Ms. Bee, who has emerged as one of the most aggressive voices taking on the president, in an interview before the event. Her strong stances have at times opened her up to criticism. Her show issued an apology in March for broadcasting a segment that showed short haircuts of attendees of the Conservative Political Action Conference, which a narrator repeatedly referred to as \u201cNazi hair.\u201d One of the subjects of the piece, it turned out, had cancer. However, she pushed back on the notion that the rush to take on Mr. Trump was causing comedians to make unforced errors that could potentially help the president. \u201cI can\u2019t really drop into that too much,\u201d Ms. Bee said. \u201cI do what I do in the most authentic voice possible. We try to be careful. Nobody\u2019s perfect. We do our best and then I just ignore what everybody says about me and that seems to work just fine.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/arts/television/samantha-bee-not-white-house-correspondents-dinner.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T20:40:38-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T20:37:49-04:00", "abstract": "The comedian\u2019s \u201cNot The White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\u201d was both an alternative to the dinner itself, and to a rally in Pennsylvania that Trump held instead of attending the dinner.", "title": "At Samantha Bee\u2019s \u2018White House\u2019 Dinner, Journalism Is Toasted as Trump Is Mocked"}
