{"text": "The gulf in the once-prominent rivalry between Connecticut and Tennessee, the most storied programs in Division I women\u2019s college basketball, has never been wider. But right in the heart of Lady Vols country, at least one player of state renown is all in on the Huskies\u2019 bid for an unprecedented fourth consecutive Division I national title. That player\u2019s wonderful basketball name is Crystal Dangerfield, who happens to be the first Connecticut recruit from the state where Coach Geno Auriemma\u2019s teams have, for two decades, been largely reviled, if grudgingly respected. \u201cI\u2019m hearing everybody say they can get it done,\u201d said Dangerfield, a 5-foot-6 point guard who recently completed her career at Blackman High School in Murfreesboro, Tenn., after committing to UConn as a junior. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll slip up, but I\u2019m psyched, can\u2019t wait to see them make history.\u201d It is difficult to gauge whether Dangerfield\u2019s position is less a home-state sacrilege now than it would have been a decade ago, when Tennessee and Connecticut were the annual main event of the women\u2019s college game. It nonetheless is a statement. \u201cI think now what this shows is where Connecticut has gone in the sport, which is where Tennessee used to be,\u201d said Monte Hale Jr., the sports editor of The Murfreesboro Post, who has covered what he calls the best girls\u2019 basketball district in Tennessee for 20 years. \u201cCrystal is an unbelievable point guard. It used to be if there was an elite player in Tennessee, it was a given that she\u2019d play for Pat Summitt.\u201d Tennessee has not played Connecticut since Summitt, the former coach, ended the regular-season series in 2007 after questioning Connecticut\u2019s tactics in recruiting Maya Moore. The chances are Tennessee will not survive long enough to confront UConn in the tournament, given its No. 7 seed in the Sioux City region, while the undefeated Huskies are the top seed in the Bridgeport region. Illustrative of Tennessee\u2019s recession since Summitt retired in 2012 after she was found to have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the Lady Vols fell out of the Top 25 in February for the first time in 31 years and, with a 19-13 record, wound up with their lowest seeding ever. Auriemma\u2019s team, conversely, is the favorite to claim its 11th national title, adding to his record. The recruitment of Dangerfield, a McDonald\u2019s all-American who was recently named Miss Basketball for the second consecutive season in Tennessee\u2019s Class AAA division, is probably no more than a locational coincidence, given Auriemma\u2019s need to replace his electric senior point guard, Moriah Jefferson. It still was a blow, at least symbolically, to the rabid Tennessee fan base that has begun to wonder about the team\u2019s direction under Coach Holly Warlick, the longtime Summitt assistant who replaced her. In a telephone interview, Dangerfield\u2019s mother, Davonna, said she did not want to say anything \u201cthat would be inflammatory in any way\u201d to the Tennessee fan base. There had been a fair amount of chatter on social media when Crystal announced her decision after visiting Connecticut early in her junior season. In fact, Davonna Dangerfield said, the family has lived in Tennessee (Murfreesboro is about two and a half hours from the Tennessee campus in Knoxville) \u201cfor all of Crystal\u2019s life.\u201d \u201cSo, of course, we would have loved for her to play here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t steer her, we followed her. And her desire to fulfill her dream was strong.\u201d With that, she called her daughter to the telephone to explain why, after playing basketball from age 5 and becoming a serious Lady Vols fan during the Candace Parker championship years of 2007 and 2008, she became enamored of Connecticut enough to announce her accelerated decision upon visiting Storrs, Conn., for the team\u2019s annual First Night ceremony in October 2014. Obviously, she said, the Huskies\u2019 runaway success of the past few years builds on itself, making a scholarship offer difficult to turn down. In addition, for both of her visits to Connecticut, Jefferson was her host, and she related to the standard Auriemma recruiting missive. \u201cMoriah said, \u2018They\u2019re going to strip you down and mold you into the player they want you to be,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dangerfield said. \u201cI loved hearing that. I watched them run a practice, and everything was at high speed, really precise. That\u2019s how I am, how I want to be.\u201d She added: \u201cI knew there were going to be some things said back home when I committed, but from when I was a young age, I never paid much attention to other people\u2019s ideas if I believed in mine. I am my own person.\u201d Davonna Dangerfield said there was a prideful component for her and her husband, Christopher, when \u201cwe saw that Crystal had the courage to not allow outside influences to push her in a certain way.\u201d Interested in music and in a possible career in medicine, Dangerfield, her mother said, \u201cdid her academic research because she knows basketball isn\u2019t going to be forever.\u201d It will, no doubt, be her indoctrination into the UConn culture \u2014 and at the mercy of Auriemma, who is notoriously tough on point guards. \u201cThat will be interesting to see, something to watch, how Crystal can deal with Geno,\u201d said Tom Insell, who coached Dangerfield with the Tennessee Flight, a premier club program. \u201cCrystal is the best recruit he\u2019s got coming in, but she\u2019s not a Maya Moore, a Breanna Stewart. \u201cShe\u2019s small but can really jump, is lightning quick and can shoot the 3. But she likes to handle the ball, and, you know, Geno expects his point guards to distribute, play a certain way.\u201d Insell knows Auriemma, as two of Insell\u2019s former players, Stefanie Dolson and Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis \u2014 neither from Tennessee \u2014 played for his club before starring at UConn. He does not believe Dangerfield will set a precedent of Tennessee\u2019s best fleeing northeast. And while he thought Warlick \u201cwould have taken\u201d Dangerfield, her most recent backcourt recruits might have created a logjam, understating Tennessee\u2019s push. \u201cTennessee has talent,\u201d Insell said. \u201cThey\u2019ll continue to draw talent. And next year, with Stewart and Jefferson gone, things will get interesting.\u201d Auriemma and Warlick have reportedly had informal chats about renewing the Connecticut-Tennessee series, with nothing promised. One of Dangerfield\u2019s high school teammates, Meme Jackson, is a Tennessee freshman. A city rival, Anastasia Hayes, outscored Dangerfield, 28-19, as Riverdale High recently upset Blackman, the defending champion, in the state tournament. Hayes, a junior, will probably be high on Tennessee\u2019s want list for 2017. If anything is crystal clear, it is that if the rivalry \u2014 once viewed as the women\u2019s game\u2019s best marketing tool \u2014 ever gets renewed, it will need fresh story lines. Without suiting up for UConn, Dangerfield has fired an enticing first shot.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/sports/ncaabasketball/a-bitter-pill-for-tennessee-in-its-rivalry-with-uconn.html", "published_date": "2016-03-18T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T02:00:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T02:00:10-04:00", "abstract": "One of the state of Tennessee&#8217;s top players, the electric point guard Crystal Dangerfield, is committed to the Huskies, as the teams&#8217; fortunes head in opposite directions.", "title": "A Bitter Pill for Tennessee in Its Rivalry With UConn"}
