{"abstract": "Only a tax break spared the Wall Street firm a dreary first quarter. Its young online banking unit, Marcus, is growing fast, however.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "Goldman Sachs\u2019s internal technology revolution cannot come soon enough. The Wall Street firm\u2019s young online retail-banking unit is growing and could, once big enough, crank out far higher returns than the investment bank. Goldman could do with some of that extra juice. At 11.4 percent, Goldman\u2019s annualized return on equity for the quarter places it in the upper echelons of the industry, along with the likes of JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. The trouble is, the return depended upon a low tax rate, which followed from a new accounting rule relating to the settlement of share awards. Without that benefit, Goldman\u2019s return for the quarter would have been just 8.9 percent \u2013 below the rule-of-thumb 10 percent needed to cover the cost of capital. Disappointing fixed-income, currency and commodities trading was a big part of the problem. The division\u2019s revenue was effectively flat relative to a poor first quarter for the industry last year. Rival traders at Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan bolstered their top lines by almost a fifth year-on-year. They also managed a slight boost in equities trading revenue while Goldman\u2019s fell 6 percent. That raises further questions about the contention by Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive, that the firm can win market share as others cut back. Goldman\u2019s fledgling Main Street operation is a bright spot. With more than $115 billion in deposits, it\u2019s already one of the top 25 banks in the United States by that measure. Marcus, as the online consumer-lending unit is called, is experiencing \u201cdemand more robust than we thought,\u201d the unit\u2019s boss, Harit Talwar, said recently. Marcus, like fintech rivals, offers a simpler, quicker, more flexible service than many traditional banks. But it also benefits from Goldman\u2019s deep pockets and cheap funding. That ought to give it an edge. Consumer lending can earn at least a 3 percent return on assets \u2014 triple what Goldman has been managing as a whole of late. And Mr. Blankfein\u2019s firm doesn\u2019t have branches and legacy technology costs to worry about. For now, lending through new web platforms remains a small industry, with just $40 billion of credit extended over a decade, according to Deloitte. Goldman needs the returns Marcus can eventually provide, but it will be a while before it is big enough to cover the shortcomings of other businesses.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/business/dealbook/for-goldman-the-fintech-revolution-cant-come-soon-enough.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T15:39:16-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "For Goldman, the Fintech Revolution Can\u2019t Come Soon Enough", "created_date": "2017-04-18T15:39:16-04:00", "section": "Business Day"}
