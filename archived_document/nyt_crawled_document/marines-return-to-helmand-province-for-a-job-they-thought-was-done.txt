{"text": "CAMP SHORABAK, Afghanistan \u2014 Before the American flag was lowered, folded and retired and the last of the Marines left the Afghan province of Helmand in 2014, their commander offered some optimistic parting words. The commander, Brig. Gen. Daniel D. Yoo, said the Marines had done their job, one of the largest undertakings in the force\u2019s history. At the peak of the war in southern Afghanistan, more than 20,000 Marines flooded the Taliban stronghold, pushing the insurgents out of several districts in Helmand. In their place, the Marines helped Afghan forces establish the combination of security and essential services that became known as a \u201cgovernment in a box.\u201d Afghan forces would now be responsible for security in Helmand, General Yoo said, \u201cand I am confident in their abilities to continue to succeed.\u201d It did not quite turn out that way. Since 2014, resurgent Taliban militants have gained territory, and the Afghan security forces have lost men at such high rates that entire units have needed to be replenished. The local \u201cgovernment in a box\u201d arrangements have mostly crumbled. So on Saturday, the Marines returned to Helmand with a force of 300; roughly half of them had previously served in the province. The same flag that was lowered in 2014 and then stored at the Pentagon office of the commandant of the Marine Corps was raised again at the 6,500-acre Camp Shorabak, which the Marines will be sharing with the Afghan Army\u2019s struggling 215th Maiwand Corps. The Marines\u2019 new mission is a difficult one: to assist and train Afghan soldiers and police to defend the provincial capital. The Taliban control seven of the province\u2019s 14 districts and are encroaching on five others. The government fully controls just two, local officials say. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of disheartening \u2014 the sacrifices you and your Marines made, and to see it go back to where it was,\u201d said Gunnery Sgt. Ronnie C. Mills, of Kentucky, who is on his second tour of Helmand after serving three tours in Iraq. During his previous stint in Helmand, Sergeant Mills served in Marja, which was the scene of one of the biggest battles in 2010 after President Barack Obama ordered a troop surge to break the Taliban\u2019s momentum. By the end of his tour in July 2011, Sergeant Mills said, the Marja district was \u201csafe enough to walk down the road, to go to the bazaars.\u201d Now, the Afghan troops who remain in Marja can be supplied only by air, because the government is struggling to clear and secure the roads leading to the district. Nevertheless, Sergeant Mills said he was hopeful that his team, drawing on their experiences in Helmand, could help the Afghan forces. The Afghans have the \u201cheart and ability,\u201d he said, but need to learn how to fight as cohesive units. \u201cIt will make a huge impact,\u201d he said of the arrival of the 300 Marines. \u201cEverybody here has sacrificed and been here before, and it means a lot to them to see this succeed.\u201d Helmand played a major role in the recent history of the Marine Corps, and it was once so saturated with Marines that some called it \u201cMarinistan.\u201d The Marine Corps\u2019 involvement in the province began in 2001, when Jim Mattis, who was then a brigadier general and is now secretary of defense, led about 1,000 Marines into the desert to establish one of the first American bases in the country after the invasion ordered by President George W. Bush. But only after Mr. Obama ordered the troop surge in 2009 did Marines pour into the province. In the absence of an Afghan security force, the Marines pushed out the Taliban and created opportunities for Afghans to govern their districts. In the process, about 350 Marines were killed in Helmand and thousands were wounded. \u201cPretty much my generation, when I came into the Marine Corps, all of the people above me had been here, and those were the people I looked up to,\u201d said Cpl. Allan Oshea, of Alabama, who is on his first tour of the province. \u201cWhen certain places fell again, it brought tears to people that had been here.\u201d The challenge facing the 300 Marines as they try to prepare the Afghan forces for the fight ahead was clear during the transfer of authority ceremony. Brig. Gen. Douglas A. Sims, the commander of the departing Army unit that the Marines are replacing, described the difficulties his soldiers had encountered since last fall. \u201cWe spent the first few months in a knife fight with the Taliban, as the enemy pressed hard for Lashkar Gah,\u201d General Sims said, referring to the provincial capital. \u201cThe governor and I spoke late into the evening, and early in the morning, with the sound of small arms and RPGs\u201d \u2014 rocket-propelled grenades \u2014 \u201cclearly audible across the river from his residence.\u201d He said he had seen more progress since the Afghan Army replaced a corps commander who is in jail now for corruption. But the biggest challenge for the Marines will be to help Afghan forces regain territory and hold it. Abdul Jabar Qahraman, President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s former envoy in charge of operations in Helmand, said that for a long time the people of Helmand had sided with the Afghan forces, but that the government had repeatedly failed the civilian population and \u201cleft them handcuffed for the brutal enemy.\u201d He said he expected that the Afghan forces would struggle to regain the population\u2019s trust. \u201cThere is no contact between the security forces and the local people,\u201d Mr. Qahraman said. \u201cPeople do not believe the promises of security forces, and the security forces always remain inside their bases, they don\u2019t get out.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/world/asia/marines-return-to-helmand-province-for-a-job-they-thought-was-done.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T15:43:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T15:43:37-04:00", "abstract": "Thousands of Marines once flooded the Afghan province to push out the Taliban.
