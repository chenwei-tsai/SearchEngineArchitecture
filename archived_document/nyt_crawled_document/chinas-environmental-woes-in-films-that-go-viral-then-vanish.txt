{"text": "BEIJING \u2014 Achieving fame was not hard for Wang Jiuliang, but staying in the spotlight has proved more difficult. His career as a documentary filmmaker has followed a distressing pattern: spectacular internet reactions to his movies and videos on environmental topics, followed by their rapid disappearance from the web in China. The latest, in January, was a video showing him standing before a large screen displaying appalling photos of indiscriminate quarrying and other environmental woes and delivering a talk about them. In one, mountaintops have been obliterated. In another, an aerial shot, a rocky landscape has been pockmarked with gaping holes where the stone was extracted. The video became an instant internet sensation, but four days after it was posted it disappeared. Another documentary of Mr. Wang\u2019s, \u201cPlastic China,\u201d about the plastic waste industry, which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival this year, also went viral in January before quickly disappearing from the internet in China. The wiry, 40-year-old Mr. Wang said he had no idea who had deleted the items or why. \u201cSome invisible power,\u201d he joked in a recent interview over coffee in Beijing\u2019s central business district. Before the talk on the environmental destruction from quarrying, Mr. Wang had spent the last decade filming China\u2019s mostly unregulated garbage dumps and their environmental impact. He produced two critically acclaimed documentaries that made him an authority on the subject. His first, \u201cBeijing Besieged by Waste,\u201d released in 2010, explored the garbage dumps encircling China\u2019s capital. Before then, few Chinese thought about where the waste went. The scenes of people and sheep grazing through the piles of garbage, and of trucks apparently dumping whatever they like with no authorities in sight, were a shock to most. \u201cIt is very important work, a milestone,\u201d Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, said in a telephone interview. Born a peasant\u2019s son in a village in China\u2019s eastern Shandong Province. Mr. Wang sold cellphones and vegetables to save for college, finally making it to the Communication University of China in Beijing, at 26, to study photography. In 2008, a year after graduating, Mr. Wang went back to his village to shoot a photo project and was horrified by the devastated landscape he found. \u201cI spent my childhood summers catching locusts and fish. Now where are they? Are there still tadpoles and frogs in the creek? No,\u201d he said. That prompted him to question what had happened and who was responsible. That quest drew him into environmental issues and he became curious about garbage and where it went in Beijing. Following garbage trucks, he found hundreds of trash dumps outside Beijing\u2019s fifth-ring road. The dumps, he found, were unregulated; trucks brought in whatever they liked without supervision. After three years of filming \u2014 and 9,300 miles on his motorbike \u2014 he marked on Google maps all the dumps he found. At the end, he produced \u201cBeijing Besieged by Waste.\u201d The Beijing government has since cleaned up more than 80 percent of the garbage dumps, Mr. Wang said. \u201cI found some answers. But I also started to have more questions,\u201d he said. In 2011, wanting to learn more about how garbage is recycled, Mr. Wang went to California. In one of the biggest waste recycling companies in Oakland, a manager pointed to a truck loaded with containers of plastic waste that was about to be shipped to China. \u201cI\u2019m not a nationalist at all, but somehow his words provoked me,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBecause I saw this junk \u2014 dirty and detrimental \u2014 going to China.\u201d Another six years\u2019 work went into finding and documenting what happens to imported plastic waste. The discovery shocked Mr. Wang. Thousands of family-run factories operate in the open air shredding the waste plastic into small particles to sell to factories in southern China, which then make them into new plastic goods. The air and nearby rivers are heavily polluted, he found. Workers sifting through the waste with their bare hands are often pricked by used needles. \u201cI\u2019m not against recycling plastic waste, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBut absolutely not this kind of raw method of recycling without protection and producing more pollution. The profit and cost is disproportionate.\u201d For one and a half years, Mr. Wang lived in a rented place near the two families he filmed, in a small town largely dependent on recycling imported plastic waste in Shandong, his home province. He hung out with the families every day, eating together and sometimes helping them with the work. The final product was \u201cPlastic China,\u201d an 81-minute film featuring the two families, and a 26-minute version that explains the industry itself and every character in its chain, like waste suppliers in the United States and Europe and Chinese workers who make their living from the trade. The longer version is nonjudgmental, showing the tough conditions faced by people scratching out an existence in a tough business with razor-thin margins. Its images are raw and bleak: dying fish in a nearby contaminated river are picked up for a family meal; a baby is born amid mountainous heaps of plastic; Yi Jie, 9, eldest daughter of one of the two families featured, cut pictures of ballet flats from an English magazine, just to have them to look at. Yi Jie was not going to school when Mr. Wang started to film, because her father said he did not want to pay the fees. When Yi Jie turned 11, Mr. Wang and the film\u2019s producing companies spent their own money to send Yi Jie back to her hometown in Sichuan to go to school. \u201cThey work for scanty wage and their health is impaired. This needs to be addressed from different sectors in a society,\u201d Mr. Ma said. Mr. Wang said there were handsome profits to be made from plastic waste, but mostly in the international trade. But \u201cPlastic China\u201d does not seek to criticize specific groups of people, said Ruby Chen, one of the film\u2019s producers. Rather, she said, everyone should reflect on their own roles in the trade after watching how the two families live. \u201cIf I\u2019m a policy maker, how to solve problems? If I run a small factory, is there a better way to do things? If I\u2019m a boss, is it really necessary to use all this plastic packaging?\u201d said Ms. Chen, joining the conversation with Mr. Wang over coffee. \u201cPeople who have watched it have told us: \u2018I will need to think carefully whether to use plastics.\u2019\u201d Mr. Ma compared Mr. Wang\u2019s films with Rachel Carson\u2019s book \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d a seminal work that helped start the environmental movement. \u201cRecycling plastics could have been a good thing, but if it isn\u2019t done well, it causes secondary pollution,\u201d he said. \u201cPlastics can\u2019t be degraded or buried. So it\u2019s very important to mobilize people to reduce using them.\u201d Mr. Wang said he was perplexed by the censorship of his work on the internet. \u201cOur goal is to let more people see it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope they would pay attention and changes could be made. But if the channel for communication is jammed, I have to reconsider what our efforts mean.\u201d Still, it is not stopping what the filmmaker is, in his own words, destined to do. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop caring. Otherwise he couldn\u2019t even sleep at night,\u201d Ms. Chen said with a laugh, \u201cHe is unrelenting. If he thinks this is important, he does it at all costs.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/world/asia/chinas-environmental-woes-in-films-that-go-viral-then-vanish.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T15:00:15-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Biography", "created_date": "2017-04-28T15:00:15-04:00", "abstract": "Wang Jiuliang\u2019s documentaries on topics like unregulated garbage dumps are internet sensations in China, but they are short-lived online.", "title": "China\u2019s Environmental Woes, in Films That Go Viral, Then Vanish"}
