{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 In France, blue-collar voters could determine if Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, upends expectations in the presidential runoff on Sunday. Ms. Le Pen has capitalized on their disenchantment with pledges to impose \u201cintelligent\u201d protectionism. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the candidate of the extreme left who won nearly 20 percent of the first-round vote, called on his supporters to not vote for Ms. Le Pen. But Ms. Le Pen would also benefit if disillusioned voters in the poorer, largely immigrant suburbs of Paris, many of whom supported Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, abstained. Ms. Le Pen said that she would name Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a Euroskeptic former rival, as her prime minister if she were elected. Emmanuel Macron, her centrist rival in the coming vote, visited two sites tied to France\u2019s wartime history. ____ \u2022 Young people across Eastern Europe are increasingly protesting the consolidation of power among corrupt politicians and untouchable oligarchs. In Slovakia, we met a pair of teenagers \u2014 Karolina Farska and David Straka \u2014 who have become unlikely media darlings with their anticorruption message. \u201cPeople say we are na\u00efve, and I guess we are na\u00efve,\u201d Ms. Farska said. \u201cBut we are learning, and we are not alone.\u201d ____ \u2022 Thousands of Russians gathered to present letters of protest at government offices, the second widespread show of public discontent in two months. Over a hundred people were arrested in St. Petersburg and in other cities. \u201cWe have Putin, we don\u2019t need food,\u201d read one sarcastic protest sign in the Siberian city of Tomsk. _____ \u2022 In Sweden, last month\u2019s terror attack by an Uzbek man whose asylum claim had been rejected has some calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration, which in turn raised fears among rejected asylum seekers. But the country is ill-equipped to deal with the challenge. The police estimate that 12,500 out of 18,000 rejected asylum seekers have gone underground. Sweden received 191,000 asylum applications in the last two years. _____ \u2022 President Trump celebrated his first 100 days in office over the weekend, bathing in the applause of a crowd of his bedrock supporters and reviving falsehoods about the economy and the news media. Mr. Trump became the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to address attendees of the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual convention. Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan agreement to fund the U.S. government through September, averting a shutdown next weekend. _____ \u2022 Chinese distant-water fishing vessels are heading to West Africa, where corruption and lax enforcement have opened the door to overfishing. \u2022 We spoke with five people who have been training artificial intelligence to replace them in doing their jobs. \u2022 \u201cFit and proper\u201d \u2014 Our media columnist looks into the regulatory standard that is haunting the Murdoch family\u2019s bid to gain complete control of the Sky satellite and cable network. \u2022 Ahead this week: Apple and Volkswagen earnings; the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on whether to raise interest rates on Wednesday. \u2022 Key markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 European Union leaders unanimously endorsed guidelines to negotiate the end of more than four decades of British membership in the bloc. [The New York Times] \u2022 The Turkish government expanded its crackdown on free expression, purging nearly 4,000 more public officials, blocking access to Wikipedia and even banning television matchmaking shows. [The New York Times] \u2022 An exiled Iranian television executive was assassinated by unknown assailants in Istanbul. [The New York Times] \u2022 Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, discussed women\u2019s rights and the war in Yemen with King Salman of Saudi Arabia in her first visit to the kingdom in seven years. [Associated Press] \u2022 Matteo Renzi, Italy\u2019s former prime minister, easily won a Democratic Party primary, a key step in his bid to return to power. [Politico] \u2022 Ueli Steck, a renowned mountain climber known as the \u201cSwiss Machine,\u201d was killed in a mountaineering accident near Mount Everest. [The New York Times] \u2022 Read a book you think you\u2019ll hate, and you\u2019ll become a better critic. \u2022 Be nice, and don\u2019t worry about the cool kids \u2014 research says you won\u2019t finish last. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Celebrate the season with pasta primavera. \u2022 Chelsea will almost surely be the Premier League champion, largely thanks to its ruthless and clinical tactics under Antonio Conte. \u2022 Maria Sharapova lost in the semifinals of the Porsche Grand Prix to Kristina Mladenovic, one of her biggest critics. \u2022 Ben Brantley, our chief theater critic, is reporting from London\u2019s West End this week. Here\u2019s his review of the musical \u201cDreamgirls.\u201d \u201cThe show comes roaring at you like a souped-up, chrome-plated luxury sedan,\u201d he writes. Today, the presidency of the U.N. Security Council changes hands. That\u2019s because the five permanent members and the 10 nonpermanent members each hold the role for one month, following English alphabetical order. Sweden was up when the year started. Ukraine took February and the United Kingdom got March. The United States held April and now hands off to Uruguay. Next month, the order starts back at the top: Bolivia, then China, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Italy and Japan. This is just the second time that Uruguay, a U.N. founding member, has held a Security Council seat. The first, in 1965-66, came after a reorganization to increase representation by those who are not permanent members of the council. Uruguay helped Singapore and a handful of other nations create the Forum of Small States, meant to allow small U.N. members to amplify their messages. For May, Uruguay\u2019s ambassador, Elbio Oscar Rosselli, above, organizes and speaks at meetings and sets schedules. You could say that he is well named for the role of international diplomacy. \u201cOscar\u201d spread across Europe and beyond thanks to the popularity of the epic works by the mid-18th century Scottish poet James Macpherson. The name has two possible roots: from Gaelic, meaning \u201cfriend of deer,\u201d or from Old English, meaning \u201csword of God.\u201d Lauren Hard contributed reporting. _____ This briefing was prepared for the European morning.
