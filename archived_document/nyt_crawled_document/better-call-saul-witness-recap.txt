One works perfectly, the other is a flop. Both promise to lift this show into a higher gear. Let\u2019s start with the flop, namely Mike\u2019s efforts to unmask whoever placed a tracking device on his car. The quest begins promisingly enough, with Mike\u2019s tailing a man who seems to have the job that, because of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d we know Mike will eventually inherit: errand man for the meth wholesaler and chicken retailer Gus Fring. Mike follows as this man makes his rounds, picking up something wrapped with aluminum foil in a hidey hole by a four-lane street. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a tuna fish sandwich. But project Track Down the Tracker begins to go awry when Mike enlists the help of Jimmy, whose job is to keep an eye on Mr. Errand when he makes his daily visit to Los Pollos Hermanos, the fast food restaurant chain owned by Gus. Jimmy, who rarely does subtle, ends up with his head in a garbage bin, rummaging for whatever Mr. Errand might have left behind as he exited the restaurant. After getting a full report about what little happened in Los Pollos, Mike sends Jimmy away. Then we get the episode\u2019s most memorable shot: Gus, staring balefully into the middle distance, evincing all the murderous intent behind his hospitality smile. The looks says that Gus knows something is amiss, that the guy he\u2019s had followed has followed him. This sets in motion a counter-counter-operation plan, with Gus\u2019s dead-eyed henchman, Victor (welcome back, Jeremiah Bitsui), driving a black SUV that carries the tracking device that Mike is tracking. The plan is to demonstrate to Mike that he is actually the fish, not the fisherman. We don\u2019t hear what is said when he answers the ringing cellphone that sits atop the gas-cap-tracking device combo that Victor has left in the middle of the highway. But I hope it\u2019s Gus, both warning Mike and telling him something like, \u201cI could use a guy like you.\u201d The other scheme is a sting perpetrated by Chuck, who has found a way to turn Jimmy\u2019s secretly taped confession into the sort of incriminating evidence that can be used in court. It isn\u2019t clear what that way is until Chuck explains to his law partner \u2014 not for the first time, it seems \u2014 that he\u2019s sure Jimmy will break and enter Chuck\u2019s home to retrieve that tape. He gets everything about the plan right, except his premonition that Jimmy will strike under cover of darkness. He comes during the day, and not stealthily. He kicks down Chuck\u2019s door, spewing outrage as he searches for and then destroys what appears to be the tape in question. There have been a lot of hard-to-watch moments in \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d But few are as crushing as the one, at the end of this episode, when two eyewitnesses emerge from another room and Jimmy realizes that his older brother, whom he loves, has added a new layer of merciless conniving to the treachery that provoked the break-in. What makes Chuck\u2019s long con so appalling is that it relies on the humanity of the people it cons. He knew that Jimmy would be moved to confess his own act of skulduggery at the end of Season 2, only because he correctly predicted that Jimmy would care enough to reassure Chuck about his mental faculties. And Chuck seemed to know that Ernesto (Brandon K. Hampton) would have enough compassion to alert Jimmy once he heard a snippet of Jimmy\u2019s taped confession. Chuck seems brilliant at exploiting all of the deeply human feelings that he doesn\u2019t seem to have. This makes him both hateable and \u2014 let\u2019s hand it to the man \u2014 very effective. A highlight of this episode was the arrival of Francesca (Tina Parker), whom \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d viewers will remember as the jaded, sexually harassed secretary in the offices of Saul Goodman. She perpetually wore an expression of resigned exasperation in that role. We see her here interviewing for the receptionist job at Jimmy and Kim\u2019s law firm, looking cheerful and uncrushed by all the misdeeds she has yet to witness and the miscreants she has yet to meet. She gets one of the episode\u2019s best lines. \u201cYou\u2019re a little crooked,\u201d she tells Jimmy, referring to the paint job he\u2019s done in the office lobby. She doesn\u2019t know how right she is. I also enjoyed the \u201cDead End\u201d and \u201cSpeed Hump Ahead\u201d signs along the road where Mike has staked out Los Pollos Hermanos. Foreshadowing doesn\u2019t get more succinct. Even better was the reveal of Los Pollos, through an ominous slow pan that would not have been out of place in a Godzilla flick, when the full scale of the beast is first revealed on screen. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been as pleased to see a fast-food restaurant, ever. If you\u2019d never watched \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d you would have found that shot a mystery. It is a reminder that \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d is a hybrid \u2014 a show with its own cast and plots, and prequel that will tell another story involving many of the same people. Part of the fun here is watching these two tales merge. O.K., to the Because We Never Learn segment of the recap, let\u2019s get some predictions: Is Jimmy about to get handcuffed and sent to jail? It sure seems like it. How quickly will Mike go from Gus\u2019s quarry to Gus\u2019s employee? When will Howard Hamlin give up those \u201cRoom With a View\u201d shirt collars? You know, I would never have thought to collect bottle caps.", "abstract": "A familiar face returns, and he\u2019s on a collision course with Mike.
