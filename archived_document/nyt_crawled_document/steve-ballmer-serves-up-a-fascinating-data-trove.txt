(No, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers.) It\u2019s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it Tuesday. But first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself. When Mr. Ballmer retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized \u201cI don\u2019t, quote, \u2018have anything to do.\u2019\u201d As he looked for a new endeavor \u2014 before he decided to buy the Clippers \u2014 his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected. \u201cBut come on, doesn\u2019t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?\u201d Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net. Her answer: \u201cA, it won\u2019t, because there are things government doesn\u2019t get to, and B, you\u2019re missing it.\u201d Mr. Ballmer replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d That conversation led Mr. Ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. He sought to \u201cfigure out what the government really does with the money,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cWhat really happens?\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Ballmer plans to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economists, professors and other professionals have been assembling as part of a stealth start-up over the last three years called USAFacts. The database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal, state and local governments. Want to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That\u2019s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways. Mr. Ballmer calls it \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make. \u201cYou know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I\u2019d get their 10-K and read it,\u201d he told me in a recent interview in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s wonky, it\u2019s this, it\u2019s that, but it\u2019s the greatest depth you\u2019re going to get, and it\u2019s accurate.\u201d In an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer\u2019s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table. \u201cI would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cPeople can disagree about what to do \u2014 I\u2019m not going to tell people what to do.\u201d But, he said, people ought to base their opinions \u201con common data sets that are believable.\u201d So how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation\u2019s data? Before he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this. His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. \u201cMy favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m missing.\u201d But neither option led him to what he was looking for. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at federal, state and local together,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a citizen, I don\u2019t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what\u2019s going on.\u201d With an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants. \u201cLet\u2019s say it costs three, four, five million a year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to fund the damn thing.\u201d For Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data. \u201cI love this one!\u201d he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. \u201cDon\u2019t look, don\u2019t look!\u201d He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page. \u201cHow many people work for government in the United States?\u201d he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. \u201cAlmost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?\u201d \u201cThen people say, \u2018Those damn bureaucrats!\u2019\u201d Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. \u201cWell, let\u2019s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education \u2014 they are government employees.\u201d And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows. \u201cAnd you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?\u201d Mr. Ballmer continued. \u201cWell, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste suddenly start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we\u2019re very glad to have. \u201cNow people might not think they\u2019re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people \u2014 and most of these people you like,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. His other big surprises? \u201cMost of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. \u201cI mean it\u2019s funny, but I didn\u2019t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.\u201d Mr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his preconceived notions could change his own politics. At one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, \u201cIf you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they\u2019re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn\u2019t thought about them.\u201d \u201cTake the mortgage deduction,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.\u201d One rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data \u2014 no outside providers \u2014 to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges. For example, Mr. Ballmer, said: \u201cYou know it\u2019s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.\u201d There is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, \u201calong with other data, but not a total,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t show it! I\u2019m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can\u2019t report the data.\u201d Mr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports. \u201cWe\u2019re making philanthropic donations elsewhere \u2014 I think of this as another,\u201d he said, referring to himself and his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t even deduct this for my taxes. I pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because I don\u2019t want anybody being able to think that factors in. But I feel like it\u2019s a civic contribution more than anything else.\u201d", "abstract": "A stealthy pet project by the former Microsoft chief lets you search and learn about how the government spends tax dollars.", "section": "Business Day", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/business/dealbook/steve-ballmer-serves-up-a-fascinating-data-trove.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Steve Ballmer Serves Up a Fascinating Data Trove", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T21:03:42-04:00"}
