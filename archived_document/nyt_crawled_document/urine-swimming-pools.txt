{"text": "As summer approaches, many of us are looking ahead to languid days by the pool. New research, alas, suggests many of them are laced with something other than water. Though we all suspect it\u2019s there, it\u2019s not easy to assess how much urine there is in a particular swimming pool (the existence of a chemical that changes color when you pee is an urban legend). But it is not an insignificant public health question. So a team of chemists at the University of Alberta in Canada has devised a new way to estimate the amount by measuring levels of an artificial sweetener commonly present in people\u2019s urine. The scientists sampled 29 pools and hot tubs in British Columbia and Alberta, and found the artificial sweetener, called acesulfame potassium, in every one. In one residential, 110,000-gallon pool, they estimated the amount of urine to be nearly eight gallons, enough to fill the trash can you keep under the kitchen counter. In a 220,000-gallon pool (one-third the size of an Olympic pool), the researchers estimated there were nearly 20 gallons of urine \u2014 roughly equivalent to the amount of water a standard washing machine uses per load. Acesulfame potassium is often found in condiments, beverages, desserts, toothpaste and chewing gum. It\u2019s an ideal proxy for urine, said Lindsay Blackstock, a graduate student who helped lead the study, because it passes through the body without being metabolized. It is excreted exclusively in urine \u2014 unlike sucralose, shed mostly in feces. Other markers of urine, such as urea and potassium, are found in sweat as well as urine. The components of urine and sweat \u2014 not to mention personal care products \u2014 react with chlorine to form compounds called disinfection byproducts that can irritate the eyes, lungs and skin. Pools owe their characteristic smell not to chlorine but to such a compound, trichloramine, which has been linked with asthma in professional swimmers and pool workers. \u201cI view these disinfection byproducts as roughly the equivalent of secondhand smoke \u2014 they\u2019re things that just don\u2019t have to be there,\u201d said Ernest Blatchley, a professor of environmental engineering at Purdue University who was not involved in the new study. Still, Ms. Blackstone stresses that overall the benefits of maintaining a healthy lifestyle through swimming far outweigh any potential risks from exposure to disinfection byproducts. \u201cThe solution is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cJust be kind to your fellow swimmers.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/science/urine-swimming-pools.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Science", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T11:28:44-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T11:28:44-04:00", "abstract": "Chemists calculated how much urine is in swimming pools by measuring the presence of a proxy: an artificial sweetener that passes straight through the body.", "title": "Come On In.
