Bush was right to challenge President Trump\u2019s proposed budget, given the life-or-death consequences of the foreign aid cuts he seeks. In response to a global outcry, Mr. Bush established the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, in 2003, garnering bipartisan support and unmitigated success, demonstrated by a plethora of data. Despite that evidence, Mr. Trump has proposed current year cuts to Pepfar. Maintaining funding should be the floor for congressional support for Pepfar. Experts estimate that a $700 million increase is needed to continue the progress that has saved nearly 12 million lives and is going a long way to ending H.I.V. as an epidemic. At this critical moment in the global H.I.V. response, Congress is best advised to ignore President Trump\u2019s cruel, fact-free prescription and instead fully fund Pepfar and build on the progress made over the last 14 years. Failure to fully fund Pepfar will result in increasing rates of H.I.V., more unnecessary and avoidable deaths and a more expensive global H.I.V. response in the future.
