{"text": "If you have to be dragged back into familial distress, why not let a mythical plesiosaur do the tugging. In \u201cFossils,\u201d an inventive entry in the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, a sighting of the Loch Ness monster forces a young scientist to confront her unhappy past. Narratively slight and at least a little nutty, this piece, created by the company Bucket Club, is deft in form and nifty in presentation. Vanessa (Helen Vinten) is a hard-working, hard-thinking evolutionary biologist who probably sleeps under her desk. Her idea of a hot and heavy Saturday night? Arguing with creationists in chat rooms. Most of her research is deeply unsexy and involves experiments with the skin cells of a coelacanth, \u201ca living fossil\u201d of a fish, once thought to have gone extinct 65 million years ago. But an unusually clear image of Nessie upends her studious life. Journalists invade Vanessa\u2019s lab with questions about the work of her father, a researcher obsessed with the monster, who went missing years ago. Eventually, she and her cheery Ph.D. student Dominic (Adam Farrell) light out for that lake of legend, where Vanessa will try out some advanced imaging technology and maybe come to grips with Dad\u2019s disappearance. To hold a fossil is to clutch a fragment of prehistory, and \u201cFossils\u201d explores what remains \u2014 personally, zoologically \u2014 of times and creatures gone by. But the production tantalizes with, rather than delivers on, this theme. Running just over an hour and relying on only three performers (Luke Murphy, playing another doctoral student, is the third), it ends at least a scene too soon, before we get any sense of how Vanessa\u2019s adventures will affect her life. But let\u2019s talk about how the ingenuity of \u201cFossils\u201d might affect yours. (And Nessie\u2019s. More than eight months have passed since anyone has reported a sighting, so she could use the publicity.) Bucket Club\u2019s style mixes story theater and toy theater with both whimsy and rigor. The set consists of a couple of water tanks up front, along with a lot of plastic dinosaurs. At a mixing board in the back, the actors loop music and their own voices to make a wonderfully weirdo score, composed by the sound designer David Ridley. One of the instruments they use is a repurposed video game console that should have L\u00e9on Theremin giggling in his grave. Under Nel Crouch\u2019s direction, these three performers manipulate stegosaurus figurines and act, score and narrate with scientific precision and obvious warmth. It\u2019s very likely that you don\u2019t believe in the Loch Ness monster and you may not believe in \u201cFossils.\u201d But you should have faith in these actors.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/theater/review-a-search-for-dad-and-the-loch-ness-monster-in-fossils.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T16:00:00-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-05-02T16:00:00-04:00", "abstract": "In this collaborative work by the company Bucket Club, a sighting of the mythical monster forces an evolutionary biologist to confront her unhappy past.", "title": "Review: A Search for Dad, and the Loch Ness Monster, in \u2018Fossils\u2019"}
