{"text": "FRANKLIN, Tenn. \u2014 At a Chris Stapleton concert, there is incendiary singing, rich celebrations of country music tradition and, most important, the eye thing. It happens frequently onstage when that country singer and his wife, Morgane, face each other, not the crowd, and hold each other\u2019s gaze for seconds, sometimes minutes. It is a shocking reframing of live performance. Even though the show is technically Mr. Stapleton\u2019s, with Ms. Stapleton singing backup, and even though there is an audience rapturously watching, often it feels as if the whole room is reduced to wordless, loving conversation between two people. \u201cWe\u2019re married so we hold each other accountable,\u201d Mr. Stapleton said last month on the family ranch in this unassuming town 30 minutes and several light-years south of Music Row in Nashville. \u201cWe can lift each other up on bad nights, kind of give each other a wink when we screw up or do something funny.\u201d The dynamic between the two is one of country\u2019s great treats, a vivid display of affection that elevates their music. It also creates a showcase for Ms. Stapleton, who, over a decade ago, was an aspiring country star with a record deal of her own. Her harmonies are some of the most affecting parts of \u201cFrom a Room: Volume 1,\u201d Mr. Stapleton\u2019s second solo album, which will be released on Friday, two years after \u201cTraveller,\u201d his debut, which went platinum and earned him two Grammys, five Country Music Association awards and the somewhat unexpected role of high-profile vintage country preservationist. Like \u201cTraveller,\u201d \u201cFrom a Room\u201d is earthen, rich with tradition, has a tactile intensity and is carefully measured. It\u2019s full of songs about romantic disappointment and people letting each other down, often with the Stapletons singing in devastating harmony, like on \u201cLast Thing I Needed, First Thing This Morning\u201d and \u201cUp to No Good Livin\u2019.\u201d \u201cTraveller\u201d kickstarted Mr. Stapleton\u2019s solo career (after years in bands, and one false solo start) and, as a bonus, revived his wife\u2019s as well. The two met in 2003. Both were songwriters who plied their trade in adjacent buildings, and Ms. Stapleton was close friends with the woman responsible for pushing Mr. Stapleton\u2019s songs to singers who might record them. After a few months, he asked if she\u2019d like to write a song together. She proposed Friday at 6 p.m., a time when not much songwriting gets done. Four years later they were married. They have two children, now 6 and 8. When they met, Ms. Stapleton was signed to the label Arista Nashville under her maiden name, Morgane Hayes. \u201cI think the label was looking for Gretchen Wilson, the total package \u2014 a crazy talented woman, who could write great songs and sing the hell out of them,\u201d Ms. Stapleton said. \u201cI was still trying to find my voice.\u201d Though she recorded about three albums\u2019 worth of songs, she never formally released any music. Her Myspace page survives, revealing a tender-voiced singer with sass and a dark streak. (Check out the wry \u201cWe Just Talk About It\u201d and the bitter \u201cWe Tried.\u201d She sang demos for $60 a pop (until someone told her she could charge $125), and backed up Lee Ann Womack on tour. She had some success as a songwriter, including on Carrie Underwood\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Forget to Remember Me,\u201d which went to No .2 on the Billboard country songs chart. Though Ms. Stapleton played her own shows occasionally, she hated the spotlight. As a young singer, she performed with her sister, but standing out in front, alone, unnerved her: \u201cI broke out in hives one time \u2014 I don\u2019t remember why. I have an aversion to the spotlight. It\u2019s not for everybody.\u201d Then, as now, Mr. and Ms. Stapleton shared the stage, though then it was Mr. Stapleton backing her on guitar. \u201cHe definitely gave me a boost of \u2018you can do this\u2019 \u2014 not because he said it, but just because he was standing with me,\u201d she said. But Mr. Stapleton wasn\u2019t seeking the limelight, either. \u201cI think it\u2019s why he\u2019s always got a beard, he\u2019s always got long hair.\u201d She asked to be released from her record contract, and for years largely avoided the stage. Before \u201cTraveller,\u201d Ms. Stapleton occasionally joined Mr. Stapleton\u2019s set, but during the tour for that album, her presence became more frequent, and more integral. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the moment, but I remember feeling like I can\u2019t miss this anymore,\u201d she said. Now when the Stapletons tour, it is as a family, with Ms. Stapleton\u2019s mother home schooling the children. \u201cWhen we weren\u2019t taking the kids, I always felt like I couldn\u2019t win,\u201d Ms. Stapleton said. \u201cI was always in the wrong place.\u201d Now, the show is incomplete without their interplay, Mr. Stapleton\u2019s lionesque roar against Ms. Stapleton\u2019s rustic balm. \u201cI was singing with Chris long before he knew I was singing with him,\u201d she said, remembering how she would ask his publishing representative for \u201cvolumes of his songs, CDs of everything he\u2019d ever written up until that point, and I would take them home and study and sing along.\u201d And she is a major driving force in Mr. Stapleton\u2019s song selection. \u201cFrom a Room\u201d is made up of songs written many years ago, drawn from a 1,000-deep catalog. (Part 2 of the album is due this year.) \u201cShe is such a great litmus,\u201d said Dave Cobb, Mr. Stapleton\u2019s producer. \u201cShe has a huge input on what becomes the sound of the record.\u201d Ms. Stapleton has recently released one song where she is credited first (alongside her husband): a scintillating, bluesy cover of \u201cYou Are My Sunshine,\u201d on a compilation by Mr. Cobb. \u201cThey light each other up,\u201d Mr. Cobb said. \u201cHe knows that when she walks in the room, he\u2019s got to make it better.\u201d The trust runs both ways. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be medicated anymore to get onstage,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to be so afraid that I would have to take beta blockers so I wouldn\u2019t shake.\u201d Though Ms. Stapleton has no specific plans to release more music under her name, \u201crecently we\u2019ve had a few conversations of, \u2018Hey, what would that be?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cJust casual conversation, really.\u201d If it happens, it will certainly be with Mr. Stapleton at her side, probably with eyes fixed on each other. \u201cAs much as I can talk about him being a comfort to me, I think in that way I also am a comfort to him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can look at each other and know, \u2018O.K., I got you.\u2019\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/arts/music/chris-stapleton-morgane-find-a-room-interview.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T16:47:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T16:47:54-04:00", "abstract": "The visual and musical dynamic between the Stapletons is one of country music\u2019s great treats, a vivid display of affection that elevates their songs.", "title": "For Chris Stapleton, a Fellow Traveller: His Wife, Morgane"}
