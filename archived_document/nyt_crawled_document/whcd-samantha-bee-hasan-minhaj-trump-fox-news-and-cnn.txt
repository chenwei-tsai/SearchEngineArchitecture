{"text": "When the comedian Hasan Minhaj stepped up to deliver his remarks at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner on Saturday night, he had known for more than two months that President Trump would skip  the gala. Samantha Bee, who broadcast her own competing event, called the \u201cNot The White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner,\u201d on the same night, probably never wanted Mr. Trump there in the first place. But in the absence of Mr. Trump, who instead gave a rally in Harrisburg, Pa., Mr. Minhaj, a correspondent on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cDaily Show\u201d, and Ms. Bee, the host of TBS\u2019s \u201cFull Frontal,\u201d took a page from the playbook of this president, whose relationship with the news media has been singularly contentious, and vented their spleens at the press. Though the comedians\u2019 programs were shown in opposition to each other, they arrived at similar places. Both celebrated the First Amendment and the freedoms it grants, but they also took sharp aim at the news media, urging reporters to show more integrity and to win back the respect of the American public. \u201cWe\u2019re living in this strange time where trust is more important than truth,\u201d Mr. Minhaj said in his performance at the Washington Hilton Hotel. \u201cAnd supporters of President Trump trust him. And I know journalists, you guys are definitely trying to do good work. I just think that a lot of people don\u2019t trust you right now. And can you blame them? I mean, unlike Anderson Cooper\u2019s bone structure, you guys have been far from perfect.\u2019\u2019 Ms. Bee, whose show was recorded on Saturday afternoon at DAR Constitution Hall, made similar observations. \u201cWith so much excellent reporting out there, why do 96 percent of Americans believe the media should be strung up by its own bowels?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe because when they turn on the TV looking for news, all they can find are journalists trying to referee a pack of well-coiffed message robots shouting at each other all day from increasingly tiny boxes.\u201d Mr. Minhaj, 31, who described himself as \u201ca first-generation Indian-American Muslim kid,\u201d arguably had the tougher task of the night. He agreed to appear at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner at a time when it has come under renewed criticism for enabling the cozy mingling of reporters and the government officials they cover. And Mr. Minhaj lacked the star power of past entertainers like Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel. As Mr. Minhaj said at the start of his routine, \u201cNo one wanted to do this. So of course, it lands in the hands of an immigrant.\u201d He added, \u201cDon Rickles died just so you wouldn\u2019t ask him to do this gig.\u201d On \u201cFull Frontal,\u201d Ms. Bee, 47, a \u201cDaily Show\u201d alumna, has made an asset of her status as an outsider unwelcome in the boys\u2019 club of late-night television. Her counterdinner, which raised funds for the Committee to Protect Journalists, did not lack for celebrity support: it included appearances from Allison Janney, Steve Buscemi, Patton Oswalt and Will Ferrell, who dusted off the impersonation of President George W. Bush he perfected on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d for the occasion. As Mr. Bush, Mr. Ferrell also took the press to task: \u201cYou guys would always sneak up on me with gotcha questions like, \u2018Why are we going to war?\u2019 Gotcha. \u2018Why did you not respond to Hurricane Katrina?\u2019 Gotcha. \u2018What is your middle name?\u2019 Gotcha.\u201d He added, \u201cI just wish someone had told me that all you have to say is \u2018fake news,\u2019 over and over again.\u201d The White House Correspondents\u2019 event had sincere speeches from journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, and the briefest of taped messages from Alec Baldwin, who regularly impersonates Mr. Trump on \u201cS.N.L.\u201d \u201cKeep up the good work,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said in his message. Mr. Minhaj got off to a bit of a shaky start, joking that \u201cUSA Today is what happens when the coupon section takes over the newspaper\u201d and wondering why the news media is so focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s weekend golf trips. But when his one-liners fell flat, Mr. Minhaj was prepared. \u201cEven if you guys groan,\u201d he told the room, \u201cI\u2019ve already hired Kellyanne Conway. She\u2019s going to go on TV on Monday and tell everyone I killed.\u201d Ms. Bee came out swinging, particularly at CNN and Jeff Zucker, who is president of CNN Worldwide, and who she said is \u201cfilling the air time between car crashes with a reality show loosely based on the news.\u201d Arguing that Mr. Zucker had reduced CNN\u2019s news operation to a kind of sports coverage, Ms. Bee said, \u201cThere\u2019s no truth or falsehood in sports. There\u2019s just winners and losers, and people giving 110 percent because sports thinks that\u2019s a number. The difference is, on CNN, the cheerleaders get paid.\u201d Ms. Bee and Mr. Minhaj both had plenty of barbs about Fox News, which has been roiled by the exits of Roger E. Ailes, its chairman, and Bill O\u2019Reilly, its top-rated host, amid allegations of sexual harassment. Mr. Minhaj described Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s reported $25 million severance package as \u201cthe only package he won\u2019t force a woman to touch.\u201d Ms. Bee said, \u201cTurns out it\u2019s bad business to have your flagship show hosted by 400 pounds of sexual harassment allegations in a 200-pound bag.\u201d But Mr. Minhaj delivered perhaps the stronger and more poignant closing summation. Even though Mr. Minhaj said he had been told not to mock Mr. Trump or his administration in absentia, he felt he had a duty to \u201cget on this stage and make fun of the president.\u201d \u201cBut the president didn\u2019t show up,\u201d Mr. Minhaj said. \u201cBecause Donald Trump doesn\u2019t care about free speech. The man who tweets everything that enters his head refuses to acknowledge the amendment that allows him to do it.\u201d A few hours from now, Mr. Minhaj said, \u201cDonald Trump will be tweeting about how bad Nicki Minaj bombed at this dinner. And he\u2019ll be doing it completely sober. And that\u2019s his right. And I\u2019m proud that all of us are here tonight to defend that right, even if the man in the White House never would.\u201d After thanking the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, and thanking Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein \u201cfor inspiring a generation of journalists,\u201d Mr. Minhaj concluded by saying, \u201cI would like to thank Donald Trump for inspiring the next.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/television/whcd-samantha-bee-hasan-minhaj-trump-fox-news-and-cnn.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T03:23:22-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T03:23:22-04:00", "abstract": "Programmed against one another, the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner and Ms. Bee\u2019s alternative end up in the same place \u2014 criticizing the president and the press.", "title": "In Dueling Events, Samantha Bee and Hasan Minhaj Target Trump, Fox News and CNN"}
