{"text": "\u201cAmerican Gods\u201d brings Neil Gaiman\u2019s acclaimed novel to television and finds unexpected relevancy. And the songwriter known as Poo Bear cracks a window onto his life. AMERICAN GODS 9 p.m. on Starz. Neil Gaiman\u2019s beloved 2001 novel comes to the screen, bringing with it a melting pot of themes and music, deities old and new, and the humans \u2014 like Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle), an ex-con who hits the road with the enigmatic Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane) \u2014 who stand in for them. It\u2019s bloody, hazy and somewhat bewildering, particularly for those who haven\u2019t read Mr. Gaiman\u2019s book. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to wait for the story to take shape, there are compensations,\u201d Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. \u201cThe action hums along, even if you can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s going, and there\u2019s a welcome edge of humor (not abundant in this genre), especially in the performances of Mr. McShane and Pablo Schreiber as a tall Irishman who calls himself a leprechaun.\u201d Not to be missed: \u201cGillian Anderson shows up, delightfully, as one of the new gods, who takes the form of Lucy Ricardo in \u2018I Love Lucy\u2019 and speaks to Shadow from a display of flat-screen TVs.\u201d THE LEFTOVERS 9 p.m. on HBO. As the anniversary of the Departure approaches, Kevin Garvey Sr. (Scott Glenn) \u2014 filled with a vision that is either a divine prophecy or outright insanity \u2014 wanders through the Australian Outback as he tries to save the world from apocalypse. CAROL (2015) 10 p.m. on TMC. Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett), a glamorous New Jersey suburbanite whose sexual desires are destroying her marriage and jeopardizing her future with her daughter, enters into a scandalous love affair with Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a lonely department store clerk who\u2019s quietly rebelling against expectations. Todd Haynes\u2019s sumptuous romance, spun from the Patricia Highsmith novel \u201cThe Price of Salt,\u201d is set in 1952, the year the American Psychiatric Association proclaimed homosexuality a \u201csociopathic personality disturbance.\u201d \u201cAt once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, \u2018Carol\u2019 is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros,\u201d A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. POO BEAR: AFRAID OF FOREVER on Red Bull TV. Jason Boyd, a.k.a. Poo Bear \u2014 songwriter for Justin Bieber, Usher, Jill Scott and Chris Brown \u2014 opens the door to his recording studio, where he schedules four or five daily sessions on a quest to create his next big hit. That\u2019s just half of the fear factor. The other: his pending marriage. THE FALL on Netflix. Catch all three installments of this British serial-killer thriller, which ended its second season with the resident psychopath, Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan), bleeding out in the arms of Stella Gibson, Gillian Anderson\u2019s chilly, enigmatic police investigator, brought in to ignite a stalled murder case in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Was he truly dead? Of course not \u2014 but his life was in grave danger, as a severely wounded Spector is seen being prepped for surgery.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday-american-gods-and-poo-bear-afraid-of-forever.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T01:00:36-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Schedule", "created_date": "2017-04-30T01:00:36-04:00", "abstract": "\u201cAmerican Gods\u201d brings Neil Gaiman\u2019s acclaimed novel to television, with surprising relevancy.
