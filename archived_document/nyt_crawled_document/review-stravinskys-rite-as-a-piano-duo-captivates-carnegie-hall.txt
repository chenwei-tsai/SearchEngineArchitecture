{"text": "Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cRite of Spring\u201d retains the power to shock in part through its raw, blazingly colorful orchestration. But the piece actually first came into being as a piano duo. Throughout his life, Stravinsky liked to sketch his pieces at the piano. So the piano version of the \u201cRite\u201d is, in a way, the original. In 1912, a year before the riot-inducing premiere of the \u201cRite\u201d by the Ballets Russes in Paris, Stravinsky played the first part of the score for a small group at the home of the French critic Louis Laloy. His partner was Debussy. (Imagine being in attendance.) When they finished, Laloy recalled in his memoirs, everyone was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d and \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by this \u201churricane which had come from the depths.\u201d On Friday at Carnegie Hall, two formidable pianists, Leif Ove Andsnes and Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin, ended their concert with a fearless, incisive and surprisingly alluring account of this \u201coriginal\u201d version of the \u201cRite.\u201d The audience may have been as overwhelmed \u2014 in the best way \u2014 as that group in 1912. Familiar episodes of this score \u2014 the pummeling \u201cDances of the Young Girls,\u201d the ritualistic \u201cSpring Rounds,\u201d the mysterious introduction to the second part \u2014 came through with stunning freshness and clarity. There was a long standing ovation. They opened with an elegant, crisply articulate performance of Mozart\u2019s Larghetto and Allegro for Two Pianos, a work left in sketchy form by the composer and played here in a completion by the pianist Paul Badura-Skoda. And given the association of Debussy and Stravinsky, it was fascinating to hear Debussy\u2019s \u201cEn blanc et noir\u201d for piano duo, played splendidly. This suite is a late Debussy work, composed in 1915 in the aftermath of the \u201cRite,\u201d and for all its surface beauties, this music is comparably subversive. The first movement courses by in a wash of splashing runs and whirling figurations. The slower middle movement has a defiantly disjointed structure that shifts from funereal dirges to eerie quotations of the chorale \u201cEin feste Burg.\u201d The final scherzo keeps you guessing: One moment bursts into riotous wildness, the next detours into untethered ruminations. Though I was eager to hear the \u201cRite,\u201d I was even more excited to hear Stravinsky\u2019s inexplicably neglected Concerto for Two Pianos (a rare example of a concerto without orchestra). Stravinsky completed it in 1935 to perform with his son Soulima. Though the piece falls into the Neo-Classical phase of the composer\u2019s career, the music resists categorization. The spiky first movement opens with tart scales and low-register rumblings, through which an insistent theme breaks through. Stravinsky\u2019s audacious inventiveness continues through a deceptively calm Notturno movement, a bracing set of mini-variations, and, to end, an elaborate prelude and fugue laced with biting humor. Mr. Andsnes and Mr. Hamelin gave a commanding performance. After the \u201cRite,\u201d they played three Stravinsky encores, including \u201cMadrid\u201d (imagine a Cubist-like musical evocation of Spanish dance) and the wily \u201cCircus Polka.\u201d When they performed \u201cCircus Polka\u201d at the 2012 Ojai Festival in California, Mr. Andsnes and Mr. Hamelin donned clown noses. Without resorting to facial props on Friday, they had Stravinsky\u2019s polka sounding plenty amusing on a great night at Carnegie.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/music/review-stravinskys-rite-as-a-piano-duo-captivates-carnegie-hall.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T17:19:43-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-30T17:19:43-04:00", "abstract": "Leif Ove Andsnes and Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin gave a commanding performance and received a long standing ovation.", "title": "Review: Stravinsky\u2019s \u2018Rite\u2019 as a Piano Duo Captivates Carnegie Hall"}
