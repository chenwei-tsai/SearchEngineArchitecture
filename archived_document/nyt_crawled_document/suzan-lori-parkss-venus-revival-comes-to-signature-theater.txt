She wrote Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cGirl 6,\u201d his first film that he didn\u2019t write the screenplay for, and \u201cVenus,\u201d a play directed by the downtown avant-garde auteur Richard Foreman about Sarah Baartman, the 19th-century star of English freak shows billed as Hottentot Venus. In both cases, critics described the marriage of these considerable talents as strained (although \u201cVenus\u201d did win two Obie Awards, including one for writing). Two decades later, Ms. Parks, a Pulitzer Prize winner and one of the most acclaimed playwrights in America, is bringing \u201cVenus\u201d back, in a Signature Theater revival that will follow the performer from her home in South Africa to fame in Europe that ends in tragedy. The Obie winner Lear deBessonet directs. The play begins previews on Tuesday, April 25, and stars Zainab Jah from \u201cEclipsed.\u201d (212-244-7529; signaturetheatre.org.)", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/theater/suzan-lori-parkss-venus-revival-comes-to-signature-theater.html", "section": "Theater", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "This Pulitzer-winning playwright\u2019s 1996 work, about a 19th-century star of English freak shows, will be directed by Lear deBessonet, an Obie winner.", "title": "Suzan-Lori Parks\u2019s \u2018Venus\u2019 Revival Comes to Signature Theater", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T11:09:16-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
