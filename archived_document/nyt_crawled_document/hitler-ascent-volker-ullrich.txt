{"updated_date": "2017-04-19T12:00:07-04:00", "text": "How did Adolf Hitler \u2014 described by one eminent magazine editor in 1930 as a \u201chalf-insane rascal,\u201d a \u201cpathetic dunderhead,\u201d a \u201cnowhere fool,\u201d a \u201cbig mouth\u201d \u2014 rise to power in the land of Goethe and Beethoven? What persuaded millions of ordinary Germans to embrace him and his doctrine of hatred? How did this \u201cmost unlikely pretender to high state office\u201d achieve absolute power in a once democratic country and set it on a course of monstrous horror? A host of earlier biographers (most notably Alan Bullock, Joachim Fest and Ian Kershaw) have advanced theories about Hitler\u2019s rise, and the dynamic between the man and his times. Some have focused on the social and political conditions in post-World War I Germany, which Hitler expertly exploited \u2014 bitterness over the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles and a yearning for a return to German greatness; unemployment and economic distress amid the worldwide Depression of the early 1930s; and longstanding ethnic prejudices and fears of \u201cforeignization.\u201d Other writers \u2014 including the dictator\u2019s latest biographer, the historian Volker Ullrich \u2014 have focused on Hitler as a politician who rose to power through demagoguery, showmanship and nativist appeals to the masses. In \u201cHitler: Ascent, 1889-1939,\u201d Mr. Ullrich sets out to strip away the mythology that Hitler created around himself in \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and he also tries to look at this \u201cmysterious, calamitous figure\u201d not as a monster or madman, but as a human being with \u201cundeniable talents and obviously deep-seated psychological complexes.\u201d \u201cIn a sense,\u201d he says in an introduction, \u201cHitler will be \u2018normalized\u2019 \u2014 although this will not make him seem more \u2018normal.\u2019 If anything, he will emerge as even more horrific.\u201d This is the first of two volumes (it ends in 1939 with the dictator\u2019s 50th birthday) and there is little here that is substantially new. However, Mr. Ullrich offers a fascinating Shakespearean parable about how the confluence of circumstance, chance, a ruthless individual and the willful blindness of others can transform a country \u2014 and, in Hitler\u2019s case, lead to an unimaginable nightmare for the world. Mr. Ullrich, like other biographers, provides vivid insight into some factors that helped turn a \u201cMunich rabble-rouser\u201d \u2014 regarded by many as a self-obsessed \u201cclown\u201d with a strangely \u201cscattershot, impulsive style\u201d \u2014 into \u201cthe lord and master of the German Reich.\u201d \u2022 Hitler was often described as an egomaniac who \u201conly loved himself\u201d \u2014 a narcissist with a taste for self-dramatization and what Mr. Ullrich calls a \u201ccharacteristic fondness for superlatives.\u201d His manic speeches and penchant for taking all-or-nothing risks raised questions about his capacity for self-control, even his sanity. But Mr. Ullrich underscores Hitler\u2019s shrewdness as a politician \u2014 with a \u201ckeen eye for the strengths and weaknesses of other people\u201d and an ability to \u201cinstantaneously analyze and exploit situations.\u201d \u2022 Hitler was known, among colleagues, for a \u201cbottomless mendacity\u201d that would later be magnified by a slick propaganda machine that used the latest technology (radio, gramophone records, film) to spread his message. A former finance minister wrote that Hitler \u201cwas so thoroughly untruthful that he could no longer recognize the difference between lies and truth\u201d and editors of one edition of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d described it as a \u201cswamp of lies, distortions, innuendoes, half-truths and real facts.\u201d \u2022 Hitler was an effective orator and actor, Mr. Ullrich reminds readers, adept at assuming various masks and feeding off the energy of his audiences. Although he concealed his anti-Semitism beneath a \u201cmask of moderation\u201d when trying to win the support of the socially liberal middle classes, he specialized in big, theatrical rallies staged with spectacular elements borrowed from the circus. Here, \u201cHitler adapted the content of his speeches to suit the tastes of his lower-middle-class, nationalist-conservative, ethnic-chauvinist and anti-Semitic listeners,\u201d Mr. Ullrich writes. He peppered his speeches with coarse phrases and put-downs of hecklers. Even as he fomented chaos by playing to crowds\u2019 fears and resentments, he offered himself as the visionary leader who could restore law and order. \u2022 Hitler increasingly presented himself in messianic terms, promising \u201cto lead Germany to a new era of national greatness,\u201d though he was typically vague about his actual plans. He often harked back to a golden age for the country, Mr. Ullrich says, the better \u201cto paint the present day in hues that were all the darker. Everywhere you looked now, there was only decline and decay.\u201d \u2022 Hitler\u2019s repertoire of topics, Mr. Ullrich notes, was limited, and reading his speeches in retrospect, \u201cit seems amazing that he attracted larger and larger audiences\u201d with \u201crepeated mantralike phrases\u201d consisting largely of \u201caccusations, vows of revenge and promises for the future.\u201d But Hitler virtually wrote the modern playbook on demagoguery, arguing in \u201cMein Kampf\u201d that propaganda must appeal to the emotions \u2014 not the reasoning powers \u2014 of the crowd. Its \u201cpurely intellectual level,\u201d Hitler said, \u201cwill have to be that of the lowest mental common denominator among the public it is desired to reach.\u201d Because the understanding of the masses \u201cis feeble,\u201d he went on, effective propaganda needed to be boiled down to a few slogans that should be \u201cpersistently repeated until the very last individual has come to grasp the idea that has been put forward.\u201d \u2022 Hitler\u2019s rise was not inevitable, in Mr. Ullrich\u2019s opinion. There were numerous points at which his ascent might have been derailed, he contends; even as late as January 1933, \u201cit would have been eminently possible to prevent his nomination as Reich chancellor.\u201d He benefited from a \u201cconstellation of crises that he was able to exploit cleverly and unscrupulously\u201d \u2014 in addition to economic woes and unemployment, there was an \u201cerosion of the political center\u201d and a growing resentment of the elites. The unwillingness of Germany\u2019s political parties to compromise had contributed to a perception of government dysfunction, Mr. Ullrich suggests, and the belief of Hitler supporters that the country needed \u201ca man of iron\u201d who could shake things up. \u201cWhy not give the National Socialists a chance?\u201d a prominent banker said of the Nazis. \u201cThey seem pretty gutsy to me.\u201d \u2022 Hitler\u2019s ascension was aided and abetted by the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of domestic adversaries who failed to appreciate his ruthlessness and tenacity, and by foreign statesmen who believed they could control his aggression. Early on, revulsion at Hitler\u2019s style and appearance, Mr. Ullrich writes, led some critics to underestimate the man and his popularity, while others dismissed him as a celebrity, a repellent but fascinating \u201cevening\u2019s entertainment.\u201d Politicians, for their part, suffered from the delusion that the dominance of traditional conservatives in the cabinet would neutralize the threat of Nazi abuse of power and \u201cfence Hitler in.\u201d \u201cAs far as Hitler\u2019s long-term wishes were concerned,\u201d Mr. Ullrich observes, \u201chis conservative coalition partners believed either that he was not serious or that they could exert a moderating influence on him. In any case, they were severely mistaken.\u201d \u2022 Hitler, it became obvious, could not be tamed \u2014 he needed only five months to consolidate absolute power after becoming chancellor. \u201cNon-National Socialist German states\u201d were brought into line, Mr. Ullrich writes, \u201cwith pressure from the party grass roots combining effectively with pseudo-legal measures ordered by the Reich government.\u201d Many Germans jumped on the Nazi bandwagon not out of political conviction but in hopes of improving their career opportunities, he argues, while fear kept others from speaking out against the persecution of the Jews. The independent press was banned or suppressed and books deemed \u201cun-German\u201d were burned. By March 1933, Hitler had made it clear, Mr. Ullrich says, \u201cthat his government was going to do away with all norms of separation of powers and the rule of law.\u201d \u2022 Hitler had a dark, Darwinian view of the world. And he would not only become, in Mr. Ullrich\u2019s words, \u201ca mouthpiece of the cultural pessimism\u201d growing in right-wing circles in the Weimar Republic, but also the avatar of what Thomas Mann identified as a turning away from reason and the fundamental principles of a civil society \u2014 namely, \u201cliberty, equality, education, optimism and belief in progress.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/books/hitler-ascent-volker-ullrich.html", "section": "Books", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "A new biography portrays Hitler as a clownish, deceitful narcissist who took control of a powerful nation thanks to slick propaganda and a dysfunctional elite that failed to block his rise.", "title": "In \u2018Hitler,\u2019 an Ascent From \u2018Dunderhead\u2019 to Demagogue", "published_date": "2016-09-26T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T12:00:07-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "item_type": "Article"}
