{"text": "LIVING IN THE WEATHER OF THE WORLD By Richard Bausch 242 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95. Richard Bausch\u2019s \u201cLetter to a Young Writer\u201d is a literary call to arms that\u2019s been passed around for years. Containing the Ten Commandments of the writing life, it offers advice on everything from how and what to read to acknowledging the importance of accepting failure along the way. Coming in at No. 3 on his list is a quote from Flaubert: \u201cBe regular and ordinary in your habits, like a petit bourgeois, so you may be violent and original in your work.\u201d Looking at Bausch\u2019s career as a whole \u2014 and his new story collection in particular \u2014 it\u2019s clear that he has followed his own advice. With 12 novels and eight story collections published since 1980, he\u2019s managed to send original fiction out into the world with stunning regularity. Violence doesn\u2019t always figure overtly in Bausch\u2019s fiction, but the atmosphere never precludes it. Sometimes the violence is deeply buried and psychological, an underground river of anguish that threatens to flood the surface narrative. Or it\u2019s the kind of violence that comes from above, like an act of God, a battering of one\u2019s chances against the cosmic wheel. Bausch\u2019s latest book is aptly titled. The 14 stories in \u201cLiving in the Weather of the World\u201d inhabit places where the outlook for their characters is uncertain at best and cataclysmic at worst. Here love and marriage are brittle, people are driven by lust and desire they barely comprehend, and a lack of self-knowledge can ruin a man\u2019s life just as surely as a loaded gun. Sometimes the action is galvanic, an explosive moment that puts the reader in mind of Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s ability to open out a story into dangerous, unknown territory. And, like O\u2019Connor, Bausch is able to pull a story back from melodrama, no matter how sudden or dramatic the turn of events. In \u201cWalking Distance,\u201d an off-duty Memphis cop named Joseph Koren can\u2019t believe his good fortune at having married, a little more than two years earlier, his lovely wife, Ella. He considers himself an aesthete, an admirer of beauty, whether in a woman or in the May colors of the street outside his picture window. The world is on display there, winking and shining back at him. Yet one morning, as he\u2019s about to set out for his usual four-mile walk, a trivial domestic spat mushrooms unexpectedly. Suddenly the couple find themselves in the midst of a potential breakup and Joseph\u2019s heading for the door. His service revolver, out of habit, is in his belt. \u201cHe strode away, like a kind of falling.\u201d A less accomplished writer might have lost us right here. The action could feel spring-loaded, preordained, but what follows is a stunning and strange encounter with a self-described \u201cbandit\u201d who attempts to mug Joseph during his loop through the tree-lined neighborhood. In the shift of power and violence that takes place between the two men, there\u2019s a kind of curbside confessional. \u201cMy wife told me this morning, man. She\u2019s leaving me,\u201d Joseph blurts out. \u201cI thought we were happy. I\u2019m falling over, you know? I\u2019m sailing down. Plummeting. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d The would-be mugger, who \u201cwore a baseball cap with the FedEx logo on it, only the word was FEDUP,\u201d says \u201cJesus.\u201d Then, a beat later, \u201cIf I\u2019d\u2019ve known. I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve bothered you, really.\u201d When a story can bring us convincingly to this kind of reversal, we know we\u2019re in the hands of a writer keenly attuned to the subtleties of human frailty and want. Bausch routinely takes us out to the end of the narrative pier and asks us to jump. Infidelity, as a literary theme, interests me less at face value than just about anything I can think of. But in three of these stories, Bausch uses it to excavate a surprising sense of drama and revelation. In \u201cSympathy,\u201d we find a middle-aged woman named Faith enjoying \u201cBringing Up Baby\u201d on her DVR one Saturday afternoon while her husband, Freddie, is out with his older brother at a horror movie matinee. The moment before the phone rings \u2014 changing her life and marriage irrevocably \u2014 there\u2019s a flash of foreshadowing as she watches \u201cCary Grant chase after the little spotted dog while being pursued by the leopard.\u201d Because we\u2019re in a Richard Bausch story, we know the mention of a large carnivore isn\u2019t accidental. Within a few pages, we\u2019re at the emergency room and Faith\u2019s teenage son has been picked up from his basketball game. Freddie has suffered a heart attack and Janice, a \u201cchain-smoking nurse friend\u201d who \u201cloved gossip,\u201d provides the details of his admittance. \u201cThey brought him in naked,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought he came from you.\u201d This complicates matters in all the right ways, but Bausch is seldom content with the small detonations of marital life. He wants the implosion that immobilizes everything around it. And so \u201cpresently the entrance doorway slid open again, and a woman entered, carrying a clear plastic bag with clothes in it \u2014 you could see the shadow-shape of a shoe and the sleeve of a jacket.\u201d \u201cFreddie Hayes,\u201d she says, arriving at the E.R. window. \u201cI have his things.\u201d As the two women encounter each other, we experience Faith\u2019s emotions as a rush of memory and re-examination. In the sifting of marital flotsam, her life disperses into a haze: \u201cThe room was too bright. \u2026 She felt the light as a form of burning, and closed her eyes, and then opened them again.\u201d This is a steppingstone to a moment of grace: \u201cShe turned to the girl, who really looked like nothing more than a girl, with her stringy hair and her thin white face and her fright, the brown eyes wide and quick, looking at Faith and then at the room. Faith touched the side of her face.\u201d That Bausch can deliver such convincing humanity, no matter the initial angle of ascent, is a testament to his powers of technique and observation. Not all the stories in this collection are as vertiginous as the two I\u2019ve mentioned here, but they\u2019re all well crafted and energized. Moving among them, we find two half siblings rediscovering each other after decades; a talented young artist becoming beguiled (and betrayed) by the woman whose nude portrait he\u2019s been commissioned to paint; an old couple grappling with choice amid a terminal illness; a drama-prone sister crashing her brother\u2019s honeymoon; two 90-something World War II veterans, one German, one American, reuniting in the media spotlight. The world and the range of its emotional weather are on full display. In Bausch\u2019s \u201cLetter to a Young Writer,\u201d Rule No. 6 simply reads: \u201cBe willing.\u201d \u201cBe open for business all the time,\u201d Bausch explains. \u201cYou must try to be that person on whom nothing is lost.\u201d After nearly 40 years of his distinctive, sometimes electrifying fiction, it\u2019s fair to say that Bausch has stayed open for business through all kinds of circumstances and conditions, that he\u2019s been able to keep the lights on and burning bright.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/books/review/living-in-the-weather-of-the-world-richard-bausch.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T07:00:28-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T07:00:28-04:00", "abstract": "In his new collection, \u201cLiving in the Weather of the World,\u201d Richard Bausch proves yet again that he\u2019s a master of the short story.", "title": "A Battering of Chances Against the Cosmic Wheel"}
