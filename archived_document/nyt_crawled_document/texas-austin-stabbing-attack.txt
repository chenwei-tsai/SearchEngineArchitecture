{"text": "AUSTIN \u2014 A man killed one student and wounded three others on Monday at the University of Texas, walking calmly from one to another and stabbing them with a bowie knife, setting off panic and rumors of a larger wave of violence. The university police identified the suspect as Kendrex J. White, a 21-year-old student who was quickly arrested. Witnesses described the suspect as eerily composed during the episode near Gregory Gymnasium, and said that when he was confronted by police officers, he did not speak or appear to hurry. Rachel Prichett, 19, a student from Austin, said she was standing at a food truck when she heard screaming, turned and saw a man holding what looked like \u201ca small machete\u201d approaching her, \u201cjust walking calmly with the knife to his side.\u201d The suspect walked behind a man a few feet away from her, then grasped the man\u2019s shoulder with one hand and with the other hand stabbed him in the back, thrusting the knife \u201call the way in.\u201d Ms. Prichett said she fled, running past another victim, his head bloody, who was slumped over a table. In recent weeks, fraternity houses at the university had been vandalized with messages accusing them of promoting racism and rape. Many people on campus speculated Monday that the knife attack was related. But Chief David Carter, of the University of Texas at Austin Police Department, said the authorities did not know of a motive for the stabbings. Speaking at a news conference, Chief Carter said that he was aware of the rumors but that he did not know if the victims, all men, were fraternity members. Mr. White is black. Chief Carter said the four who were stabbed, all age 20 or 21, included three white men and one Asian-American man. One died at the scene, and the others were taken to the university medical center. The authorities did not immediately release the victims\u2019 names. After the attack, unfounded rumors flew of more violence and more assailants on the loose, and there was a bomb threat against a nearby building. A student who said he knows Mr. White socially, William Verastegui, said the suspect had always seemed friendly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to be hotheaded; he didn\u2019t seem to be an angry person or anything like that,\u201d Mr. Verastegui said. The grassy open areas on campus were crowded with students on Monday. The police received the first report of the stabbing at 1:49 p.m. Officers arrived within two minutes and arrested Mr. White without incident. Ray Arredondo, 21, a student from San Antonio, said, \u201cI just saw swarms of people running away from Gregory Gym, and my first reaction was \u2018gun,\u2019 so I ran, too.\u201d \u201cThe cops were on scene, and they were doing CPR on one victim,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was another guy who had lacerations to his head or neck, and a police officer was holding his head.\u201d He used his phone to take a picture of officers taking Mr. White into custody and posted it to Twitter. \u201cHe was like emotionless, very nonchalant, from what I saw,\u201d Mr. Arredondo said. Another Twitter user posted a short video showing a man sitting on brick steps, with other people pressing on what appeared to be a bloody wound in his back. Local television news footage later showed what appeared to be that same man being loaded into an ambulance. Lindsey Clark, 20, a student from Richardson, Tex., heard screaming, then saw police officers force the suspect to the ground outside the Jester Center, across the street from the gymnasium. She said she heard an officer say, \u201cDon\u2019t move or you\u2019re going to get tased.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/texas-austin-stabbing-attack.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T19:41:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T19:41:06-04:00", "abstract": "A man who witnesses described as eerily composed as he stabbed students with a bowie knife was quickly apprehended by the police.", "title": "Man Wielding Knife Kills One and Injures Three at University of Texas"}
