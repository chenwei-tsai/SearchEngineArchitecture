Between 41st and 61st Streets is a glaring gap in the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway, as the path that surrounds the island is called, where along the East River only a highway runs by. But on Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would spend $100 million on narrowing the largest gap in the 32-mile loop with an esplanade over part of the gap. Another $5 million will be spent on accelerating efforts to fill in smaller gaps in East Harlem and Inwood. \u201cThe Hudson River Greenway has vastly improved quality of life on the West Side, and we want families in every corner in the borough to have that same access to bike, walk and play along the water,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. \u201cThis is the first of many big investments we\u2019ll make as we bring the full Greenway to reality.\u201d Construction to fill in part of the missing piece, from 53rd to 61st Street, will begin in 2019 and is expected to take three years. The path will be built over the water and rest atop pilings, similar to the paths on the Upper West Side. Those stand about 15 feet off the shoreline on a boardwalk over the water, parallel to the land. Plans for rest of the gap on the East Side are unclear, but it remains a priority of the de Blasio administration. The greenway began in 1993 under Mayor David N. Dinkins. Alicia Glen, the current deputy mayor for housing and economic development, who worked for Mr. Dinkins when he was the Manhattan borough president, recalled poring over maps of the city with him, working out how to create parkland from what was mostly overlooked industrial waterfront. \u201cThis is something that has been dreamed of and talked about for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cJust think how cool it\u2019s going to be when the single most important island, maybe on planet earth, when you can walk or bike all the way around it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is one for the ages. That\u2019s really exciting work.\u201d The expansion of the path circumnavigating Manhattan is welcome news for many, including those who use it for exercise. \u201cThe more places and spaces for New Yorkers to run, the better,\u201d said Chris Weiller, a spokesman for New York Road Runners. \u201cRunners are always looking for new routes to run, and now if there\u2019s a new loop around Manhattan, they can check one more thing off the bucket list.\u201d The esplanade will eventually connect bike paths that run around the city\u2019s perimeter. Biking has boomed in recent years, but cyclists who want to circumnavigate Manhattan are forced to detour onto streets along the East Side and areas of East Harlem, Harlem and Inwood. \u201cA longer greenway will also help us meet the surging demand in daily cycling,\u201d Polly Trottenberg, the city\u2019s transportation commissioner, said in a statement. The most recent significant expansion of esplanade occurred in 2010 when a pathway was opened between 91st and 81st Streets along the Hudson River. According to the Transportation Department, the 11-mile span it completed along the city\u2019s West Side is now used by more than 7,000 cyclists daily.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/nyregion/city-commits-100-million-to-narrowing-a-gap-in-manhattan-greenway.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:07:23-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "City Commits $100 Million to Narrowing a Gap in Manhattan Greenway", "item_type": "Article"}
