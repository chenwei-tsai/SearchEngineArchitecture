Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst at comScore, called the offerings \u201can uncommon blend of welcome diversity.\u201d \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d (Universal), directed by F. Gary Gray and starring the likes of Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne Johnson and Ludacris, was No. 1 for a third consecutive weekend, taking in an estimated $19.4 million, for a new domestic total of $192.7 million and a worldwide one of $1.06 billion. \u201cHow to Be a Latin Lover\u201d (Pantelion-Lionsgate), which cost about $10 million to make, was second. It sold about $12 million in tickets, or roughly 50 percent more than analysts had expected before its release.
