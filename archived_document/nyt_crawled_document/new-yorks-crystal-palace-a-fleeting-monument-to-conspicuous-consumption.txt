{"text": "\u201cIn studying the industry of all nations, then, and the results of all kinds of genius,\u201d the Rev. Dr. E. H. Chapin of New York proclaimed, \u201clet us recognize the beauty of use and the use of beauty.\u201d Dr. Chapin was exuberantly describing the 1853 Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations at New York\u2019s Crystal Palace. Those who missed the moral significance Dr. Chapin found in the beauty of the graphics, chandeliers, steam-driven pumps, silks, sculptures, guns, cameras, clocks, printing presses and even a device that measured a ticket-holder\u2019s lung capacity \u2014 and expected life span \u2014 can catch a fleeting glimpse of what was America\u2019s first World\u2019s Fair, now through July 30 at the Bard Graduate Center Gallery in Manhattan. The show, \u201cNew York Crystal Palace 1853,\u201d is accompanied by an online digital publication, which is based on Bard\u2019s 2015 Focus Project, conducted by faculty and students, \u201cVisualizing 19th-Century New York.\u201d Inspired by London\u2019s 1851 Great Exhibition, New York City\u2019s fathers leased Reservoir Square, now the site of Bryant Park, to build a glass and cast iron showcase that encompassed nearly 175,000 square feet of exhibition space and was crowned by a dome that was 100 feet in diameter and 148 feet high. Built on West 42nd Street, which was then the city\u2019s northern edge, the Crystal Palace was the largest building in the country. The adjoining Latting Observatory, a 315-foot-high wooden tower, was the tallest structure in New York. No coincidence that the building\u2019s facade was transparent. The idols of this temple were meant to be visualized. Modern lithographs, daguerreotypes, engravings, panoramas and bird\u2019s eye views (including some of the first depictions of uniformed police officers) vividly depict the vitality of mid-19th century New York jammed with carts and pedestrians and festooned with flags and banners. The World\u2019s Fair site was flanked on the east by the Egyptian-style Croton Distributing Reservoir, itself a modern engineering marvel, and farther on the west by Broadway, which Harper\u2019s New York Monthly Magazine wrote could \u201cpass for the three-miles-long nave of a Crystal Palace.\u201d \u201cIn words and especially in images,\u201d the curator, David Jaffee, a former City University of New York professor and head of new media research at Bard Graduate Center (who died in January), wrote, \u201cthese writers and graphic artists, publishers and printers, were convinced that the nineteenth-century city could only be captured and understood in visual terms.\u201d What was officially called the Temple of Industry and Art was dedicated in an opening ceremony by President Franklin Pierce and featured nearly 4,400 exhibitors. The exhibition was not a financial success (a season pass cost $10, more than $250 in today\u2019s dollars; the fair ended in November 1854 $300,000 in debt), but for its 15 months was mid-Manhattan\u2019s biggest tourist attraction. P. T. Barnum, the fair\u2019s second president, drummed up audiences by, among other stunts, demonstrating Elisha Otis\u2019s safety brake by raising an elevator cab to the dome and cutting the cable. Among the artifacts displayed at Bard are an early Singer sewing machine; a William Sidney Mount \u201cCradle of Harmony\u201d violin; salt prints by John Adams Whipple and Victor Prevost; a Colt percussion revolver; a parian marble reproduction of Hiram Powers\u2019s \u201cthe Greek Slave,\u201d; a grand rosewood parlor armchair; silver medals, decorative tableware; and a selection of World\u2019s Fair guidebooks and souvenirs. The collection of luxury goods was \u201ca monument to the developing commodity-driven culture of New York City,\u201d Clara Boesch wrote in the digital catalog. \u201cCast your eye around that glorious array, and if you look at it in its moral significance, it teaches us that there is a great end in life beyond merely toiling and achieving conquests over Matter,\u201d Dr. Chapin declared. \u201cIt illustrates great progress, peace and unity.\u201d \u201cThe world becomes more and more like a single organic body, with the steam engine for its beating heart, and its nerve of electric wire,\u201d he said in The New York Times. The progress proved to be fleeting. Despite all the publicity that the Crystal Palace was fireproof, it burned to the ground in 1858. The last object in the Bard exhibit embodies the fair\u2019s evanescence: a chunk of fused glass from the building\u2019s remains. \u201cAt a time when many New Yorkers are troubled by the security costs of a structure dedicated to the vanity of one man,\u201d Professor Ivan Gaskell, head of the Focus Gallery Project at Bard Graduate Center, said, \u201cIt seems worth recalling the 1853 Crystal Palace as a building devoted to conspicuous production rather than conspicuous consumption, though this didn\u2019t save it from eventually going up in flames.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/design/new-yorks-crystal-palace-a-fleeting-monument-to-conspicuous-consumption.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T13:02:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T13:02:03-04:00", "abstract": "\u201cNew York Crystal Palace 1853\u201d at the Bard Graduate Center Gallery offers a glimpse of America\u2019s first World\u2019s Fair.", "title": "New York\u2019s Crystal Palace: A Fleeting Monument to Conspicuous Consumption"}
