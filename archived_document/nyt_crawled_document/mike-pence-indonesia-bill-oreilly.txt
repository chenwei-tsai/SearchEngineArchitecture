The most famous photograph of a very camera-shy monster was published in The Daily Mail 83 years ago this week. The sinuous silhouette of the Loch Ness monster (affectionately known as Nessie) appeared in the British paper in April 1934. The picture, taken in the Scottish highlands by a respected London gynecologist, is known as \u201cthe surgeon\u2019s photograph\u201d and claimed to show the monster\u2019s long neck and head above the water. The picture ignited a media frenzy that year, with The Times itself mentioning the beast no fewer than 55 times. Though many pictures of \u201cNessie\u201d have been taken over the years (most disproved as being wakes from boats, optical illusions, birds or otters), the surgeon\u2019s photograph remains the clearest shot. But, alas, it was proved to be a hoax in 1994, nothing more than a small model on top of a toy submarine. Despite the hoax (and a number of others like it), many still believe that the monster exists, hidden in dark water that can reach depths of almost 750 feet. Last year, Nessie-hunters did find something at the bottom of the loch \u2014 a 30-foot movie prop of the monster. For now, it\u2019s the closest thing to finding Nessie itself.
