{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 An American missile-defense system whose deployment in South Korea angered China has gone into operation, officials said on Tuesday, even as turmoil over who would pay for the system continued to roil the South\u2019s presidential campaign. Last July, the United States and South Korea agreed to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, battery in South Korea to deal with North Korea\u2019s growing ballistic missile threats. Despite protests from China, which said the deployment undermined its own missile defense capabilities, the allies began installing the radar and other key components of Thaad at an abandoned golf course in Seongju, 135 miles southeast of Seoul, last week. \u201cU.S. Forces Korea confirms the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is operational and has the ability to intercept North Korean missiles and defend\u201d South Korea, Col. Robert Manning III, a spokesman for the United States military in Seoul, said in a statement on Tuesday. Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said that with the equipment already deployed, the Thaad battery \u201chas acquired an initial capability to deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threat.\u201d The announcement came as a controversy continued to rage over the cost of the Thaad system. President  Trump caused alarm in South Korea on Thursday when he told Reuters that he wanted Seoul to pay for the Thaad system, whose cost he estimated at $1 billion. South Korea has repeatedly told its people that the Americans had agreed to pay for the system and its operation and maintenance, with Seoul providing land and the support infrastructure. On Sunday, the White House national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, called his South Korean counterpart, Kim Kwan-jin. Mr. Kim\u2019s office later said that the two \u201creconfirmed what has already been agreed\u201d about the system\u2019s costs. But the confusion was far from over. General McMaster later told Fox News that the United States would stick to its word \u201cuntil any renegotiation.\u201d \u201cThe last thing I would ever do is contradict the president of the United States,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cWhat the president has asked us to do is to look across all of our alliances and to have appropriate burden-sharing, responsibility-sharing. We\u2019re looking at that with our great ally South Korea; we\u2019re looking at that with NATO.\u201d Such comments led many South Koreans to suspect that the Trump administration might attempt to renegotiate the Thaad deal or demand that South Korea increase its annual contribution, estimated at $820 million last year, to help pay for maintaining American troops in the country. On Tuesday, South Korea\u2019s main opposition party, the Democrats, called the government\u2019s decision to accept the Thaad deployment \u201ca total failure of diplomacy.\u201d The party\u2019s presidential candidate, Moon Jae-in, is leading polls by a large margin ahead of the May 9 presidential election to choose the successor of the recently ousted President Park Geun-hye. Ms. Park agreed to the Thaad deployment before she was impeached for corruption in December. She was formally removed from office in March. \u201cAt first, they said we needed to provide the land only. Now while our country was in the middle of an election campaign, they sneaked the Thaad in, and then demanded that we pay the cost, too,\u201d Mr. Moon said during a campaign speech on Monday. \u201cDoes this make sense?\u201d Mr. Moon has called for an immediate suspension of the Thaad deployment. Mr. Moon, a liberal, had already pledged to review South Korea\u2019s decision to accept the system if elected. He said South Korea was already paying a heavy price for the Thaad deployment, referring to a boycott of South Korean brands among angry Chinese. The Thaad battery became operational as tension soared on the Korean Peninsula after a series of missile tests by the North and warnings from the Trump administration that military action was not off the table in dealing with the North. Two B-1B American strategic bombers were deployed over the Korean Peninsula on Monday for a joint drill with South Korea\u2019s air force, the South\u2019s Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. North Korea condemned it as a \u201creckless\u201d act that was pushing the peninsula \u201ccloser to the brink of nuclear war,\u201d but Seoul said the exercise was meant to help deter North Korean provocations.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/asia/thaad-north-korea-missile-defense-us.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T03:15:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T03:15:03-04:00", "abstract": "The Thaad system, deployed to confront North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile threats, has angered China and become a contentious issue in South Korea\u2019s presidential race.", "title": "U.S. Antimissile System Goes Live in South Korea"}
