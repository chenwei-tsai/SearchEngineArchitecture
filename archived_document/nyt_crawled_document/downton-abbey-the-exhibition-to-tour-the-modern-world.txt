{"text": "A little more than a year ago, the period drama \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d ended its phenomenally successful six-season run on television. But don\u2019t bid farewell to the Crawley family just yet. The series will live on \u2014 for a few years at least \u2014 in \u201cDownton Abbey: The Exhibition,\u201d presented by NBCUniversal International Studios and by Imagine Exhibitions. The multiyear, worldwide tour will begin at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore on June 17. \u201cViewers all around the world continue to ask for more,\u201d Michael Edelstein, the NBC studio president, said in a statement. \u201cWe are excited to expand the brand in a manner that few TV series could ever dream of doing.\u201d The exhibition, billed as a \u201cjourney through the grand home of Downton Abbey,\u201d will be an interactive glimpse into the lives of the Crawley family, who are British aristocrats, and their staff. Costumes, including the lavish dresses and hats worn by Maggie Smith\u2019s dowager countess, will be on view. Portions of the exhibition will also explore the post-Edwardian historical context of the series, which begins with the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and ends in the mid-1920s. Additional stops on the exhibition tour, which will likely include locations in the United States, will be announced at a later date at downtonexhibition.com.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/television/downton-abbey-the-exhibition-to-tour-the-modern-world.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T13:13:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T13:13:10-04:00", "abstract": "The multiyear, traveling exhibition will open on June 17 at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.", "title": "\u2018Downton Abbey: The Exhibition\u2019 to Tour the Modern World"}
