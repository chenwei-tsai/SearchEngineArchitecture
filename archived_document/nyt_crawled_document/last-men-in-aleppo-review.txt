{"text": "After President Bashar al-Assad of Syria was accused of using sarin gas in an attack on his country\u2019s people, and images of dead children shocked the world, a missile strike on a military airfield ordered by President Trump was celebrated in some of the United States media. The conventional wisdom held that standing up to Mr. Assad would teach a lesson. More than one journalist invoked the notion of beauty in describing the attack. But missiles and bombs do not teach, and are not beautiful. All they make are corpses and rubble. \u201cLast Men in Aleppo,\u201d a documentary both urgent and mournful, opens in the ancient Syrian city of the title, in the aftermath of a barrel-bomb attack by Russian aircraft. Members of the search-and-rescue group known as the White Helmets \u2014 which was also profiled in an  Oscar-winning 2016 short, now streaming on Netflix \u2014 comb through the ruins of a building, eventually extracting a baby who survived its collapse. This is only the first of many such scenes. The repetition would be numbing if each did not yield a new horror. An infant, dead, its neck snapped, its head flopping, as a volunteer hoists the body. A calico cat with its back limbs pulverized, trying to scurry out of a corridor and into shelter \u2014 where? Nowhere. And so it goes. The movie, directed by Feras Fayyad, with Steen Johannessen as co-director, takes a direct, often galvanizing cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 perspective, some artfully shot opening and interstitial footage notwithstanding. In one scene, the movie\u2019s central figures, Khaled, a warm, bearish father of two, and Mahmoud, an intense younger man, are trying to douse a car fire when their White Helmets crew, and a camera operator, come under attack and have to run for cover. It\u2019s terrifying. Khaled\u2019s sweet young daughters provide respite, but their presence also increases a sense of dread. These are beautiful, kind human beings. We don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to them. But from where we sit in a movie theater, there\u2019s nothing to be done. This is an essential film, but it is also a terribly dispiriting one. We all navigate challenges and endure loss, but \u201cLast Men in Aleppo\u201d is likely to make you almost ashamed of your comforts and leave you with a feeling of impotence. I suspect it\u2019s the filmmakers\u2019 wish that once those initial feelings ebb, moviegoers will ask what they can do to help. This picture doesn\u2019t offer hope; its aim is to compel us to create some.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/movies/last-men-in-aleppo-review.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T16:23:43-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-05-02T16:20:43-04:00", "abstract": "A documentary about the Syrian civil war focuses on members of a search-and-rescue group that digs for bodies after buildings have been bombed.", "title": "Review: \u2018Last Men in Aleppo,\u2019 Models of Courage Under Fire"}
