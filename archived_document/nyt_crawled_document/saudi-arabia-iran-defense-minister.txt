{"text": "Saudi Arabia accused Iran on Tuesday of coveting control of the Muslim world and said dialogue with its Middle Eastern rival was impossible. The Saudi criticism, made in a television interview by its defense minister, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was unusually blunt and suggested that the strained relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran may worsen, increasing instability in the region. Saudi Arabia, predominantly Sunni Muslim, and Iran, predominantly Shiite, support opposite sides in the wars in Syria and Yemen and a simmering conflict in Bahrain. The Saudis are strong allies of the United States. They have been heartened by the Trump administration\u2019s confrontational stance toward the Iranians compared with that of President Barack Obama\u2019s. Saudi-Iranian relations hit a low in 2016 when the Saudis severed diplomatic relations with Iran after the Saudi Embassy in Tehran was stormed by Iranian rioters, outraged over the Saudi execution of an outspoken Shiite cleric. Signs of a Saudi-Iranian thaw emerged a few months ago when the Saudis said Iranians would be able to participate in this year\u2019s hajj, the pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. No Iranians attended the 2016 hajj, partly because of tensions over a human crush at the 2015 hajj that left more than 2,400 dead, including nearly 500 Iranians. But the Saudi prince appeared to douse any prospect of further improvement in the interview with the Saudi-owned MBC television. Excerpts were distributed to Western and Arab news agencies before the broadcast of the full interview Tuesday night. Asked if a direct dialogue is envisioned with Iran, the prince said that would be impossible because of what he described as the Iranian religious conviction that Shiites were destined to take over the Islamic world. \u201cHow do you have a dialogue with this?\u201d the prince said. He was referring to the Shiite belief in Imam Mahdi, the so-called Hidden Imam, said to be a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad who will return to save the world from destruction. The prince said Iranians believe that \u201cthe Imam Mahdi will come and they must prepare the fertile environment for the arrival of the awaited Mahdi and they must control the Muslim world.\u201d Roughly a quarter of the global population of 7.5 billion is Muslim, the vast majority Sunni. There was no immediate response to the prince\u2019s remarks from Iran. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, said recently that his country has no fight to pick with Saudi Arabia, but he accused the Saudis of \u201cfueling tensions in the region through their policies and stances.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-defense-minister.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T13:27:40-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T13:27:40-04:00", "abstract": "Prince Mohammed bin Salman accused Iran of seeking to control the Muslim world and appeared to rule out reconciliation between the Middle Eastern rivals.", "title": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Defense Minister Says Dialogue With Iran Is Impossible"}
