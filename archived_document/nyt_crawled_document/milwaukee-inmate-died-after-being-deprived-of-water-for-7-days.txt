{"updated_date": "2017-04-25T16:51:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "section": "U.S.", "abstract": "A weeklong hearing is being held as officials consider charges against jail workers in the dehydration death of Terrill Thomas, 38, in April 2016.", "text": "Inmates, correction officers and investigators are testifying in Milwaukee this week to help determine whether jail employees will be charged with abuse in the dehydration death of an inmate who the authorities say was deprived of water for a week. Prosecutors and a lawyer representing the estate of the inmate, Terrill Thomas, say that correction officers turned off the man\u2019s water supply in an isolation cell in April 2016, and that he was unable to ask for help because he was having a mental health crisis. He died on April 24, 2016. In March, the Milwaukee County district attorney\u2019s office requested an inquest, a relatively uncommon legal procedure in which a cause of death is examined for possible criminal charges. After a week of testimony, jurors will decide whether to recommend charges against jail employees, though the district attorney is not bound by the recommendation. Erik Heipt, the lawyer representing Mr. Thomas\u2019s estate, said in an interview on Monday that Mr. Thomas, 38, had bipolar disorder, and that \u201che was not operating in a world of reality\u201d when he was jailed. \u201cHe needed mental health treatment, but instead of the jail treating his very serious mental health needs, they responded by punishing him for acting out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey treated his mental illness as a behavioral problem and disciplined him.\u201d Mr. Thomas was arrested on April 15, 2016, on charges that he shot a man and later fired two gunshots inside the Potawatomi Hotel & Casino, according to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. He was placed in a cell at the Milwaukee County Jail with no mattress, blanket or pillow, Mr. Heipt said. There was a toilet, but it wouldn\u2019t flush after the water was turned off, he said. Mr. Thomas was not given drinks with his food, which was an unsavory, brick-shaped dish called \u201cNutraloaf\u201d that some states have banned. He did not eat the meals and lost at least 30 pounds, Mr. Heipt said. While other inmates told correction officers that Mr. Thomas needed water, Mr. Thomas could not advocate this himself, Mr. Heipt said. On April 24, Mr. Thomas was found dead on the floor of his cell. \u201cInmates are at the mercy of their jailers for basic life-sustaining necessities like water, food and medical care,\u201d a court filing signed by Kurt Benkley, an assistant district attorney, said in March. \u201cWhen a mentally ill inmate, like Mr. Thomas, is locked in solitary confinement without access to water, his life is totally in his jailers\u2019 hands.\u201d The sheriff\u2019s office did not respond to messages on Tuesday seeking comment. Mr. Benkley said at the opening of the inquest on Monday that video showed three officers turning off the water in Mr. Thomas\u2019s cell as punishment for flooding another cell,  The Journal Sentinel reported. The officers did not notify supervisors or document the cutoff, Mr. Benkley said. \u201cThis order to shut off Mr. Thomas\u2019s water was highly irregular and contrary to standard operating procedure in the jail,\u201d the assistant district attorney said, according to the newspaper. Two correction officers who testified on Monday said they were unaware that the water in Mr. Thomas\u2019s cell had been turned off, according to Fox 6, a Milwaukee television station. Mr. Heipt said he planned to file a federal civil rights case on behalf of Mr. Thomas\u2019s estate, and one of Mr. Thomas\u2019s children has filed a separate federal civil suit against Sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee County and his staff. Mr. Clarke gained national prominence last year as one of President Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters in law enforcement, delivering a speech at the Republican National Convention in which he declared, \u201cBlue lives matter.\u201d Mr. Heipt praised the district attorney\u2019s office for \u201creally digging deeply into this,\u201d which he described as unusual for abuse that\u2019s reported behind bars. Families who believe their loved ones were abused often have trouble getting prosecutions, and typically rely more on the civil court system, where they can obtain monetary damages, he said. While public interest in police shootings has grown in recent years, abuse in the prison system is more likely to remain hidden from the public, he said. That\u2019s partly because police shootings in public spaces are often captured by videos that go viral and stoke widespread calls for justice, he said. \u201cThat type of evidence doesn\u2019t always exist in jail-related deaths, and so the people are often not demanding the same level of accountability,\u201d Mr. Heipt said. \u201cThese things are often poorly investigated and get swept under the rug, and the citizens don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/us/milwaukee-inmate-died-after-being-deprived-of-water-for-7-days.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:51:00-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "Milwaukee Inmate Died After Being Deprived of Water for 7 Days", "item_type": "Article"}
