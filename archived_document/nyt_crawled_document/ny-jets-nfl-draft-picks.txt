{"text": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 Mike Maccagnan was jealous. Jealous of another N.F.L. general manager, whose team had more draft picks than the Jets, who were set to enter the first round of the N.F.L. draft on Thursday with seven, including No. 6 over all and four of the top 107, and coveted more. Pick envy, Maccagnan called it on Monday, and though he would not say how many choices would appease him, he subscribes to Bill Belichick\u2019s philosophy in New England: The more picks a team has, the better chance it has of landing productive players. And the Jets, after bumbling to 5-11 last season and purging their roster of high-priced talent like receiver Brandon Marshall and center Nick Mangold, need productive players. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel any different pressure,\u201d Maccagnan said. His options on Thursday are plentiful. In the first round, the Jets could take a quarterback, a cornerback, a safety, an edge rusher, a tight end or a running back \u2014 either at sixth or later, should they trade down to amass more picks, as Maccagnan desired. Maccagnan\u2019s first two drafts have yielded a few encouraging players \u2014 most notably defensive lineman Leonard Williams, the team\u2019s most valuable player last season. But Maccagnan said he would be judged, like his predecessors, on his ability to identify a long-term starter at quarterback. Last year, he used a second-round pick on a project, Christian Hackenberg, whose presence and potential hardly dissuaded the Jets from holding private workouts for the top four quarterbacks: Mitchell Trubisky (North Carolina), Deshaun Watson (Clemson), Patrick Mahomes (Texas Tech) and DeShone Kizer (Notre Dame). Maccagnan dismissed the Jets\u2019 extensive legwork as routine preparation, saying the importance of the position demanded a thorough search every year. But teams with stable or promising quarterback situations \u2014 Josh McCown, who turns 38 in July and was 2-20 as a starter across the last three seasons, is atop the depth chart \u2014 do not invest that kind of time and effort unless their interest is sincere. Maccagnan has chosen a quarterback in the last two drafts \u2014 Bryce Petty, in the fourth round in 2015, preceded Hackenberg \u2014 and it stands to reason he will seriously consider taking another this year. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a referendum on one or another player,\u201d Maccagnan said of Hackenberg. \u201cI think it\u2019s until you\u2019re in a position where you feel, \u2018Hey, this is where you\u2019re at,\u2019 and we\u2019re not at that position yet. But I mean, we may be. Time will tell.\u201d Mike Mayock, a draft analyst for NFL Network, said in a recent conference call that none of the quarterbacks merited a high first-round grade. But teams are bound to take one early anyway, and if the Jets decide not to, they could collect a bounty of picks in exchange for the right to select Trubisky. A possible partner, then, could be Cleveland, which has the No. 1 pick but would deal its No. 12 pick. The Browns also hold the first selection in Friday\u2019s second round, No. 33, which would appeal to the Jets, who could either take the best player on their board or trade it again, for even more choices. Beyond quarterback, the Jets\u2019 most pressing need is to improve a secondary that lacks depth and quality and whose struggles compromised Coach Todd Bowles\u2019s ability to blitz. They lack a top cornerback and a dynamic safety, but this draft is loaded with potential solutions, including cornerbacks Marshon Lattimore (Ohio State), Gareon Conley (Ohio State) and Tre\u2019Davious White (Louisiana State) and safeties Jamal Adams (L.S.U.) and Malik Hooker (Ohio State). Should the Jets buck a recent trend and select an offensive player in the first round for the first time since 2009, when they traded up with Cleveland to select Mark Sanchez, two tantalizing options would be L.S.U. running back Leonard Fournette and Alabama tight end O.J. Howard, who could transform a position that accounted for only 26 receptions over the last two seasons. Maccagnan has said he does not draft based on need because incorporating that variable can skew his evaluation process, but this year figures to be different. As he attempts to rebuild the Jets, with their seven (or more) picks, it would be a challenge not to.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/sports/football/ny-jets-nfl-draft-picks.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T12:33:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T12:33:54-04:00", "abstract": "With needs at quarterback, cornerback and safety, the Jets were set to enter the draft with seven picks, and coveted more.", "title": "In N.F.L.
