To which many may ask: Who? The Israeli designer doesn\u2019t stage fashion shows. She doesn\u2019t shoot ad campaigns or pay for them to run in magazines, and she doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time kissing up to the people who run them, who decide which clothes to feature and which to forget. Her clothes aren\u2019t flashy or splashy: They are neutral, well considered, the sort of thing those magazines like to euphemize as \u201celevated basics,\u201d as if there were anything basic about making something women want to wear every day. After 14 years in business, she is successful enough to keep her two other stores (in TriBeCa and in East Hampton, N.Y.) and sell briskly at department stores, but mostly in her own quiet way. \u201cIn our crowd, in the fashion circles we work in, so few people know about her,\u201d her friend, the photographer Inez van Lamsweerde, said. \u201cThey\u2019re blown away by the sense of fashion, but also the fact that you could actually live your life in it.\u201d She met Ms. Lotan after Emmanuelle Alt, the editor of Vogue Paris, saw Ms. van Lamsweerde wearing her designs and demanded to know whose they were. Ms. Lotan happened to be in the boutique when they visited, and a friendship developed. \u201cWhen I would say to other friends of mine, not in fashion, \u2018I found this incredible designer,\u2019 everyone says, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019ve been buying her pants for the last 10 years,\u2019\u201d Ms. van Lamsweerde said. \u201cI missed that.\u201d But in the past year or two, something happened. Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner \u2014 supermodels, super-friends and Instagram juggernauts for whose endorsements brands pay handsomely \u2014 discovered Ms. Lotan\u2019s clothes. As the celebrities wore her slouchy sweaters or her silk camisole dresses, their fans clamored after Ms. Lotan, and swelled her numbers on Instagram. \u201cI started to look at who is following me more in depth,\u201d Ms. Lotan said. A majority are women between ages 24 and 34. \u201cIt could be as a result of Kendall and Gigi,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that they brought all this younger crowd.\u201d This younger crowd is not necessarily the one Ms. Lotan has in mind when designing, and it is not necessarily one that can afford her designer-level prices. So, taken with the digital experience (not to mention the migration of a significant part of her business from in-store to online), Ms. Lotan hit on the idea for her new temporary Mercer Street shop: a brick-and-mortar extension of her e-commerce platform, with new pieces priced lower than her usual for the young new fans who otherwise swarm her sample sales, hoping for deals. In her new space, Ms. Lotan seeks to emulate the speed and ease of online shopping. Orders will be taken on iPads, without cash being exchanged, and purchases can be carried out, shipped or delivered the same day in the New York metropolitan area. Each month, a new theme will take over the store: To begin, a feather motif inspired by Emily Dickinson\u2019s poem known as \u201cHope Is the Thing With Feathers,\u201d which also gave rise to a photo shoot by Ms. van Lamsweerde and her husband, Vinoodh Matadin, the results of which line the walls. \u201cThe past year I\u2019ve been walking around feeling constant concern,\u201d Ms. Lotan said. \u201cThe only thing I could do to feel better was think about the word \u2018hope.\u2019\u201d But that\u2019s this month. Next month comes camouflage. And the next, riffing on her communities, TriBeCa and Tel Aviv. Ms. Lotan lives and works in TriBeCa with her husband, the Israeli singer-songwriter David Broza, a superstar in their native country who is sometimes called \u201cIsrael\u2019s Bruce Springsteen.\u201d (Ms. Hadid, for the record, is half-Palestinian; Mr. Broza has been a vocal activist in song for Israeli-Palestinian peace; and Ms. Lotan is involved with the organization Women Wage Peace, and will host a benefit for it in the store.) The shop will stay open through August, when it will become a kind of traveling caravan, opening its doors wherever Ms. Lotan finds an outlet. Toronto has already been booked. She hopes Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Tel Aviv are to come. For the younger fans looking for the lower-priced items, starting at $98 for a T-shirt, they will be available (and in limited quantities) only at these pop-ups, and, for those who cannot get to one, online. In honor of Ms. Hadid, Ms. Lotan has renamed an Aran sweater that the model wore in her honor, and at the opening, a rack of the silk cami dresses she favors hangs in a new rainbow array. But, Ms. Lotan added, the two have still never met.", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
