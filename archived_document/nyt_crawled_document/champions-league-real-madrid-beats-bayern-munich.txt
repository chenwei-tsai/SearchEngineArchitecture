A bizarre own goal by Real Madrid\u2019s Sergio Ramos forced extra time after Robert Lewandowski opened the scoring for Bayern from the penalty spot and Ronaldo tied it. Marcelo twice cleared shots off the line for Madrid, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng did the same for Bayern in a thrilling game, which was tilted in Madrid\u2019s favor after Arturo Vidal was sent off for two yellow cards, the second of which was bitterly contested by Bayern\u2019s players. Ronaldo put Madrid level at 2-2 on the night \u2014 and ahead on aggregate \u2014 in the first period of extra time with his 100th Champions League goal, but from a clearly offside position. He wrapped up his hat trick in the second extra period \u2014 again with a goal that appeared to be offside \u2014 before Marco Asensio added Madrid\u2019s fourth.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/sports/soccer/champions-league-real-madrid-beats-bayern-munich.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T17:49:20-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Champions League: Real Madrid Eliminates Bayern Munich", "created_date": "2017-04-18T17:49:20-04:00", "section": "Sports"}
