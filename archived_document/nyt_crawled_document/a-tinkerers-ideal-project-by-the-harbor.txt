{"text": "William Rhodes wanted to buy a single-family house in Fairfield County, Conn., not far from where he grew up in Darien. \u201cI wanted to do some fixing,\u201d said Mr. Rhodes, who is known to his friends as Tip. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be move-in-ready and immaculate.\u201d He and his girlfriend, Victoria Walsh, had been renting in Darien, which was far too expensive. There, a $700,000 house was on the low end of the market \u2014 \u201cand that was a knock-down, start-from-scratch kind of place,\u201d he said. His budget was up to $400,000. Norwalk was a realistic choice. Mr. Rhodes, 32, a University of Connecticut graduate who is now a financial products salesman in Shelton, Conn., studied listings for a few years. Early last fall, having saved diligently, he visited a three-bedroom house new to the market, not far from Norwalk Harbor. The 1925 house seemed to need just the right amount of work. \u201cIt was not hazardous, but plaster walls were falling apart and needed to be patched,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. The stains and smells of once-resident pets had soaked through the carpeting and were visible on the floors. The house did not seem to need exterior work, like roofing or siding. The asking price was $400,000. Mr. Rhodes returned with Sue Okie, a friend\u2019s mother, who is a sales associate at the Darien office of Halstead Connecticut. Because of the house\u2019s condition, he offered $330,000. The counteroffer was $395,000. No deal. Mr. Rhodes checked out an 1840 house on Silvermine Avenue, marked with a plaque. The price of the three-bedroom had dropped to $330,000 from $400,000. Mr. Rhodes was concerned about the house\u2019s age. \u201cIt felt like you could open up a wall and find compounding issues,\u201d he said. \u201cSo where it was maybe a little less on the budget at first, I was concerned it would be much more on the budget in the long run.\u201d The house sold for $300,000. Another option was a 1959 bank-owned four-bedroom house on Old Belden Hill Road. The exterior was rundown, and he was reluctant \u201cto be diving into that type of a project,\u201d he said. The yard, though large, was overgrown with vines and brush. Its slope made it unsuitable for a picnic table, he said. The house sold for $347,000 to Dan Raposo, a Realtor at the Higgins Group, a realty, and an investor in RPM Homes, which buys and flips single-family homes. \u201cTo me, this was a moderate rehab,\u201d Mr. Raposo said. \u201cAn extensive renovation is stripping everything down to the studs and doing everything all over again.\u201d The roof was replaced and the siding repaired. \u201cWe took out two Dumpsters of just yard debris,\u201d he said. The house, now in move-in condition, Mr. Raposo said, is on the market for $499,000. Meanwhile, the house near the harbor kept drawing Mr. Rhodes back. \u201cThere was a lot of upside potential,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of work was in the realm of my capabilities.\u201d He liked the area. \u201cYou can walk the dog and say hello to the neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the best choice out of what I\u2019d seen.\u201d A few weeks later, Mr. Rhodes offered $365,000. Another offer had just been received. So he raised his offer to $390,000, which was accepted. The inspection found pipes that needed replacing, and \u201csome areas of concern that weren\u2019t issues yet, like keep-your-eye-on-them scenarios,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. He also had a septic inspection. \u201cThankfully I did, because it was barely in working order, so the sellers replaced the whole septic system,\u201d he said. Mr. Rhodes closed last winter and since then has been fixing, patching, painting and cleaning, with the help of Ms. Walsh and others. \u201cHe always loved a project and is constantly tinkering with things,\u201d Ms. Walsh said. Contractors did plumbing and electrical work, refinished the floors and installed a new kitchen. Critiques? The garage is better suited to storage than a car. Ms. Walsh would have preferred a second full bathroom to the half-bath they now have. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I was fully prepared for the effort I put forth,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cI had to figure out how to hang a shower curtain on an angled ceiling. But I am extremely pleased with the results.\u201d He sacrificed a big yard in favor of proximity to the water. \u201cIt is certainly a fair trade-off in my book,\u201d he said. The house has second-floor water views in the winter. Lars, a miniature schnauzer, is adapting to his new space. \u201cHe is trying to figure out where he can sleep and where his little pet beds are,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new lifestyle for him in that regard.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/realestate/a-tinkerers-ideal-project-by-the-harbor.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Real Estate", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:10-04:00", "abstract": "Tip Rhodes wanted a house to fix up, and he found one in Norwalk, Conn.", "title": "A Tinkerer\u2019s Ideal Project, by the Harbor"}
