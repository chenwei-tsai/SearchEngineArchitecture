{"text": "Philadelphia \u2014 Last week, a hashtag called #ThingsOnlyWomenWritersHear zipped around Twitter, giving women the chance to share the condescension and the cluelessness that writing while female guarantees. There were assumptions about how everything a woman writes is automatically chick lit, links to the latest essays about great American novelists that failed to mention women, and tweets like \u201cI loved your article \u2014 did you write it while the baby napped?\u201d And of course, there was the assumption that every protagonist a woman writes is her and that every plot is something she experienced, even if the protagonist is a space alien and the \u201csomething\u201d is the Civil War. Men invent; women transcribe. Men\u2019s books are windows onto some grander, more universal experience; women\u2019s books are mirrors, reflecting the author\u2019s own eating, praying and loving. It\u2019s the kind of thing you hate to see happen to any writer. Until that writer is the deposed Fox News bloviator Bill O\u2019Reilly. Mr. O\u2019Reilly, of course, has been in slow-motion free-fall ever since this paper reported that Fox had paid more than $13 million to five female colleagues who had accused him of sexual harassment. He lost his job. He lost his reputation. And then things got really bad: Critics and comics rediscovered the novel he had published back in 1998 \u2014 before the tomes on Reagan, Lincoln and Jesus \u2014 and Bill O\u2019Reilly got treated as if he writes like a girl. The degradation began with Stephen Colbert\u2019s riff on the book, \u201cThose Who Trespass,\u201d which stars \u201ca brash TV journalist, named Shannon Michaels, who is fired from his network news job\u201d and who, as one does, goes on a homicidal killing spree. \u201cHis career was the source of his feelings of omnipotence and grandiosity,\u201d Mr. Colbert quoted. \u201cBeing on TV was like a drug to him, and when it was taken away from him he had to find a substitute drug: planning and carrying out the executions of those people who had humiliated him.\u201d \u201cBill \u2026 buddy \u2026 hello, handsome,\u201d Mr. Colbert said, \u201cI just want to point out \u2014 I never humiliated you, O.K.?\u201d Jia Tolentino at The New Yorker noted that the book \u201cfeels transparently personal\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s impossible to take in the steady stream of coldly rendered violence in O\u2019Reilly\u2019s novel\u201d without thinking of the writer himself. The implications of the New Yorker piece are clear: Bill O\u2019Reilly did not invent the character of a homicidal newsman. Bill O\u2019Reilly is a homicidal newsman. For all we know, he might just kill his former colleagues in the improbable ways explicated in \u201cThose Who Trespass.\u201d Watch out for that iced-tea-stirring spoon, Gretchen Carlson! Stay away from open windows, Megyn Kelly! Even though he\u2019d been fired, even though he\u2019d been shamed, even though his inability to distinguish between a loofah and a falafel, and which one you\u2019d use on a naked woman, had already been revealed in a lawsuit, this was a new realm of humiliation to explore. But equating the narrator with the author is only one of many risks of writing while female, and I hope that as Mr. O\u2019Reilly continues to remain in the public eye and promote his other titles, he\u2019ll get to experience more of them. I hope some reporter asks Mr. O\u2019Reilly how his ex-wife, or his former boss, felt about those pornographic descriptions of violence. I hope an interviewer will point out \u2014 as if he\u2019d never thought about it himself \u2014 that someday, his kids might read the book, and ask what he\u2019s going to tell them when they do. I hope he\u2019s forced to talk about how he managed his marriage and family while he was working full-time and writing on the side. I hope he has to explain who did the housework when he did his book tour and who watched the kids while he wrote. I hope that someone tells him, before he gets his next author photo taken, that he\u2019d sell more books if he smiled. This seems, alas, unlikely. Mr. O\u2019Reilly is said to have gotten as much as $25 million for leaving Fox, and the right to maintain that the sexual harassment claims are \u201ccompletely unfounded\u201d and that his accusers are a pack of mendacious liars looking for an easy payday from a vulnerable public figure. \u201cI\u2019ve been treated unfairly,\u201d is his rallying cry, even as his publisher continues to put out his books, even as those books continue to top the best-seller list. Real unfairness, of course, is when a man can be accused of victimizing and harassing female colleagues for decades and face absolutely no consequences until his bad behavior affects his company\u2019s bottom line. I hope that every reporter and critic who covers Mr. O\u2019Reilly the author will ask Mr. O\u2019Reilly the newsman about these misdeeds. And if that doesn\u2019t happen? I hope that every profile makes careful note of his shoes and his clothing. I hope every reporter asks about his work-life balance, and every stranger at every cocktail party and back-to-school night asks how his loved ones felt about all of that kinky sex and gaudy violence. I hope that a man who got away with mistreating female colleagues spends the rest of his writing life being treated like a girl.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/bill-oreilly-and-the-revenge-of-chick-lit.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T03:21:15-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-04-28T03:21:15-04:00", "abstract": "Treat him the way women have always been treated.", "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly and the Revenge of Chick Lit"}
