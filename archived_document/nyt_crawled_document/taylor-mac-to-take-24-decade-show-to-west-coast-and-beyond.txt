The show, a finalist for the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, is a decade-by-decade walk through American history from 1776 to 2016, told through the songs of the time, all reinterpreted through a radical queer lens. The roughly 700 people who saw the show in one continuous 24-hour marathon last October at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn will still have bragging rights. But audiences in San Francisco can see it in four segments presented between Sept. 15 and 24 at the newly restored Curran Theater there, followed by an abridged concert version at Stanford University on Sept. 27. The entire show will be presented again next spring in six-hour segments at the Theater at Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, from March 15 to 24. There will also be abridged performances at the Kennedy Center in Washington on March 6, 2018, and at Arizona State University in Tempe on April 27, 2018. Wesley Morris, reviewing it in The New York Times, called the marathon \u2014 which featured shared audience meals, group dance breaks and, for weaklings, a sleeping loft \u2014 \u201cone of the great experiences of my life.\u201d In addition to the Pulitzer nod, the show (produced by Pomegranate Arts) won the Edward M. Kennedy Award for Drama Inspired by American History. Some of the elements, which include an adaptation of \u201cThe Mikado\u201d set on Mars and what a news release calls \u201cthe queerest Civil War re-enactment in history,\u201d will be restaged, depending on the design of each venue. But Mr. Mac, in a statement, said the San Francisco dates, in particular, represented a return to his roots. \u201cThe impetus for this piece began in San Francisco, when I participated in the first AIDS walk in 1986,\u201d he said. Combining members of his New York company with local Bay Area artists, he added, \u201callows the form of the creation to mirror the content of the work: a community building itself through the performance of all that history and music on our backs.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T13:01:18-04:00", "section": "Theater", "abstract": "Mr. Mac\u2019s \u201cA 24-Decade History of Popular Music\u201d will be performed in San Francisco and Los Angeles, with abridged versions staged elsewhere.", "item_type": "Article"}
