{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here\u2019s the latest.  1. President Trump\u2019s push to get a new health care bill through the House was dealt a huge blow by an influential Republican who refused to support it. The lawmaker said it \u201ctorpedoes\u201d protections for people with pre-existing conditions, who are also speaking out against the bill \u2014 and so is the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. He gave a moving monologue about his newborn son, Billy, who has a heart defect. Speaker Paul Ryan offered no indication when a vote might be held. _____ 2. On Twitter, President Trump\u2019s comments focused on federal spending. He said the country needed \u201ca good \u2018shutdown\u2019\u201d this fall to force a partisan confrontation on the issue. And he discussed Syria with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by phone, agreeing to work together on a cease-fire deal. It was their first conversation since the rupture in relations over the American cruise missile strike in Syria last month. _____ 3. Hillary Clinton declared herself \u201cpart of the resistance\u201d to President Trump. At a live event for a women\u2019s nonprofit, Mrs. Clinton sharply questioned the president\u2019s conduct in office and blamed the timing of an FBI inquiry into her email use for her election loss. \u201cIf the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,\u201d she said. _____ 4. Speaking of women in the White House, Ivanka Trump says she wants to be a moderating force. Here\u2019s a look at her West Wing agenda. Ms. Trump granted us two interviews ahead of the release of her new advice book, \u201cWomen Who Work.\u201d Our critic called it \u201ca strawberry milkshake of inspirational quotes.\u201d _____ 5. Video from police body cameras could be crucial in the investigation into a fatal police shooting of a 15-year-old in Texas. Jordan Edwards was in a car leaving the area of a house party east of Dallas on Saturday night when he was shot in the head. The officers had been responding to reports of underage drinking. Jordan\u2019s family released a statement saying his brothers \u201cwitnessed firsthand his violent, senseless murder\u201d and asking people to refrain from protests in his name. _____ 6. Kentucky could soon become the only state without a single abortion clinic. There\u2019s only one in operation now. The state\u2019s governor, who calls himself \u201cunapologetically pro-life,\u201d is threatening to close it. \u201cWe are under assault,\u201d said the doctor who founded the clinic. _____ 7. Doctors hope nine sets of twins identified in Brazil\u2019s Zika crisis will shed light on the virus. Six of them are fraternal sets, in which one baby got microcephaly, while the other appears unaffected. That\u2019s the case of Jo\u00e3o Lucas and his sister, Ana Vit\u00f3ria, above, who are a year old. _____ 8. The offbeat pop opera \u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812\u201d earned 12 Tony nominations, more than any other show. The more old-fashioned \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d wasn\u2019t far behind, with 10, including for its stars, Bette Midler and David Hyde Pierce. Kevin Spacey will host the awards ceremony on June 11. _____ 9. Trekking season in the Himalayas produces tales of physical endurance and heartbreak every year. They are rarely as extreme as that of Liang Sheng-Yueh, above, and Liu Chen Chi. The Taiwanese university students were stranded in a remote cave for more than six weeks. Ms. Liu died just days before rescuers arrived, but Mr. Liang was alive. He was taken to the hospital and is recovering. _____ 10. Finally, Rosa Parks\u2019s old house in Detroit has been saved from demolition. Also, it was moved to Berlin. An American artist who lives in Berlin took apart the house, shipped it overseas and put it back together. Now it\u2019s open to the public, and visitors are flocking there. \u201cIt was an act of love,\u201d he said. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
