{"text": "As a mom who lost her son to suicide in 2013, a Houston nurse became concerned when she heard about the popular Netflix show \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d By then her 15-year-old daughter had already binge-watched it. In the series, the character Hannah Baker kills herself in despair, leaving audiotapes for the people she holds responsible, among them, her rapist, fickle friends and bullies. The tapes are part justification for her suicide and part vengeful accusation of her peers. But in the month since the show\u2019s release, a rising chorus of mental health experts contend that too many of the show\u2019s messages on suicide are inaccurate and potentially dangerous. Superintendents and school counselors around the country have issued warnings to parents that \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d glorifies suicide and could lead to an increase in copycat behavior and self-harm among vulnerable students. \u201cWe are concerned about our children watching this series without adult supervision because it romanticizes and sensationalizes the idea of suicide,\u201d Lisa Brady, superintendent of schools in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., wrote in an email to parents. Its creators have defended the show, saying they aimed to make the drama helpful to struggling kids. But for the nurse\u2019s family, the show has been devastating. Her daughter, who found her brother\u2019s body, has been working through depression and trauma ever since. With treatment and regular therapy, things got better \u2014 until she watched \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d Now the show has triggered new thoughts of despair and suicide in her daughter, she said. \u201cIf I\u2019d known about the show beforehand I would have monitored her Netflix account a bit more,\u201d said the nurse, whose name is being withheld to protect her daughter\u2019s privacy. \u201cIf kids have a history of depression, self-harm or suicidal thoughts, I don\u2019t think they need to watch it.\u201d On Friday, in a letter to parents, Robert Avossa, superintendent of Palm Beach County schools in Florida, reported that his employees have seen an uptick in self-mutilation and threats of suicide among elementary and middle school students since the show began. The Netflix series, which may be renewed for a second season, is based on the 2007 young adult novel \u201cThirteen Reasons Why,\u201d by Jay Asher. It includes a graphic scene in which Hannah kills herself with a razor. Its creators say it\u2019s an unglamorous death, and they worked hard to make sure it wasn\u2019t gratuitous. Netflix has created an accompanying 30-minute documentary \u201cBeyond the Reasons,\u201d that includes the cast, producers and mental health experts discussing some of the show\u2019s more difficult scenes. In the documentary Brian Yorkey, the creator of the series, said, \u201cWe did want it to be painful to watch because we wanted it to be very clear that there is nothing \u2014 in any way \u2014 worthwhile about suicide.\u201d In a statement, Netflix said the writers sought the advice of medical professionals while writing the script, and the show carries a TV-MA rating as well as a warning about graphic content. \u201cOur members tell us that 13 Reasons Why has helped spark important conversations in their families and communities around the world,\u201d the statement said. Some parents have defended the show. Dawn Zawadzki, a paralegal from Fort Mill, S.C., said she watched part of the series with her 16-year-old daughter. \u201cEverybody is saying \u2018it glamorizes suicide,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think it does,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s making us wake up and look at it.\u201d Not everyone agrees. Just before its March 31 release, a producer sought the support of the JED Foundation, a teen suicide prevention group. \u201cI think they were looking for us to say, \u2018It was a great educational tool,\u2019\u201d or that \u201cthey handled the issues in a psychologically helpful way,\u201d said Dr. Victor Schwartz, a psychiatrist and the chief medical officer at the JED Foundation. Ultimately, he could not support what he called \u201cone long revenge story.\u201d The group issued a guide about the show, advising people who choose to watch it to view it with someone else and to take breaks between episodes rather than binge watch. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, because they got a lot of important issues out on the table,\u201d Dr. Schwartz said. But he\u2019s concerned that students could think of suicide as a way to get back at people and worried that showing the specific way Hannah died would spur imitators. \u201cThe missteps are high stakes,\u201d he concluded. The problem, suicide prevention experts said, is that even an ugly suicide can beget copycats. Research has shown that \u201csomeone else\u2019s death by suicide can reinforce a vulnerable person\u2019s motivation to die by suicide,\u201d said Madelyn Gould, a professor of epidemiology and psychiatry at Columbia University. On Instagram, Paris Jackson, a 19-year-old model who has tried to kill herself in the past, called the series, \u201cextremely triggering.\u201d \u201cPlease only watch this show with caution and keep in mind that it may put you in a dark place,\u201d she wrote in a post that got more than 20,000 likes. The National Association of School Psychologists has advised teenagers, who have had suicidal thoughts, to avoid the series entirely. They recommend that any teenager should watch with a parent who can make it clear that suicide is not a solution to problems. The show\u2019s fatalism leaves the impression that suicide can\u2019t be stopped, experts said. In one concerning scene, a character agonizes that he could have done more to help his friend. A school counselor tells him: \u201cIf she wanted to end her life, we weren\u2019t going to stop her.\u201d The statement runs counter to the advice given to teachers and peers about how to help at-risk teens. \u201cFor kids, that action is staying with your friend, not keeping it a secret, and telling a trusted adult,\u201d said Richard Lieberman, who coordinated suicide prevention for Los Angeles Unified School District for 25 years. Another option is to call the National Suicide Prevention line, 1-800-273-8255, or text HOME to 741741. Often suicidal children are scared to tell adults, for fear they won\u2019t be taken seriously, said David N. Miller, the author of \u201cChild and Adolescent Suicidal Behavior: School-Based Prevention, Assessment, and Intervention.\u201d He said, \"the way adults are portrayed as incompetent or clueless\u201d is a major problem in \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d because he thought it would dissuade students from seeking critical assistance. Hours before her death, Hannah goes to see the school counselor, hints that a senior assaulted her, and cryptically says, her eyes welling with tears, that \u201cI need everything to stop, people, life.\u201d He hands her tissues, but doesn\u2019t conduct a suicide-risk assessment or consider hospitalization. \u201cThat was gross negligence,\u201d Dr. Miller said, and it sends \u201ca dangerous message\u201d that adults don\u2019t care. Although the creators of \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d aspired to educate, the show itself never mentions a critical point: most children who die by suicide have a mental health disorder like depression that\u2019s treatable. And throughout the series, as other characters talk of suicide, little is done to address their struggles. \u201cThe series is actually depicting suicide contagion, and at the same time, it\u2019s denying the suicide contagion exists,\u201d Dr. Gould said. It\u2019s \u201cso upsetting to me on so many levels.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/well/family/for-families-of-teens-at-suicide-risk-13-reasons-triggers-concerns.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Well", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T12:57:59-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T12:57:59-04:00", "abstract": "A rising chorus of mental health experts contends that many of the show\u2019s messages on suicide are inaccurate and potentially dangerous.", "title": "For Families of Teens at Suicide Risk, \u201813 Reasons\u2019 Triggers Concerns"}
