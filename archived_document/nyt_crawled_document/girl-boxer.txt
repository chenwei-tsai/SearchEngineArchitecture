{"text": "When I initially read about Jesselyn Silva, known as \u201cJessZilla,\u201d the ambitious young boxer featured in this film, I loved the idea of profiling a young girl\u2019s journey in a male-dominated combat sport. It\u2019s no secret that women\u2019s boxing has nowhere near the participants \u2014 or the money, or the audience \u2014 that men\u2019s boxing has. Broadcasters of the sport generally feature men; the Amateur International Boxing Association has gone so far as to encourage women to box in skirts. The middleweight Olympic champion boxer, Claressa Shields of Flint, Mich., reached the sport\u2019s apogee and still struggles to make herself \u201cmarketable\u201d to sponsors that help translate athletic success to financial reward. There simply is less demand, it seems, to watch girls who like to fight. But Jesselyn boxes because she genuinely loves the sport. She\u2019s only 10, and even though she says she\u2019s dealt with unsupportive schoolmates, she has her eyes on the Olympics. Her odds are decent \u2014 it\u2019s rare for girls to start boxing so young. Though more sign up with age, for now, she mostly spars with boys. But beyond considering the challenges that Jesselyn will face navigating her way through a sport where her presence will generally be an anomaly, I was captivated by the dynamic between her and her father, Pedro. As a filmmaker, I often see profiles of high achieving kids in sports that leave me wondering where their parents fit in all this. When I met them, I immediately understood that Pedro is not the kind of dad who is pushing his daughter to do something she isn\u2019t interested in and, instead, is following his daughter\u2019s lead, supporting her as best he can. Given that this is a film about boxing, I felt it was essential to create a nuanced portrait of their family and to ward off superficial criticisms like, \u201cHow could a man let his cute little girl do such a violent sport?\u201d I thought it was fascinating, for example, that when Pedro says in the film that he wants his daughter\u2019s boxing to end at a certain age, she begins arguing with him about the success she\u2019s looking to have. All families navigate choices like these to some extent. It was clear to me that Jesselyn\u2019s drive was fueled by the love and support of her father. It was also obvious that Pedro is a huge part of Jesselyn\u2019s story, but in no way resembles those hovering \u201chelicopter parents\u201d we hear so much about today. I hope the end result is a work that is as much about girls breaking athletic barriers as parents fostering drive in their children \u2014 encouraging them to do what they love, and to do their best.", "source": "The New York Times", "section": "Opinion", "created_date": "2017-04-18T12:06:36-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/opinion/girl-boxer.html", "title": "Girl Boxer", "item_type": "Article", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "abstract": "Jesselyn Silva is only 10 years old, but she\u2019s already in the ring.", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T12:06:36-04:00"}
