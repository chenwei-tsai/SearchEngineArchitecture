Through the prism of Tuesday\u2019s internet outrage \u2014 pricey jeans that were decorated with fake mud and offered by the retailer Nordstrom \u2014 let\u2019s try to understand what critics said was the biggest problem at Facebook: The social media service\u2019s highly successful and highly algorithmic news feed has split its members into two camps. On one side, the so-called elites see only news that fits with their urban, most likely progressive viewpoints. On the other side are those who see only news that fits with their suburban or rural viewpoints. People who buy designer clothes and pretend to do hard work versus people who actually get their hands (or jeans) dirty. But as Farhad Manjoo points out in a deeply reported magazine piece, fixing those news bubbles isn\u2019t quite so easy. Facebook is driven by data, and in order to get people to see opposing points of views, it might have to do the unthinkable \u2014 disregard the likes and dislikes of its users. But then what? \u201cIf Facebook were to take more significant action, like hiring human editors, creating a reputational system or paying journalists, the company would become something it has long resisted: a media company rather than a neutral tech platform,\u201d Farhad writes.
