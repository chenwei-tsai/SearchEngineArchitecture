{"published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T23:22:53-04:00", "abstract": "Corrections appearing in print on Sunday, April 23, 2017.", "source": "The New York Times", "section": "Corrections", "created_date": "2017-04-22T23:20:53-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Correction", "text": "FRONT PAGE An article last Sunday about efforts to investigate and prosecute cases of war crimes committed in Syria referred incorrectly to a case against Syrian officials that has been filed in a court in Spain. It is one of such cases pending, but not the only one. (Investigations are also open in France and Germany.) NATIONAL An article last Sunday about the hacking group Shadow Brokers\u2019 release of a trove of highly classified hacking tools used to break into Microsoft systems, which may have been used by the National Security Agency, referred incorrectly to software that was not affected by N.S.A. hacking tools. It is Windows 10, not Microsoft 10. (There is no such software by that name.) ARTS & LEISURE An article on Page 24 this weekend about the exhibition \u201cCalder/Mir\u00f3: Constellations,\u201d using information from Acquavella Galleries, misstates the number of paintings by Mir\u00f3 in the show. It is 22, not 23. (One painting that was to have been on loan to Acquavella was withdrawn and the gallery substituted a print; The Times discovered the change after the section had gone to press.) \u2022 An article last Sunday about political television shows in the Trump era misspelled, on first reference, the name of a \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d showrunner. She is Melissa James Gibson, not Melissa Jane Gibson. T: CULTURE An article on Page 114 this weekend about the quirky, unconventional work of the French artist Sophie Calle, which blurs the distinction between art and life, misidentifies the medium in which her \u201cThe Birthday Ceremony\u201d series and her \u201cVoir la mer\u201d series were made. \u201cThe Birthday Ceremony\u201d is comprised of sculptures, not photographs, and \u201cVoir la mer\u201d is comprised of digital films, not photographs. The article also omits part of the title of a Calle show. It is \u201cMy Mother, My Cat, My Father, in that order\u201d \u2014 not merely \u201cMy Mother, My Cat, My Father.\u201d In addition, the article misstates the year a show by Calle will open at the Mus\u00e9e de la Chasse et de la Nature. It will be shown starting in October 2017, not 2018. The article also misstates part of the name of the organization curating Calle\u2019s upcoming show \u201cSophie Calle: Missing.\u201d It is Ars Citizen, not Arts Citizen. And, finally, the article refers incorrectly to Calle\u2019s connection to a burial plot at Green-Wood cemetery in Brooklyn. She was offered the plot as part of a site-specific project she is making there; she has not bought a burial plot there. MAGAZINE An article on April 9 about CNN misidentified the news outlet that first reported the existence of an intelligence dossier containing private information that Russia was said to have collected on Donald Trump. It was reported by the magazine Mother Jones, not by CNN. (CNN later broke the news that United States intelligence officials had briefed President-elect Trump on the possibility that Russia had compromising information about his activities.) \u2022 An article on April 16 about Japanese photography after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster misidentified the medium in which Shimpei Takeda made photograms from radioactive soil. He exposed the soil to photosensitive film, not photosensitive paper. TRAVEL An article last Sunday about French influences in Harlem misidentified the birthplace of Fabrice Warin, owner of Barawine Harlem. He was born in Bordeaux, not in Alsace. \u2022 An article last Sunday about drinking in Brno, Czech Republic, referred incorrectly to the city\u2019s location. It is southeast of Prague, not southwest. \u2022 The Frugal Traveler column last Sunday, about Pittsburgh, misidentified the location of the Akers National Roll company. It is in Avon-more, Pa., not Avondale. \u2022 An article on April 9 about southern Laos rendered the name of a local beer incorrectly. It is Beerlao, not Beer Lao. BOOK REVIEW  The Roving Eye feature on April 9 attributed an erroneous distinction to \u201cGhachar Ghochar,\u201d a novella by Vivek Shanbhag. It is one of the first books originally written in the Kannada language to be published in America, but not the first. There has been at least one earlier, \u201cSamskara,\u201d by U. R. Anantha Murthy, first published here by Oxford University Press in 1976. \u2022 A review on April 9 about Paul Watson\u2019s \u201cIce Ghosts: The Epic Hunt for the Lost Franklin Expedition\u201d misstated the role that Jim Balsillie, one of the participants in the hunt, played at Research in Motion, the makers of the BlackBerry smartphone. He is a former co-chief executive of the company, not one of its founders. STYLES An article last Sunday about Maureen Chiquet, a former executive with Chanel, misspelled the surname of an artist whose work decorates Ms. Chiquet\u2019s home. She is Alice Neel, not Neal. SUNDAY BUSINESS An article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly last Sunday about the growth in inflows to the index fund giant Vanguard misspelled the given name of the executive who oversees its retail investor group. She is Karin A. Risi, not Karen. (The error was repeated in a picture caption.) \u2022 An article last Sunday about financial abuse of older people referred incorrectly to systems for complaints and intervention in suspected cases. Though the federal government has no such system, each state has its own; it is not the case that there is no government-run system.
