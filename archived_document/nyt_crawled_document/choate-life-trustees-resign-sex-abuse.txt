{"text": "Two former headmasters who were life trustees at Choate Rosemary Hall stepped down this week, forced aside by allegations that teachers at the school had sexually abused students for decades and that administrators had not responded appropriately. The two trustees were Charles Dey, who served as headmaster at the elite Connecticut boarding school from 1973 to 1991, and Edward Shanahan, who held that position from 1991 to 2011. Choate released a report this month from investigators at the law firm Covington & Burling that named 12 former faculty members who it said had abused students in cases dating back to the 1960s. One teacher was said to have raped a student while on a school trip in Costa Rica. Another used a girl\u2019s disciplinary issues to pressure her to have sex with him repeatedly, the report said. For many years, administrators at the school largely responded to reports of misconduct by trying to keep them quiet. In some cases, administrators decided that accused faculty members could remain at Choate. Other teachers were forced out, but none of the episodes were reported to the authorities until 2010, even though Connecticut educators have been legally required to report suspected abuse since 1967. Because the accusations were never reported, teachers suspected of misconduct were able to move on to work at other schools. Much of the abuse documented by investigators occurred while Mr. Dey and Mr. Shanahan were in charge, and many alumni have called for their removal from their positions. Mr. Dey resigned on Thursday and Mr. Shanahan resigned on Friday. In a statement, Lorraine S. Connelly, a Choate spokeswoman, thanked Mr. Shanahan and Mr. Dey \u201cfor their contributions to the school\u201d and said, \u201cwe believe their resignations are important steps in our community\u2019s healing process.\u201d The news of their resignations was first reported by The Record-Journal in Connecticut. The report released by Choate, which documented misconduct claims in detail, marked a sharp departure from the way the school had handled such issues in the past. Reached by phone, Mr. Dey said he was \"proud of the school, in terms of what they have done and the way they have approached it.\u201d In a lengthy statement, his first since the Choate report was released, Mr. Shanahan said Friday that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d to read about what some students had experienced at the school while he was its headmaster. \u201cThe burden I personally carry is that children were harmed by faculty during my tenure, for which I am deeply, deeply sorry, and the only consolation I have is that, as a result of this report, future incidents like these will be far less likely to occur, and survivors will feel more enabled to come forward for the support they deserve,\u201d Mr. Shanahan said. \u201cThank you for the privilege of serving you for 20 years. Would that I had done it better.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/choate-life-trustees-resign-sex-abuse.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T21:58:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T21:49:45-04:00", "abstract": "The former headmasters left their emeritus positions after a report detailed allegations that teachers at the elite Connecticut boarding school had abused students.", "title": "2 Choate Life Trustees Resign Amid Sexual Abuse Investigation"}
