{"text": "U.S.A. Hockey named Pat Kelleher its next executive director on Thursday, replacing Dave Ogrean as the leader of the sport\u2019s national governing body. Kelleher, currently the assistant executive director for development at U.S.A. Hockey and the U.S.A. Hockey Foundation, guided its youth programs over the past decade, according to a statement on his selection by U.S.A. Hockey. In March, the organization came under scrutiny when the United States women\u2019s national team staged a boycott for an increase in support for female players, particularly at the youth level. Two of the nine members of the search committee that hired Kelleher were women. The boycott shed a light on a lack of diversity within U.S.A. Hockey. It is the only national governing body among American Winter Olympic sports in which women account for less than 20 percent of the board of directors, a threshold encouraged by the International Olympic Committee. U.S.A. Hockey has never had a female executive director. \u201cHe brings a vast knowledge of U.S.A. Hockey and the overall hockey landscape and is well connected at all levels of the game,\u201d Jim Smith, U.S.A. Hockey\u2019s president, said in the statement. \u201cPat\u2019s done an excellent job in leading our growth initiatives and also been at the forefront of our efforts to raise additional resources through the U.S.A. Hockey Foundation.\u201d The women\u2019s national team reached an agreement with U.S.A. Hockey days before the world championship tournament began on March 31, at U.S.A. Hockey\u2019s new training facility in Plymouth, Mich. The team went on to win its fourth straight world title. This year, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s under-18 national teams and men\u2019s junior national team have also won world championships. Kelleher is credited with increasing the number of players ages 8 and younger by almost 20 percent over the past eight seasons. \u201cPat\u2019s passion for hockey and his background and knowledge of U.S.A. Hockey and the sport overall was readily evident,\u201d said Shelley Looney, a two-time Olympian and one of the female members of the search committee. Kelleher will take over as executive director on June 10.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/sports/hockey/usa-hockey-executive-director-pat-kelleher.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T17:26:40-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T17:26:40-04:00", "abstract": "Pat Kelleher has developed youth programs for the sport\u2019s national governing body, which last month faced a boycott by the national women\u2019s team.", "title": "U.S.A.
