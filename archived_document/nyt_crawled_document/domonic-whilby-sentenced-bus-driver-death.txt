{"text": "A Georgia man who crashed a stolen truck into a New York City bus after a night of drinking and killed the driver was sentenced on Tuesday to serve at least eight years and four months in prison, as a state judge rejected his plea for leniency and imposed the maximum penalty. The defendant, Domonic Whilby, 25, remained composed and calm, his eyes steady on Justice Gregory Carro as the judge handed down the sentence of 8\u2153 to 25 years for causing the fatal accident in February 2014. State Supreme Court in Manhattan was packed with members of the transit workers\u2019 union and relatives of the driver, William Pena. Some wept bitterly as they spoke of the loss of a loving man and urged the judge to take a hard line. \u201cClearly you made a series of extremely poor choices,\u201d Justice Carro told Mr. Whilby. The defendant\u2019s decisions appeared to be fueled not only by alcohol, the judge said, but also by unbridled anger. \u201cAlcohol and anger,\u201d he said. \u201cThat mixture never ends well. Never.\u201d In March, a jury found Mr. Whilby, a forklift operator from Griffin, Ga., guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide, second-degree manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter and reckless endangerment after a trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The jury acquitted him of the top charge of second-degree murder. The case turned largely on whether Mr. Whilby was too drunk to understand his actions or to form the intent in his mind necessary to commit a crime. Mr. Whilby had gotten drunk on Feb. 11, 2014, while in the city visiting his uncle, the model Tyson Beckford. The two men attended a fashion show and went to a birthday party for Mr. Beckford\u2019s girlfriend at an upscale restaurant. They ended the night at 1 Oak, a Chelsea club favored by athletes and celebrities. Mr. Whilby told detectives that he consumed six to eight vodka tonics during the night. The last thing he remembered was leaving a nightclub to get some air and being prevented from re-entering by bouncers, his lawyer said. Witnesses, however, said that Mr. Whilby was ejected from the club without his jacket after knocking over a table. For the next two hours, he wandered the surrounding streets in frigid weather. He went into two hotels, falling asleep in the hallway of one of them, and tried to climb into an off-duty taxi. He also sought shelter in an apartment building, according to witnesses and surveillance cameras. Then, at 5:22 a.m. on Feb. 12, Mr. Whilby stole an 18,000-pound commercial truck from a hotel loading dock, running into a car and a truck as he barreled out onto the street. A few minutes later, he ran a red light at 14th Street and Seventh Avenue and slammed into a crosstown bus being driven by Mr. Pena, 49, a 17-year veteran of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Mr. Pena was thrown through the windshield and killed. Mr. Whilby also injured a man on a motor scooter, a coffee vendor, a passer-by and a passenger on the bus. On Tuesday, Mr. Whilby\u2019s lawyer, Laura M. Miranda, urged the judge to be lenient, portraying Mr. Whilby as a recovering alcoholic who had drunk to drown depression and anxiety. She said he had blacked out and was too inebriated to make conscious decisions. But the lead prosecutor, Randolph Clarke Jr., said Mr. Whilby had acted with clear goals in mind and ignored the risks to other people, hitting other cars and a scooter before colliding with the city bus. \u201cHe is not a brooding, tortured soul but a party machine who took a truck and turned it into an instrument of death,\u201d Mr. Clarke said. \u201cHe refused to be denied, deterred or stopped by anyone or anything.\u201d Just before sentencing, Mr. Whilby, who has already been in jail for three years, apologized to the Pena family and said he prayed for their pain to be eased. \u201cNever once did I say it\u2019s not my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cI always knew that there must be consequences for my actions.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/nyregion/domonic-whilby-sentenced-bus-driver-death.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T21:01:45-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T20:53:02-04:00", "abstract": "Domonic Whilby could serve up to 25 years in prison for stealing a truck and causing the death of William Pena after a night of drinking in Manhattan in 2014.", "title": "Man Gets Top Sentence for Killing Bus Driver in Alcohol-Fueled Crash"}
