{"text": "\u201cCatastrophe\u201d returns for a third season in the delightfully smutty marriage between the alter egos of Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney. And \u201cDear White People\u201d brings Justin Simien\u2019s film about race relations in academia to television \u2014 and survives. CATASTROPHE on Amazon. Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney pick up exactly where they left off \u2014 with a receipt for a Plan B pill and a guilty conscience \u2014 in Season 3 of this deliriously filthy comedy about conscious coupling, to which secret drinking, employment malaise and a burst housing bubble have been added. \u201cWe wanted to make their life hard, not just for the fun of watching people having to deal with that but also because that feels, like, reflective of what\u2019s happening in the world at the moment,\u201d Ms. Horgan said in a New York Times interview. \u201cThings are getting tougher, and people are having to dig deep.\u201d The series also brings back Carrie Fisher, who died in December, for a last dance as Rob\u2019s mommy dearest. \u201cGod, she knew how to deliver a line,\u201d Ms. Horgan added. DEAR WHITE PEOPLE on Netflix. Justin Simien\u2019s potent 2014 comedy about race relations on an Ivy League-ish campus is turned into a series and \u201csurvives the transition from film intact and in some ways better,\u201d James Poniewozik wrote in The Times. Logan Browning plays Samantha, a biracial radio host who dresses down white students as a way of parsing her identity. Also on the roster: Troy (Brandon P Bell), a dean\u2019s son; Lionel (DeRon Horton), a gay intellectual; and Coco (Antoinette Robertson), a scholarship student who finds Samantha oblivious to the privilege of her lighter skin. And each occasionally stares directly into the camera. \u201cThe device underlines the show\u2019s mission: to intrude on your safe space, to demand engagement, to make clear that, yes \u2014 whoever you are \u2014 \u2018Dear White People\u2019 is talking to you,\u201d Mr. Poniewozik added.
