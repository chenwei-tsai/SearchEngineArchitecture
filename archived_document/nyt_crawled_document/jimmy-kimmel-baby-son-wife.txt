{"text": "Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d was off the air last week. What fans didn\u2019t know was why. Mr. Kimmel revealed on Monday\u2019s show that his wife had given birth to a son, who, within hours of delivery, was found to have severe heart defects. He needed emergency surgery, leading to a torturous series of events \u2014 then, ultimately, a happy ending. Mr. Kimmel shared the experience in an emotional opening monologue. \u201cWe had atheists praying for us, O.K.?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hate to say it \u2014 even that son of a [expletive] Matt Damon sent flowers.\u201d Mr. Kimmel eventually turned toward politics, decrying the idea that anyone should be denied access to health insurance. \u201cIf your baby is going to die, and it doesn\u2019t have to, it shouldn\u2019t matter how much money you make,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that, whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t football,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no teams. We are the team, it\u2019s the United States. Don\u2019t let their partisan squabbles divide us on something every decent person wants.\u201d Congress agreed to a budget deal over the weekend. Trevor Noah noted on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d that after much back-and-forth on the issue, the agreement didn\u2019t include funding for President Trump\u2019s border wall. Conan O\u2019Brien is a little bothered by the foreign leaders Mr. Trump has chosen to praise lately. Did romance just bloom during a Nigel Farage video clip? A history of the Civil War, starring Andrew Jackson. The endlessly hilarious Amy Schumer will talk to Stephen Colbert on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on Tuesday. She\u2019ll probably discuss her new film, \u201cSnatched,\u201d which also features Goldie Hawn. Michael Moore will soon have his own Broadway show. Its goal? \u201cTo bring down a sitting president.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/television/jimmy-kimmel-baby-son-wife.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T05:24:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T05:18:52-04:00", "abstract": "The host of \u201cLive!\u201d revealed that he was off last week because his wife had given birth to a son.
