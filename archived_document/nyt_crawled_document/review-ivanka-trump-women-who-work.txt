{"text": "WOMEN WHO WORKRewriting the Rules for SuccessBy Ivanka Trump243 pages. Portfolio/Penguin. $26. The preface of Ivanka Trump\u2019s new book, \u201cWomen Who Work,\u201d is anodyne enough. But something about the third paragraph stuck deep in my craw. I didn\u2019t see it coming, at first. \u201cOver the last year and a half,\u201d it begins, \u201cI\u2019ve had the honor of traveling across our country, meeting the men and women of our great nation and listening to their hopes and dreams, their challenges and concerns.\u201d So far, so bueno. It\u2019s the next sentence that\u2019s the real lulu. After so many months of sustained exposure to the anxieties of average Americans, you\u2019d think Trump would have been humbled. Her response was slightly different. \u201cI have grown tremendously as a person,\u201d she continues, \u201cand the experience has been life changing.\u201d For Donald J. Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, the campaign trail was simply a switchback in the long, golden path toward self-actualization. Self-actualization is the all-consuming preoccupation of \u201cWomen Who Work.\u201d In this way, the book is not really offensive so much as witlessly derivative, endlessly recapitulating the wisdom of other, canonical self-help and business books \u2014 by Stephen Covey, Simon Sinek, Shawn Achor, Adam Grant. (Profiting handsomely off the hard work of others appears to be a signature Trumpian trait.) For a while, it reads like the best valedictorian speech ever. Pursue your passion! Make sure you, and not others, define success! Architect a life you love in order to fully realize your multidimensional self! And because Ivanka alone can fix our problems, she opens her book with a pasture full of straw men, including the argument that our culture isn\u2019t having nuanced conversations about working mothers. \u201cThe time to change the narrative around women and work once and for all is long overdue,\u201d Trump writes. This will come as a shock to Sheryl Sandberg and Anne-Marie Slaughter \u2014 both of whom Trump later quotes at length. Eventually, though, a pair of related existential questions emerge. Namely: For whom is Ivanka Trump writing? And what did she write \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d for? As Sinek likes to ask, what is the why of this book? Just looking at \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d gives you a clue. It\u2019s a strawberry milkshake of inspirational quotes. Lee Iacocca appears two pages before Socrates. Toni Morrison appears one page after Est\u00e9e Lauder. A quote from Nelson Mandela introduces the section that encourages women to ask for flextime: \u201cIt always seems impossible until it\u2019s done.\u201d The book is manifestly the descendant of many TED talks and lifestyle websites. (\u201cWomen Who Work\u201d was, in fact, the name of an initiative Trump started on her website, providing advice to working-girl millennials, before it became the title of this book.) It\u2019s perfect for a generation weaned on Pinterest and goop.com \u2014 you can easily imagine its many pink-tinted pages appearing on Shoshanna\u2019s manifestation board in \u201cGirls.\u201d In a crowded marketplace of freelance thought leaders and spiritualists, Trump, with her social-media following of millions, is carving her own niche as a glambition guru, with an explicit aim to \u201cinspire and empower women to create the lives they want to live.\u201d This is the sort of feminism that drives some women bananas, having less to do with structural change than individual fulfillment and accessorizing properly; perhaps it can even be achieved by wearing her fine jewelry or apparel, which she repeatedly mentions throughout the book (as well as her family\u2019s tremendous hotels). There\u2019s certainly a market for it. There\u2019s also family precedent for it. Her father nearly annihilated his millions, and went on to write many successful business books. Why not Ivanka? Better yet, these personal-best and attagirl bromides offer the advantage of being apolitical, and Trump is nothing if not practiced in the art of generic, apolitical speech \u2014 a fact that John Oliver has shrewdly observed. So the why of her book becomes easy to discern. She\u2019s extending the Trump brand. The intended audience for \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d is a more mysterious question. Trump starts out presuming a wide range of female readers. But a class bias at some point begins to reveal itself, and it\u2019s not just in the business leaders she profiles \u2014 who, like Trump, are often the daughters of New York City\u2019s elite. It\u2019s in her discussion of Covey\u2019s four-quadrant time-management grid, when she identifies grocery shopping as neither urgent nor important. (Do the groceries just magically appear in her fridge? Oh, wait. They probably do.) It\u2019s in her confession that \u201chonestly, I wasn\u2019t treating myself to a massage or making much time for self-care\u201d during the 2016 campaign. (Too busy.) It\u2019s in her description of her daily life, in which she somehow \u2014 until the election, anyway \u2014 managed to run her own company, serve as an executive vice president in the Trump Organization, train for a half marathon and spend time alone with each of her three children. Absent locating a wormhole in space, there\u2019s really only one way to find time for all of these commitments, and that is with the help of staff. Yet her household help barely rates a mention in this discussion. By the time Trump gets to her primer on maternity leave, she is, consciously or not, addressing an imaginary cohort of upper management and C.E.O.s. Back at work, she expects you to have a team. It is amazing how many times \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d talks about the importance of Your Team. There are more teams in this book than there are in the N.F.L. In the case of maternity leave, she advises \u201cto be present with your little one, and not wondering whether or not your team is floundering without you.\u201d She adds that you should \u201cFind someone trustworthy and capable on your team to act as a gatekeeper once you go on leave.\u201d That way, they\u2019ll bother you only when it\u2019s truly important. But here\u2019s what really matters about parental leave, as far as Ivanka Trump is concerned: She seems to still believe \u2014 as she did during the presidential campaign \u2014 that Americans ought to be paid for it. She waits until the penultimate page of her book to say so. But she does. (She talks about affordable child care, too.) These final pages were written before Nov. 8, 2016. (Trump says in the preface that she turned in her manuscript before she knew the election results.) And what\u2019s remarkable is that she wrote them as if she thought her old man was going to lose: \u201cWe need to fight for change, whether through the legislature or in the workplace.\u201d Well, her father didn\u2019t lose. Ivanka Trump now has a formal White House role, as a special adviser to the president. She has security clearance and an office in the West Wing. She has access to the ultimate C-suite. At any moment, she could walk in and demand her father put forward a plan that mirrors precisely what she provides her own employees: Eight weeks of paid maternity leave. By European standards, that may be paltry. By American ones, it\u2019s extremely generous and a very big deal. While she\u2019s at it, she might want to show him the part of her book about how the best leaders identify the gaps in their knowledge. But that, I\u2019m guessing, may be far too much to ask.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/books/review-ivanka-trump-women-who-work.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T00:08:25-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-05-02T00:02:05-04:00", "abstract": "In \u201cWomen Who Work,\u201d Ivanka Trump offers advice to inspire you and \u201cyour team.\u201d", "title": "Having Trouble Having It All?
