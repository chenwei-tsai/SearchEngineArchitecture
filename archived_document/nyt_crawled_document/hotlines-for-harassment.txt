{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cAnonymous Harassment Hotlines Are Hard to Find and Harder to Trust\u201d (Business Day, April 22): As someone who has spent 25 years advising companies on how to run ethical, transparent workplaces, I take issue with your claim that whistle-blower hotlines are \u201chard to find and harder to trust.\u201d Employees deserve a trustworthy avenue for reporting wrongdoing. But it doesn\u2019t stop with a hotline. The next vital step is putting processes in place \u2014 especially training \u2014 to encourage reporting, protect reporting employees and properly investigate their reports. The Labor Department recently encouraged both vehicles in its \u201cRecommended Practices for Anti-Retaliation Programs.\u201d Shortcutting either of these steps is a recipe for the kind of corporate scandals you cite. You present notorious anecdotes as evidence that hotlines are frequently ignored or used to retaliate against whistle-blowers. In fact, according to a recent survey by Navex Global (with which I collaborate on training and education programs on ethics and compliance issues), the rate of hotline reporting increased 8 percent last year, and company resolution of whistle-blower reports dropped by four days, from 46 to 42.
