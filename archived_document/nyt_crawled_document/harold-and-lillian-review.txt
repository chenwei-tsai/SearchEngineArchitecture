{"text": "Harold and Lillian Michelson\u2019s names may not sound familiar, but you\u2019ve most likely seen their work in \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cThe Birds,\u201d among many other films. Harold, the storyboard artist husband, and Lillian, the film researcher wife, were a prolific team whose careers are being profiled in Daniel Raim\u2019s documentary \u201cHarold and Lillian: A Hollywood Love Story.\u201d Through charming animated sketches and interviews with the couple and some of their friends, like Mel Brooks, Francis Ford Coppola and Danny DeVito, the documentary reflects on the couple\u2019s work together \u2014 often with Mrs. Michelson\u2019s findings inspiring her husband\u2019s art. Mr. Michelson, who died in 2007, climbed the industry ladder as a storyboard artist, eventually becoming an art director and production designer. Not wanting to stay at home, Mrs. Michelson volunteered at a studio library and became a sought-after film researcher. Their behind-the-scenes influence on filmmakers was far-reaching. Mr. Michelson\u2019s storyboards show sketched versions of memorable scenes, like the parting of the Red Sea in \u201cThe Ten Commandments\u201d and Anne Bancroft\u2019s raised leg overshadowing Dustin Hoffman in \u201cThe Graduate.\u201d Mrs. Michelson excitedly recalls interviewing women at Canter\u2019s Deli in Los Angeles about traditional costumes for \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d and questioning a drug kingpin for \u201cScarface.\u201d The stories are told out of order to make room for personal tangents, including the challenges of raising an autistic son in the 1960s. Like flipping through misplaced leaves in a photo book, the documentary maintains a free-flowing tone as it uncovers the work that went into creating some of the indelible scenes in Hollywood history.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/harold-and-lillian-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:29:45-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:29:45-04:00", "abstract": "Meet the husband-and-wife team that inspired some of the most memorable moments onscreen, from \u201cThe Graduate\u201d to \u201cThe Birds.\u201d", "title": "Review: \u2018Harold and Lillian\u2019 Introduces a Hollywood Power Couple"}
