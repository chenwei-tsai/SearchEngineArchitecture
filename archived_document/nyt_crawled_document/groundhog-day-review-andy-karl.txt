{"source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-17T22:02:45-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "text": "Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it\u2019s practiced by Andy Karl in \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d the dizzyingly witty new musical from the creators of \u201cMatilda.\u201d Portraying a man doomed to relive a single day over and over and over again in a small town that becomes his custom-fitted purgatory, Mr. Karl is so outrageously inventive in ringing changes on the same old, same old, that you can\u2019t wait for another (almost identical) day to dawn. That might also be said of the bounteous surrounding production that opened on Monday night at the August Wilson Theater, which features songs by Tim Minchin and is directed by Matthew Warchus (collaborators on \u201cMatilda\u201d), with a book by Danny Rubin. Based on Harold Ramis\u2019s 1993 movie, \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d reimagines a much-loved film about instant karma with such fertile and feverish theatrical imagination that you expect to it implode before your eyes. Perhaps that accounts for the gremlins that have plagued this show in its previews. Mr. Karl injured his knee near the end of Friday night\u2019s performance and finished the show with a walking stick. (His opening-night costume was to include a knee brace.) And during the critics\u2019 preview I attended on Thursday, a technical glitch stopped the show in the first act \u2014 during a car chase number, if you please, of particularly intricate mayhem. It sort of made sense. How many blazingly bright ideas can a single musical contain before it sets fire to itself? The 10-minute delay was a bummer, and I wondered if this cartoon-colored production, designed as a whirling wonderland by Rob Howell, would regain its momentum. But then, hallelujah, the curtain rose again, and there was Mr. Karl, back in the driver\u2019s seat (literally). And when he crossed himself, Roman Catholic-style, before beginning again the song we\u2019d just heard \u2014 a drunken country-western rouser called \u201cNobody Cares\u201d \u2014 he had us back in the palms of his never-idle hands. He had evidently taken to heart the show\u2019s lesson that improvisation is the mother of redemption, a tenet surely to be tested by his injury. Such infectious quick thinking was also the hallmark of the leading man of the original film, which was written by Mr. Rubin and Mr. Ramis. I mean, of course, Bill Murray, a comedy star with a peerless gift for leavening snark with a pinch of sentimentality. You would think that in any adaptation of the movie, the biggest shadow would be cast not by its weather-predicting title critter but by Mr. Murray. Yet while you\u2019re in the presence of Mr. Karl, which, thankfully, is for most of the show, he unconditionally owns the role of Phil Connors. Phil is a burned-out TV weatherman who winds up, through a bolt of metaphysical magic, being forced to relive the same day in the snug little town of Punxsutawney, Pa. (That\u2019s the home of the celebrity groundhog, also named Phil, whose Feb. 2 sighting, or not, of his shadow is said to foretell the duration of the winter.) In translating this story to the stage, this production plies the bold but risky idea of making entrapment in a hick burg feel like being caught in an all-too-chipper song-and-dance show, the kind of musical that makes people allergic to musicals. The citizens of Punxsutawney are first discovered prancing and crooning in ways you might at first mistake for a parody of the sentimental earnestness of another of this season\u2019s arrivals, \u201cCome From Away.\u201d Think of it: Perky, folksy people singing, forever and ever, about the pride of belonging to \u201ca little town with a heart as big as any town\u201d on an endlessly rotating stage. And you thought the characters in Sartre\u2019s \u201cNo Exit\u201d had it bad. But this show, like the movie that inspired it, is to Groundhog Day what \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d are to Christmas. And during the production\u2019s two and a half very full hours, Phil gradually trades in his cynicism for a grateful acceptance of life\u2019s simpler pleasures. These, of course, include the love of a good woman, who, in this case, is a morally grounded young television producer named Rita Hanson, charmingly embodied and sung by Barrett Doss, who provides ballast without being boring. It\u2019s Phil\u2019s journey more than his destination that makes \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d such joy, as Mr. Karl \u2014 previously seen as the punch-drunk title contendah of the \u201cRocky\u201d musical \u2014 gives many-splendored life to each faltering on the road to self-discovery. Anger, prickliness, outrage, wonder, godlike omnipotence, drunken what-the-hell exhilaration, suicidal angst, Zen-like resignation \u2014 Mr. Karl turns these different feelings into a replete gallery of self-portraits, drawn with both comic panache and genuine feeling. He uses every tool in the musical arsenal, too, often to devastating effect. Even his antic dancing traces a precise evolution of character. (Peter Darling, of \u201cBilly Elliot\u201d fame, did the choreography, with Ellen Kane.) And his pliable baritone covers the waterfront of emotions, from sardonic, pattering blitheness (\u201cSmall Town, USA\u201d) to heavy-metal despair (the paradoxically titled \u201cHope\u201d). The insanely talented Mr. Minchin writes songs in many shades, though he\u2019s probably most at home where shadows lurk. As in \u201cMatilda,\u201d his undulating melodies and whip-smart lyrics tap into the brooding sides of the supporting characters, extending the reach of existential anxiety beyond Phil\u2019s solipsism. There are unexpectedly poignant solos for supporting characters, like the town beauty (Rebecca Faulkenberry) and a bereaved insurance salesman (John Sanders). And the riotous \u201cNobody Cares,\u201d in which Phil goes driving drunk with a couple of barflies (Andrew Call and Raymond J. Lee, both hilarious), becomes an ingeniously staged exercise in hedonistic hopelessness. (Let\u2019s pray that glitch is fixed permanently.) Will Broadway audiences be willing to follow \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d into its darkest corners? (A repeated suicide sequence is a demonic doozy.) The bigger problem for many might be the plenitude of styles in which the movie traffics. The show is tighter and more consistent than when I saw it at the Old Vic in London (where the show and Mr. Karl picked up Olivier Awards). But it could still shed a number or two, including a long sequence in which Phil consults various fraudulent doctors. But Mr. Karl is a very persuasive guide to the show\u2019s mercurial moods. And as he maps out the many phases of Phil, New York audiences have the rare chance to witness the full emergence of a newborn, bona fide musical star. Thanks to his character\u2019s successive reincarnations, Mr. Karl is giving not one but many of the best performances of the season.", "abstract": "A beloved movie is adapted to the musical stage with feverish imagination \u2014 and a magnetic Andy Karl shooing away the shadow of Bill Murray.", "section": "Theater", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/theater/groundhog-day-review-andy-karl.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Review: A Star Is Born (and Born and Born) in \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T21:03:20-04:00"}
