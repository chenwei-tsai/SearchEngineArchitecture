{"text": "BETHPAGE, N.Y. \u2014 New York City Firefighter William N. Tolley lived to the sound of a rumble: the roar of his tower ladder rig and the growls of death metal, twin passions born in his teenage years and miraculously forged into night-and-day careers. Outside his funeral at St. Martin of Tours Church here on Thursday, several thousand firefighters listened once more: to the whine of bagpipes, the rattle of snare drums and the thrashing of helicopters in formation, but also to the silence, when the death of a fastidious fire partner and a doting father was felt by row after row of men and women in blue. \u201cHe was a hard-core rocker and also a firefighter with a baby seat in the back of his minivan,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said in his eulogy, quoting a friend\u2019s description of Mr. Tolley. \u201cTalk about range.\u201d Mr. Tolley, 42, died after falling from the roof of a five-story building in Ridgewood, Queens, last Thursday.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/new-york-firefighters-say-a-final-goodbye-to-a-brother-in-blue.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T17:05:59-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T17:05:59-04:00", "abstract": "\u201cHe was a hard-core rocker and also a firefighter with a baby seat in the back of his minivan,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said of William N.
