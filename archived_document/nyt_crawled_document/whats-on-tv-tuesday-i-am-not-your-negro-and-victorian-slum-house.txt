Communing posthumously with the writer James Baldwin \u2014 and drawing on a book about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that he began sketching out in the mid-1970s but never completed \u2014 the director Raoul Peck creates \u201ca thrilling introduction\u201d to Baldwin\u2019s work, \u201ca remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics,\u201d A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. With the heft of a 10-hour mini-series or a literary doorstop, this Oscar nominee for best documentary feature \u2014 narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, speaking words taken entirely from Baldwin\u2019s pages \u2014 is \u201clife-altering,\u201d Mr. Scott added. Though Baldwin has been dead for nearly 30 years, \u201cyou would be hard-pressed to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force, insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history.\u201d VICTORIAN SLUM HOUSE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings).
