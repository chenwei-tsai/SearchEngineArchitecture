{"text": "KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON The Osage Murders and the Birth of the F.B.I. By David Grann 338 pp. Doubleday. $28.95. In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson hosted a delegation of Osage chiefs who had traveled from their ancestral land, which Jefferson had recently acquired \u2014 from the French, not the Osage \u2014 in the Louisiana Purchase. The Osage representatives were tall, many of them over six feet, and they towered over most of their White House hosts. Jefferson was impressed, calling them the \u201c finest men we have ever seen.\u201d He promised to treat their tribe fairly, telling them that from then on, \u201cthey shall know our nation only as friends and benefactors.\u201d Over the next 20 years, the Osage were stripped of their land, ceding almost 100 million acres, and were forced onto a parcel in southeastern Kansas that measured about 50 by 125 miles (four million acres). This land would be theirs forever, the United States government told them. And then \u2014 as David Grann details early in his disturbing and riveting new book, \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d \u2014 this promise, too, was broken. White settlers began squatting on Osage territory, skirmishes ensued and eventually the tribe had to sell the land for $1.25 an acre. Looking for a new home, the Osage found an area of what was to become Oklahoma that no one else wanted. It was hilly and unsuited to cultivation. The Osage bought the parcel for roughly a million dollars, later adding a provision that the land\u2019s \u201coil, gas, coal or other minerals\u201d would be owned by the Osage, too. Thus they owned the land above and whatever was below, as well. No one argued the point at the time. No one but the Osage knew there was oil under that rocky soil. The Osage leased the land to prospectors and made a fortune. \u201cIn 1923 alone,\u201d Grann writes, \u201cthe tribe took in more than $30 million, the equivalent today of more than $400 million. The Osage were considered the wealthiest people per capita in the world.\u201d They built mansions and bought fleets of cars. A magazine writer at the time wrote: \u201cEvery time a new well is drilled the Indians are that much richer. \u2026 The Osage Indians are becoming so rich that something will have to be done about it.\u201d Indeed. The federal government, ostensibly concerned about the Osage Indians\u2019 ability to manage their windfall, required many Osage Indians \u2014 those it classified as \u201cincompetent\u201d \u2014 to have a guardian oversee the management and spending of their money. Full-blooded Indians could expect to be deemed \u201cincompetent\u201d and in need of oversight, whereas those of mixed blood were allowed to manage their own affairs. Not surprisingly, the Osage became popular targets for theft, graft and mercenary marriage. A white woman sent a letter to the tribe, offering herself to any willing Osage bachelor: \u201cWill you please tell the richest Indian you know of, and he will find me as good and true as any human being can be.\u201d Grann approaches his narrative by way of Mollie Burkhart, a full member of the Osage tribe and one of four sisters who all became wealthy and married white men. But despite their windfall, their lives were fraught and ended too soon. Her sister Minnie died at 27 of what doctors ruled a \u201cpeculiar wasting illness.\u201d A few years later, her sister Anna, who was known to enjoy whiskey and late nights in speakeasies, left one evening and never came home. Her body was found a week later in a ravine. She had been shot in the head. Another Osage member, Charles Whitehorn, was found shot within days of the discovery of Anna\u2019s body. Both he and Anna had been killed with small-caliber bullets. \u201cTwo Separate Murder Cases Are Unearthed Almost at Same Time,\u201d a newspaper headline declared. Two months after Anna\u2019s body was found, her mother, Lizzie, also died of the same vague wasting \u201cdisease\u201d that had claimed Minnie. When another sister turned up dead in a suspicious fire, leaving Mollie as the last of her family alive, she was terrified. Someone or something was killing not just the members of her family but Osage Indians en masse \u2014 hence the first half of Grann\u2019s subtitle, \u201cThe Osage Murders and the Birth of the F.B.I.\u201d Nine months after the deaths of Anna Brown and Charles Whitehorn, a champion Osage steer roper named William Stepson died of an apparent poisoning. Two more Osage died in the ensuing months, both of suspected poisonings. A couple was blown up by a nitroglycerin bomb while they slept in their bed. The killing continued, with more than two dozen people \u2014 not just Osage Indians but also white investigators sent to look into the crimes \u2014 killed between 1920 and 1924. It became known as the Osage Reign of Terror. The second part of Grann\u2019s subtitle nods to the fitful investigation into the killings and their role in shaping the modern F.B.I. In the 1920s, law enforcement was typically conducted by a patchwork of sheriffs, private detectives and vigilantes. The sheriff of Osage County at the time was Harve M. Freas, 58, who weighed 300 pounds and was rumored to cavort with bootleggers and gamblers. He had done nothing to determine who was killing the Osage Indians, so the tribe asked Barney McBride, a white oilman they trusted, to go to Washington, D.C., to insist the federal government intervene. A day after he arrived, McBride\u2019s body was found in a Maryland culvert. He was naked and had been stabbed over 20 times. \u201cConspiracy Believed to Kill Rich Indians,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s headline read. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was created by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, to fill in gaps in jurisdiction and assist where local enforcement was overmatched. By the 1920s, though, it was still relatively small, with only a few hundred agents and a handful of offices around the country. Most important, the bureau\u2019s agents were not trusted. Known for bending laws and getting cozy with criminals, the Department of Justice, Grann writes, \u201chad become known as the Department of Easy Virtue.\u201d That changed in 1924, when J. Edgar Hoover was appointed the director of the F.B.I. He was not a likely choice. He had been deputy director under Burns, but was only 29 and had never been a detective. He was diminutive, struggled with a stutter and a fear of germs, and lived with his mother. But he was zealous and organized, and had a vision for the bureau. He insisted that all agents have some background in law or accounting; that they wear dark suits and ties; that they abstain from alcohol and be models of personal propriety; and that they use new, scientific methods of sleuthing, including fingerprint identification, ballistics, handwriting analysis and phone-tapping. The Osage murders would be Hoover\u2019s first significant test of the new F.B.I.\u2019s abilities. Given that so many investigators had already failed or had been murdered in pursuit of the killers, Hoover needed the sturdiest and most incorruptible of agents to head up the investigation. He chose Tom White, a Texan myth of a man. White\u2019s father was the local sheriff in Austin, so Tom grew up in a home attached to the county jail. He and two brothers eventually became Texas Rangers. Looking for a more stable life, White became an F.B.I. agent. White was empowered to put his own team together, most of whom would insinuate themselves into Osage undercover. One older agent entered town as an elderly cattle rancher. Another agent, a former insurance salesman, set up a real insurance office in town. And John Wren, part Ute Indian \u2014 one of the F.B.I.\u2019s few Native Americans \u2014 arrived as an Indian medicine man hoping to find his relatives. If this all sounds like the plot of a detective novel, you have fallen under the spell of David Grann\u2019s brilliance. In his previous two books, \u201cThe Lost City of Z,\u201d about the search for the golden Amazonian city of El Dorado, and \u201cThe Devil and Sherlock Holmes,\u201d a varied collection of journalism, Grann has proved himself a master of spinning delicious, many-layered mysteries that also happen to be true. As a reporter he is dogged and exacting, with a singular ability to uncover and incorporate obscure journals, depositions and ledgers without ever letting the plot sag. As a writer he is generous of spirit, willing to give even the most scurrilous of characters the benefit of the doubt. Thus, when Tom White and his men solve the crime, and the mastermind behind the murders is revealed, you will not see it coming. You will feel that familiar thrill at having been successfully misdirected, but then there are about 70 pages left in the book. And in these last pages, Grann takes what was already a fascinating and disciplined recording of a forgotten chapter in American history, and with the help of contemporary Osage tribe members, he illuminates a sickening conspiracy that goes far deeper than those four years of horror. It will sear your soul. Among the towering thefts and crimes visited upon the native peoples of the continent, what was done to the Osage must rank among the most depraved and ignoble. \u201cThis land is saturated with blood,\u201d says Mary Jo Webb, an Osage Indian alive today and still trying to understand the crimes of the past. \u201cHistory,\u201d Grann writes in this shattering book, \u201cis a merciless judge.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/books/review/killers-of-the-flower-moon-david-grann.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T17:29:57-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T17:29:57-04:00", "abstract": "In \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d David Grann uncovers a shattering history of oil greed, racism and serial murder targeting the Osage Indians.", "title": "Solving a Reign of Terror Against Native Americans"}
