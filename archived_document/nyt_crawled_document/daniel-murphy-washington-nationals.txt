The Washington Nationals have gotten the sustained version, a feared cleanup hitter who arrived at Citi Field on Friday to start what should be another season of damage against his former team. \u201cI think Murph just learned himself more,\u201d said Ryan Zimmerman, the Nationals\u2019 veteran first baseman, referring to Murphy\u2019s well-known story of adjusting his approach through sessions with the Mets\u2019 hitting coach, Kevin Long. \u201cThat\u2019s the weird thing about baseball \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s just one little thing and the lightbulb goes on,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cI\u2019ve had seasons where I feel great, and then for a month, it\u2019s like you forgot how to hit. Then you do a drill or make one little adjustment, and you feel like you\u2019ll never get out again. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a frustrating sport.\u201d The Nationals were frustrated again last October, falling in a division series for the third time in five seasons. But April has been blissful. The team sits in first place in the National League East, and Zimmerman, the franchise pillar, is benefiting \u2014 at least to some degree \u2014 from Murphy\u2019s example. After the Mets\u2019 halfhearted effort to retain him with a one-year qualifying offer after the 2015 World Series, Murphy signed a three-year, $37.5 million deal with Washington. He hit .347 last season and led the N.L. in on-base-plus-slugging percentage, at .985, validating his concerted effort to launch more balls into the sky. \u201cWhat\u2019s success?\u201d Murphy asked Friday. \u201cGetting a pitch in your zone and hitting it as hard as humanly possible is success. Just putting the ball in play is not necessarily success.\u201d Zimmerman knows how to hit for power. He has a better career slugging percentage in 13 seasons as a National (.470) than Murphy had in seven seasons as a Met (.424). But Murphy, an expert in the analytics of his craft, studied data last winter that indicated why Zimmerman was not being rewarded for his hard hits. He was hitting far too many ground balls, the numbers showed, and needed to raise his launch angle. Zimmerman has done so, but not drastically. Last year, it was 7.9 degrees; this year, 11.5 degrees \u2014 still well below the Mets\u2019 Yoenis Cespedes, who is among the leaders at 24.5 degrees. But Zimmerman came into this series hitting .389, with five homers and a .778 slugging percentage that ranked fourth in the N.L. Murphy, who was hitting .344 with two homers, has refused to take credit for Zimmerman\u2019s success. It would make a neat story line, but it\u2019s not quite reality. Zimmerman understood what Murphy meant, and he does have a better ground-ball-to-fly-ball ratio now. But he has not tried to remake himself the same way. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the numbers, because they prove a point: Obviously, if you hit the ball hard and you hit the ball in the air, you\u2019re gonna do more damage, and he\u2019s the perfect example of that,\u201d Zimmerman said of Murphy. \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to discount them completely, but I didn\u2019t completely change what I\u2019m doing. I feel like if I can get 500 or 600 at-bats, I still feel confident enough in my abilities that I\u2019ll put up the numbers that I should put up.\u201d Getting those at-bats has been the problem. Zimmerman has spent much of the past three seasons on the disabled list because of a long checklist of problems: a fractured thumb and hamstring strain in 2014, plantar fasciitis and an oblique strain in 2015, and a strained rib cage and a wrist contusion last year. With the injuries and the decline in performance \u2014 he batted just .218, with 15 homers, last season \u2014 it is easy to forget that Zimmerman is still only 32 years old. Manager Dusty Baker said the player\u2019s age, track record and otherwise sound physical condition made him believe in a Zimmerman comeback. \u201cHe\u2019s hitting the ball into right-center field, and that means you\u2019re staying on the ball,\u201d Baker said. \u201cHis pitch selection is better because he doesn\u2019t feel like he has to start his swing earlier, which makes you more susceptible to being tricked. I\u2019m glad for Zim, because he was my pick to click when the year started. He\u2019s a guy we needed very, very badly.\u201d Right fielder Bryce Harper has looked the way he did during his most valuable player season in 2015, and the newcomer Adam Eaton has been shining in center field. With left fielder Jayson Werth looking sturdy, the new catcher Matt Wieters fitting in well and shortstop Trea Turner activated from the disabled list Friday, the Nationals have been baseball\u2019s best offense. They averaged 6.15 runs per game entering the weekend. \u201cHe lengthens out the lineup so much,\u201d Murphy said of Zimmerman. \u201cThe at-bats Ryan\u2019s having right now are just really fun to watch. He\u2019s taking advantage of mistakes on the plate, he\u2019s not swinging at marginal pitches for balls. He\u2019s been really dangerous in there. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some really good conversations, him and I, and everyone on the offensive side of this team is very open to discuss what\u2019s going on, what the pitcher\u2019s trying to do to us. Ryan\u2019s really cerebral \u2014 he\u2019s always got a plan when he gets to the plate. For me, having a plan is always the biggest deal, no matter what.\u201d Murphy\u2019s plan to obliterate baseballs helped plant an N.L. champions flag high above right field in Flushing. Zimmerman\u2019s plan is less overt but with a similar endgame: to be the best version of himself. \u201cI haven\u2019t really done anything crazy different,\u201d he said. \u201cI always felt like if you just continue to hit the ball hard, good things will happen.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T21:22:11-04:00", "abstract": "Murphy, an expert in the analytics of hitting, saw that Ryan Zimmerman was getting too many ground balls after hard hits.
