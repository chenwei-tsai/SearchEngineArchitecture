Here\u2019s a look back at seven of his career-defining films, with review excerpts. This comedy stars Paul Le Mat as a down-on-his-luck man who gives a ride to a bearded stranger (Jason Robards) who turns out to be Howard Hughes. The movie was well received by audiences and critics, including Vincent Canby, who in his review for The New York Times praised Mr. Demme\u2019s efforts: \u201cHe is clearly a social satirist in the tradition of Preston Sturges. He\u2019s a filmmaker with a fondness for the absurdities of our existence and for people who have no idea that they\u2019re \u2018little\u2019 or teetering on the edge of disaster.\u201d Mr. Demme provided a fresh take on the concert film with this Talking Heads performance documentary. With dynamic sound and visual panache, Mr. Demme\u2019s movie drew raves as much for what it didn\u2019t show as for what it did. There\u2019s no backstage band footage or constant shots of screaming fans. In her Times review, Janet Maslin wrote, \u201cMr. Demme has captured both the look and the spirit of this live performance with a daring and precision that match the group\u2019s own.\u201d Part comedy, part adventure, part romance, \u201cSomething Wild\u201d helped to solidify the careers of its leads, Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith. But it was the funny moments that resonated most with Mr. Canby, who wrote: \u201cMr. Demme has a singular gift for offbeat comedy. When \u2018Something Wild\u2019 is dealing with the burgeoning relationship between the once-uptight Charlie and the sweetly desperate, near-alcoholic Audrey, the film has the manner of a screwball comedy designed for the 1980s.\u201d This gangster comedy includes broad, lively takes from Michelle Pfeiffer and Alec Baldwin. The film\u2019s style is in line with \u201cSomething Wild,\u201d but a bit lighter, and Ms. Maslin appreciated that in her review. She wrote: \u201cIn telling a story that hinges on stereotypical Italian gangsters, Mr. Demme conjures up a comic garishness that is really something special. He makes this even funnier by underscoring the aspects of mob-related home life that are, by these standards, utterly mundane.\u201d One of Mr. Demme\u2019s most popular, and quotable, films, this best-picture Oscar winner, about an F.B.I. trainee who interviews the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, also earned Academy Awards for its leads, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. In his review, Mr. Canby complimented Mr. Demme\u2019s deft hand with the dark subject matter: \u201cMr. Demme is a director of both humor and subtlety. The gruesome details are vivid without being exploited. He also handles the big set pieces with skill.\u201d One of the first studio movies to place the AIDS epidemic front and center, this film earned Tom Hanks his first Oscar. Writing about the movie, Ms. Maslin said, \u201cMr. Demme knows how to breathe both hope and frustration into the promise of brotherly love.\u201d In the view of some critics, this drama both revived Mr. Demme\u2019s career and served as a showcase for its lead, Anne Hathaway. The film was made independently and shot on video, on a budget much lower than the studio films Mr. Demme had been making. In his Times review, A. O. Scott wrote: \u201cThe wonderful thing about \u2018Rachel Getting Married\u2019 is how expansive it seems, in spite of the limits of its scope and the modesty of its ambitions. It\u2019s a small movie, and in some ways a very sad one, but it has an undeniable and authentic vitality, an exuberance of spirit, that feels welcome and rare.\u201d", "section": "Movies", "abstract": "A look at some of the filmmaker\u2019s most noteworthy films, from \u201cMelvin and Howard\u201d to \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d and \u201cRachel Getting Married.\u201d", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T15:29:16-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/movies/jonathan-demme-movie-reviews-silence-of-the-lambs.html", "title": "Jonathan Demme: The Director\u2019s Seven Career-Defining Movies"}
