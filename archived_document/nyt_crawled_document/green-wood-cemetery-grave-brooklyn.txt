{"text": "On a recent afternoon a team of gravediggers chucked the final shovelfuls of dirt out of a grave dug into a hilltop at Green-Wood Cemetery. The team then winched a marble gravestone weighing 500 pounds up the hillside, preparing an unusual grave. There will be no funeral, no mourners \u2014 in fact, no body will be inside the plot. Dug deep into a hill in Brooklyn will be a grave of secrets. \u201cHere lie the secrets of the visitors of Green-Wood Cemetery\u201d is etched into the cream marble of the obelisk marking the grave. At its base is a thin slot \u2014 a letter opening where slips of paper bearing secrets are to be slid into an underground chamber and taken, quite literally, to the grave. The grave is the work of Sophie Calle, a French conceptual artist, and was commissioned by Creative Time and co-presented with the cemetery. Creative Time is a public arts organization known for putting on less furtive works, like Duke Riley\u2019s \u201cFly by Night,\u201d last year, in which pigeons outfitted with LED lights took to the night sky over the Brooklyn Navy Yard like flocks of stars, and a recent, politicized haunted house called \u201cDoomocracy\u201d at the Brooklyn Army Terminal. The grave will open officially to the public on Saturday, when Ms. Calle will be on hand throughout the weekend to listen to visitors\u2019 whispered secrets and guide the words on slips of paper by hand into the grave. Ms. Calle has committed to never revealing what she hears. The grave will remain a permanent installation for visitors to put secrets in themselves after this weekend\u2019s event is over. \u201cMy purpose is the poetry, the work of art, but not the therapy,\u201d said Ms. Calle, by phone from Paris, where she lives, a few days after the obelisk was erected. \u201cThere may be a therapeutic effect, but that is not my intent. My intent is art.\u201d Ms. Calle, who recently spoke with The New York Times Magazine while wearing a false pregnant belly from which she planned to give birth to a cat, has used secrets as a substrate for her art before. Her first secrets\u2019 project began with a San Francisco couple who each confessed to her; she locked their confidences into twin safes and only she knows the combinations. The safes are on display in the couple\u2019s dining room. The grave is the most public of what is now a triptych of similar artwork in three graveyards around the world. There is one in Geneva and another in a tiny graveyard in the Brittany region of France \u2014 the only one in which Ms. Calle\u2019s own secrets are interred. For the San Francisco couple, Ms. Calle\u2019s work came with a quirky contract: Should they ever open the safes, the pieces would no longer be a work of art. Ms. Calle has a contract with Green-Wood as well: For the next 25 years, she has committed to returning to incinerate the piled-up secrets whenever the underground vault becomes too full. \u201cWe like this kind of unburdening and this opportunity to be more reflective,\u201d said Katie Hollander, the executive director of Creative Time. The project, she said, offers \u201ca moment of catharsis, getting things that we\u2019re holding onto and releasing them in new ways.\u201d About a week before the opening, Felix Hernandez, 42, a gravedigger at Green-Wood, stood inside the unfinished grave as his cousin and fellow gravedigger, Gustavo Padilla, 37, slid slips of paper through the slot in the headstone, testing the mechanism for delivering secrets to the hereafter. (They are members of a rarefied crew. To become a gravedigger at Green-Wood requires an unusual rite, a 40-day training session culminating in a test: digging an entire grave by hand in under four hours.) \u201cNow I know what you did last summer!\u201d Mr. Hernandez said with a laugh as he caught a piece of paper Mr. Padilla had successfully sent through the chute. Just beside them was Robert LeRoy \u2014 in a manner of speaking. A Civil War captain, his body has lain in the same hill as the new grave of secrets for the last 152 years, according to his headstone. Captain LeRoy is one of 560,000 people buried here since 1838; Green-Wood is a National Historic Landmark, but it is also a working cemetery, where burials continue. Yet in Green-Wood, where ballet dancers have cavorted among the headstones and plays have been put on beside the tombs, no irreverence is intended with the presence of an art installation alongside actual graves and grief. In its Victorian-era heyday, cemeteries were considered a prime place to appreciate statuary, said Art Presson, the superintendent of the grounds. Green-Wood, with its 478 acres filled with carvings of granite and marble, was then one of the top tourist destinations in America. \u201cThe cemetery was conceived originally as an outdoor museum; this is a contemporary take on it,\u201d Mr. Presson said. \u201cIf you wanted to see sculpture in the 19th century, this is where you would come. This doesn\u2019t offend the graves at all.\u201d The obelisk\u2019s cream surface is shot through with pink marbling. It was polished to a high luster from a pockmarked and eroded stone found in a derelict warehouse of headstones just outside the cemetery gates. Now up on the hill, it rests on a cube of seemingly solid marble \u2014 with its own secret. It is in fact a cement box, hollow inside to let the letters of visitors slide through, a feat of trompe l\u2019oeil marbling. Here\u2019s another one: On a recent visit a few days before the opening, this reporter slipped in a secret of her own.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/green-wood-cemetery-grave-brooklyn.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T09:27:18-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T09:24:01-04:00", "abstract": "At this grave site, there will be no funeral, no body and no mourners \u2014 just slips of paper bearing confidences to be buried.", "title": "A Grave of Secrets is Dug in a Brooklyn Cemetery"}
