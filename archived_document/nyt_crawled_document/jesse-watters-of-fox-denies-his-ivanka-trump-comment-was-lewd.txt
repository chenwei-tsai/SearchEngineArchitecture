{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "Jesse Watters, the Bill O\u2019Reilly prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who recently moved to the 9 p.m. slot on Fox News as a host of the \u201cThe Five,\u201d made a comment on Tuesday that critics saw as a lewd joke directed at Ivanka Trump. Responding to footage of Ms. Trump being jeered on stage in Berlin while speaking on a panel about female entrepreneurship, Mr. Watters first defended Ms. Trump, the daughter of President Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, the left says they really respect women, and then when given an opportunity to respect a woman like that, they boo and hiss,\u201d he said. Then he added with a grin: \u201cSo I don\u2019t really get what\u2019s going on here, but I really liked how she was speaking into that microphone.\u201d In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Watters denied any implication that the comment was sexual. \u201cDuring the break we were commenting on Ivanka\u2019s voice and how it was low and steady and resonates like a smooth jazz radio DJ,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis was in no way a joke about anything else.\u201d His critics were unconvinced, believing the comment to be innuendo. The editor of the conservative magazine Commentary, John Podhoretz, who is also a Weekly Standard editor and New York Post columnist, denounced him repeatedly on Twitter. Others joined in. The episode comes at a bad time for Fox News, the cable news giant that has been reeling from claims of sexual misconduct throughout the organization. Mr. O\u2019Reilly, one of the network\u2019s biggest stars, was forced out last week after the revelation that the company had spent $13 million on settlements with five women who accused him of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior. Its former chairman, Roger Ailes, was ousted last year two weeks after several women, including Gretchen Carlson, a former anchor, accused him of sexual harassment. This month, two more women accused Mr. Ailes of harassment: Julie Roginsky, a current contributor, asserted that she faced retaliation for rebuffing Mr. Ailes\u2019 sexual advances, and Alisyn Camerota, a former anchor, accused him of saying \u201cgrossly inappropriate\u201d things to her when she asked for new opportunities at work. When Mr. O\u2019Reilly was dismissed, Mr. Watters was among the hosts tapped to take his 9 p.m. spot with the move of \u201cThe Five,\u201d an afternoon ensemble show, into prime time. Mr. Watters had already been steadily on the rise. In March, for example, he interviewed President Trump. He had appeared before on Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show. A heavily criticized segment in October relied on racial stereotypes of Asians in a series of interviews in New York\u2019s Chinatown neighborhood. Mr. Watters said the October segment was \u201cmeant to be taken as tongue-in-cheek and I regret if anyone found offense.\u201d", "title": "Jesse Watters of Fox Denies His Ivanka Trump Comment Was Lewd", "abstract": "The Bill O\u2019Reilly prot\u00e9g\u00e9, who has been criticized for other broadcasts, finds himself under fire again.", "section": "Business Day", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-26T15:09:32-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/business/media/jesse-watters-of-fox-denies-his-ivanka-trump-comment-was-lewd.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T15:09:32-04:00"}
