Her work has never lost its relevance, but it feels especially pertinent today. Lincoln was living in Harlem in 1962 when she helped to establish the Cultural Association for Women of African Heritage. Her 1966 essay \u201cWho Will Revere the Black Woman?\u201d has been reprinted in various collections over the years. But her music lives the fullest afterlife. Lincoln\u2019s tart drawl earned comparisons to Billie Holiday, but she matched it with a deep, bridling intensity that refused to be displaced. The sharp poetry of her lyrics conveyed only a sliver of her message. From Thursday, May 4 to 7, the Apollo Theater will host a festival of conversations and performances titled \u201cWomen of the World.\u201d It culminates on Saturday, May 6, with a concert celebrating Lincoln\u2019s work. The musical director, Terri Lyne Carrington, has assembled three world-class vocalists to honor Lincoln: Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Esperanza Spalding.
