{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cTrump Officials Brace for Anger at Duterte Call\u201d (front page, May 1): With each day of the Trump presidency, the stature of our country is further diminished. We are no longer the beacon of hope for immigrants; no longer the leader in the battle to mitigate climate change; no longer a country seeking to reduce gun violence; no longer a country trying to lessen income inequity; no longer a country working to preserve our environment. Instead, we are a country whose president, after a \u201cvery friendly conversation,\u201d invites President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, a man responsible for thousands of extrajudicial killings, to the White House. This act makes a mockery of all the United States has stood for. As American citizens, we should be ashamed.
