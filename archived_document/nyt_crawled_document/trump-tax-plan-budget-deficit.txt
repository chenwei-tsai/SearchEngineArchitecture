{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump\u2019s top economic advisers faced a barrage of questions on Wednesday about the tax plan they had just unfurled, there was one that they struggled most to answer: how to keep the \u201cmassive tax cuts\u201d they proposed from ballooning the federal deficit. The White House insists that economic growth will cover the cost, which could be as high as $7 trillion over a decade. But the question will dog Republicans and could fracture their party as they face the prospect of endorsing a plan that many economists and budget analysts warn will increase the deficit. After years of fiscal hawkishness, conservatives now face a moment of truth about whether they truly believe America\u2019s economy is drowning in debt. Some skeptics are already ringing alarm bells, fearing that Republicans will sign on to what critics see as a dangerous plan composed by a president who called himself the King of Debt. \u201cIt seems the administration is using economic growth like magic beans: the cheap solution to all our problems,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that advocates fiscal restraint. \u201cBut there is no golden goose at the top of the tax-cut beanstalk, just mountains of debt.\u201d Ms. MacGuineas\u2019s group estimates that Mr. Trump\u2019s plan could reduce federal tax revenue by $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade. The economy would need to grow at a rate of 4.5 percent \u2014 more than double its projected rate, an unlikely prospect \u2014 to make the plan self-financing. While Mr. Trump and his team point to the growth linked to tax cuts passed by previous presidents, today\u2019s economy is different from that of 1981 or 2001, when Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush cut tax rates. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the federal debt will grow by $10 trillion over the next decade. By 2027, the deficit could reach $1.4 trillion, or 5 percent of the economy, it says. The office\u2019s predictions have been off before, and the impact of tax cuts on the economy is a matter of debate, as so many variables determine a country\u2019s economic fortunes. But tax historians and veterans of previous tax fights are quick to point out that lower rates are not necessarily a panacea for slow growth. \u201cThis is fool\u2019s gold that you\u2019ll cut taxes, everybody will work harder, more money will come and you\u2019ll erase the fiscal impact,\u201d said Steve Bell, who was a Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee from 1981 to 1986. \u201cIt never happens.\u201d Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, said the Trump plan appeared to have strong parallels with Reagan\u2019s 1981 cuts. Mr. Thorndike recalled that the Reagan administration soon realized the problem of the red ink it was facing and started looking for new sources of revenue. \u201cThis looks like \u201981, where they said, \u2018Deficit be damned, we want to do a tax cut,\u2019\u201d Mr. Thorndike said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cautionary tale.\u201d Twenty years later, the Bush tax cuts, which lowered the top individual tax rates and increased the standard deduction for low-income households, took place in a different environment. Mr. Bush made the case that it was time to spend the nation\u2019s surplus to jump-start a flagging economy. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to recognize that the fiscal situation today is not what it was in 2001,\u201d said Scott Greenberg of the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group. \u201cInstead of facing a large projected surplus, the country faces a large projected deficit.\u201d The White House\u2019s outline was too thin on details to allow for a concrete analysis of how much deficits would grow. There were no specifics about what income would fall into the three, instead of seven, individual tax brackets. The explanation of how the mammoth switch to a territorial corporate tax system would work was vague. There was no word on how low the tax on repatriated foreign corporate earnings would be. And Gary Cohn, the director of the president\u2019s National Economic Council, could not say how much of a tax cut a middle-income American would get. The debate over the impact of the plan is only beginning. If Republicans are not able to make the cuts revenue-neutral \u2014 that is, causing no increase in the deficit \u2014 they will need the support of Democrats to get 60 votes in the Senate and make the legislation permanent under budget reconciliation rules. Otherwise, any changes to the tax code will expire in 10 years. While Republicans in the House, Senate and Trump administration have said they do not want to add to the deficit, there is a growing acknowledgment of the possibility that they will need to settle for temporary tax cuts. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that short-term cuts were better than nothing. And Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said this week that he could live with cuts that added to the deficit if it meant getting the economy moving faster. Republican budget hawks will need to decide whether they want to stick to the arguments of fiscal responsibility that they used to bludgeon Democrats during the Obama era. One of those hawks, Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, said Wednesday, \u201cRather than conforming to arbitrary budget constraints, the president\u2019s plan rightfully aims to jump-start investment, which will produce significantly more revenue for the Treasury over the long term than any revenue-neutral tax plan could generate.\u201d Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who was a fierce critic of deficits when he was a member of Congress, offered a glimpse of the rationale his former colleagues might embrace. \u201cAs a conservative, that bothers me a little bit,\u201d he said Tuesday on CNN of the possibility that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan would increase the deficit. \u201cBut we also look at deficits through sort of a different lens.\u201d For Democrats, now out of power, the reversal is bitterly ironic, and several lawmakers assailed the president for, they said, preparing to cripple the country with debt. \u201cI\u2019m not the first to observe that a Republican Congress only cares about the deficit when a Democrat is in the White House,\u201d said Alan B. Krueger, the Princeton economist who was chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIt may be that Dick Cheney is right and that deficits don\u2019t matter to the public, but they do matter to the economy.\u201d But for Republicans who have been craving big tax cuts for years, confidence was high that the worries about deficits were overwrought. \u201cThis is a thing of beauty, a thing of wonder,\u201d Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s one-page plan. \u201cGrowth, growth, growth!\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/trump-tax-plan-budget-deficit.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T21:24:22-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T21:24:22-04:00", "abstract": "The White House insists that economic growth will offset its proposed tax cuts, but many economists disagree, creating a moment of truth for conservatives.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Tax Plan Is a Reckoning for Republican Deficit Hawks"}
