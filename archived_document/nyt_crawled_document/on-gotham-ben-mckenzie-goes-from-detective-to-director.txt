{"text": "On a cold night in January, in a dark alley off Great Jones Street in Manhattan, Bruce Wayne was getting ready to fly. This was the young, pre-Batman Bruce Wayne of the Fox series \u201cGotham,\u201d played by David Mazouz, then 15. As a stunt double was strapped into an elaborate rig and repeatedly flung backward 30 feet \u2014 the result of a punch from a powerful shaman holding Bruce captive \u2014 Mr. Mazouz waited his turn a bit uncertainly. Standing next to him, Ben McKenzie, the show\u2019s star, offered encouragement with a story from his days playing high school football. The shoot, for the 16th episode of the third season \u2014 \u201cHeroes Rise: These Delicate and Dark Obsessions,\u201d on Monday, May 1 \u2014 was unusual in a couple of ways. It was the first episode directed by Mr. McKenzie, who plays James Gordon, a Gotham City detective \u2014 not yet the police commissioner of the comic books. And, surprisingly for a superhero series, it was the first of the show\u2019s 60 episodes so far to make extensive use of wire work for action scenes. Referring to the show\u2019s creator, Bruno Heller, and showrunner, Danny Cannon, Mr. McKenzie said: \u201cOne of the things that I said to Bruno and Danny when we first started the show was: \u2018No wire work.\u2019 None of this baloney like people flying through the air. It\u2019s Batman, it\u2019s supposed to feel a little more grounded, it\u2019s supposed to feel more like the Christopher Nolan films. So, of course, I\u2019m the one director that brings in the wires.\u201d \u201cGotham\u201d was a different sort of comic-book show from the start. Conceived as 100 percent origin story \u2014 how Bruce Wayne became Batman \u2014 it was a superhero series without a superhero. The protagonist was Gordon, a cop whose only superpower was his sense of justice. The format was closer to police procedural than the angst-and-battles of most comic-book shows. In the absence of a larger-than-life hero, the show compensated by featuring its villains, including future Batman foes like the Penguin, the Riddler and a prototype of the Joker. Robin Lord Taylor, as Oswald Cobblepot, a thug who rises to become the Penguin, was the show\u2019s breakout performer. Complementing the emphasis on villainy and the story\u2019s film-noir roots have been a dark tone and a high level of violence, particularly for a broadcast-network show. Despite those differences \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 \u201cGotham\u201d has been a bit lost in the shuffle amid the proliferation of superhero series the last five years. On one side, it\u2019s overshadowed by Netflix series like \u201cJessica Jones\u201d and \u201cDaredevil,\u201d which also go for a dark tone but stick closer to the singular-hero comic-book imperative (and which have benefited from the cachet of both Netflix and Marvel Comics). On the other, it gets less attention (though more viewers) than the more lightweight, purely comics-style shows on CW like \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cSupergirl\u201d (based, like \u201cGotham,\u201d on DC Comics characters). Ranking the superhero shows is difficult because they are so different. \u201cJessica Jones\u201d stands out for the quality of its writing and performances, while \u201cThe Flash,\u201d at times, is the most purely exhilarating. But if you like the dark version of Batman popularized in the comics by Frank Miller and onscreen by Mr. Nolan, then \u201cGotham,\u201d with its grimness and its distinctive (and expensive) retro visual style, measures up. \u201cAt first you\u2019re trying to figure out what the show isn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cWe wanted to be, very specifically, not a show with true \u2018superheroes\u2019 dressed in white tights, running faster than the speed of light. There\u2019s so many of them out there. Now that we know what the show is, we break our own rules a bit.\u201d Mr. McKenzie \u2014 who had wanted to direct since his tenure on TNT\u2019s \u201cSouthland,\u201d which was canceled before he had the chance \u2014 said his episode was more quiet than most. \u201cThe only constructive criticism I got was that it was \u2018still,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is one of the things I like.\u201d But that stillness incorporated not just a decapitation but several shootings, an attack with a garden tool and a suicide. \u201cYou know, it had some violence,\u201d he acknowledged. As director, he handled one bloody scene by focusing primarily on the face of the aggressor, the Penguin. \u201cI like it when our show is able to go to wherever we need to go to, violence-wise, but with a certain, let\u2019s call it class,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always knifing and dicing in the show, but even that\u2019s relatively elegant. So that\u2019s how I tried to handle that.\u201d Mr. McKenzie\u2019s episode was the second half of a pair that began with \u201cHow the Riddler Got His Name,\u201d in which the character Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) assumed his comic-book persona. An important part of the Riddler story was the death of a woman he loved \u2014 the latest in a long line of female deaths on the show. \u201cRight, right,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said as he listened to a list of female victims. \u201cNygma\u2019s lover died because that was our way of marking his change from a studious and reserved lab technician to a full-fledged version of the Riddler. People can criticize the show any way they like. My concern is always, are they dying for a reason? Whichever gender.\u201d You might not find that answer satisfactory, but there\u2019s a basic truth to it: The show is what it is, a violent, male-centric comic-book adaptation (with, to be fair, several female characters who are stronger and more menacing than most such shows can boast). Viewership for \u201cGotham\u201d has slipped from season to season, currently running about five million in the seven-day ratings. Fox hasn\u2019t announced whether there will be a fourth season. Whenever the show ends, Mr. McKenzie was asked, can we expect the superhero to finally appear? \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said. \u201cMustache, klieg light, Batman.\u201d He added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the other shows do. \u2018Gotham\u2019 is taking the biggest piece of red meat in the comics world, Batman, and trying to take this one specific sliver of it and cook it really, really well and serve it to you. I always hope we\u2019re Steve McQueen in the classic car with the bomber jacket. An archetypal show.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/television/on-gotham-ben-mckenzie-goes-from-detective-to-director.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T17:07:27-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T17:07:27-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. McKenzie, who plays James Gordon, talks about his noir city filled with villains and what it was like to direct the show.", "title": "On \u2018Gotham,\u2019 Ben McKenzie Goes From Detective to Director"}
