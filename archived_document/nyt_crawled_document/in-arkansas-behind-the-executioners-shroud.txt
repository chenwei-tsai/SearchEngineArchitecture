{"text": "When a three-drug lethal-injection cocktail was administered to Ledell Lee at 11:44 p.m. Central time last Thursday \u2014 the first to render him unconscious, the second to halt his breathing, and the third to stop his heart \u2014 Alan Blinder and Manny Fernandez, two New York Times journalists, were huddled in the Cummins Unit prison\u2019s large visitation room. It had been converted into a makeshift media center, close to but cut off from the execution chamber. Arkansas\u2019s supply of midazolam, the first drug in the cocktail, is set to expire at the end of April, and, in a race against the clock, the state began last week with an unprecedented plan to carry out eight executions in 10 days. The Times has been reporting from Arkansas since April 17. Since then, four executions have been blocked and three have been carried out \u2014 including two this past Monday, the first time in nearly 17 years that a state has executed two inmates on the same day. Another man, Kenneth Williams, is scheduled to die on Thursday. When the Times reporters, Mr. Blinder and Mr. Fernandez, arrived at the prison on April 20, they were allowed to bring only one laptop and a single Wi-Fi hot spot\u2014 and no cellphone \u2014 between the two of them. Shortly after 11:30 p.m. local time, an announcement came from a prison spokesman that the state was commencing with Mr. Lee\u2019s execution. The media room grew quiet. \u201cWe\u2019d gotten word by then that the courts had lifted all the stays, that there was nothing blocking the execution,\u201d Mr. Blinder said. \u201cAnd then we waited.\u201d Although certain aspects of the execution process in Arkansas hint at an outward sense of transparency \u2014 the state allowed three journalists to witness the execution in a room adjacent to the execution chamber, for instance \u2014 much of the process is shielded from view. \u201cArkansas is very secretive about its execution procedures,\u201d said Mr. Blinder, who has reported on criminal justice issues from more than a dozen states. \u201cIn terms of what can be made public \u2014 the logistics, the people involved, their background, their training \u2014 there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about their approach to this.\u201d The state of Arkansas, he added, also refuses to disclose the manufacturers and the sellers of its execution drugs. (The pharmaceutical industry disclosed some information during litigation.) Other states, including Georgia and Texas, where Mr. Blinder and Mr. Fernandez have covered executions, respectively, similarly veil information about capital punishment. In Georgia, for example, a law classifies identifying information about the execution team as \u201ca confidential state secret.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge when you\u2019re trying to cover the execution and you don\u2019t have a road map for how exactly the execution might proceed,\u201d he added. Of course, the state\u2019s attempts to shield certain information regarding executions were not the only complicating factors. Reporting on executions is inherently challenging, given the intensely emotional atmosphere and the extreme public scrutiny. Those involved \u2014 from state officials to the family members of both the victim and the inmate \u2014 are often hesitant to speak with the press. And emotions, understandably, run high. \u201cA lot of complex issues emerge over the course of these stories,\u201d Mr. Blinder said, \u201cand many of them get at some of the most fundamental questions that we face as a society \u2014 like whether the state should be putting people to death, and, if so, how.\u201d But there are other questions, too, Mr. Blinder said \u2014 lingering questions about an inmate\u2019s guilt, or about the fairness and thoroughness of the legal system. \u201cAll these substantive debates are swirling around when it comes to executions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd suddenly they all come home to roost.\u201d Through it all, Mr. Blinder adheres to one rule: Do not blindly accept the state\u2019s account of the execution. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the most important parts of reporting on these stories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wait to hear from the media witnesses who observed the execution \u2014 to tell us if they saw anything abnormal, or improper, or to relay if anything had gone wrong with the execution.\u201d In the case of Mr. Lee\u2019s execution, the three reporters returned to the media room from the witnessing room shortly after Mr. Lee was pronounced dead and reported no obvious complications. Mr. Lee\u2019s eyes began to droop about a minute after the injection began, according to one of the reporters who was present, and the inmate showed no signs of suffering. Mr. Blinder and Mr. Fernandez\u2019s experience of the event, though, was much more removed. Just before midnight, a phone in the visitation room began to ring, and a spokesman for the prison system \u2014 seated next to it, also waiting \u2014 lifted it from the receiver. He nodded, and made a few notes, then hung up the phone and made his way to a lectern in front of the few dozen journalists from various media outlets who were gathered there. The execution had been carried out, the spokesman said; Mr. Lee was pronounced dead at 11:56 p.m. Not much later, after hearing from the witnesses, Mr. Blinder and Mr. Fernandez filed their story, packed up their laptop and left.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/insider/in-arkansas-behind-the-executioners-shroud.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Times Insider", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T07:23:45-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T07:23:45-04:00", "abstract": "Two New York Times reporters were on hand, in a media room, when the state executed an inmate before a lethal injection drug was set to expire.", "title": "In Arkansas, Behind the Executioner\u2019s Shroud"}
