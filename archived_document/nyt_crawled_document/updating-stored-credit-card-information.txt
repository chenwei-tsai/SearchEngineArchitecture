{"text": "Q. How do I change the billing information for iPad app purchases? A. You can update your credit card number, address or other details about the way you pay for your iTunes and App Store downloads by opening the Settings icon from the iPad\u2019s home screen and selecting iTunes & App Store. In the box that pops up, tap View Apple ID and sign in, if prompted. On the Apple ID screen, select Payment Information from the list, and on the next screen, make the changes you wish. Apple notes that if you are using its Family Sharing feature to corral all purchases made by members of a designated family group, only the user previously deemed the \u201corganizer\u201d can change the payment information. If you are having trouble trying to remove a linked credit card from your account by switching to None as a billing option, make sure you have no outstanding charges with the iTunes or App Stores \u2014 or subscriptions that automatically renew and bill that credit card. You can also change your Apple billing information from your Windows PC or Mac computer. To get to your settings from the desktop, open the iTunes program, go to the Account menu and select View My Account. Sign in with your account password (or click the View Account button if you are already signed in) and on the account settings screen, click the Edit button next to payment type to make your changes. The process for changing billing information is similar for other companies that keep your electronic payment method on file \u2014 like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and apps that offer purchases or subscriptions. Simply find the account settings area, log in and locate the section for payment details. Just make sure you are on a secure network connection when you do.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/technology/personaltech/updating-stored-credit-card-information.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Technology", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T12:34:02-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Question", "created_date": "2017-05-02T12:34:02-04:00", "abstract": "Apple keeps your payment and billing information on file, but visit your account settings if you need to make a change.", "title": "Updating Stored Credit Card Information for the App Store"}
