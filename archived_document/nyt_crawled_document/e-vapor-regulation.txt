Unfortunately, some aspects of the F.D.A.\u2019s new regulatory approach to e-vapor products create significant regulatory barriers for e-vapor products and the nine million adult vapers who use them. Indeed, the F.D.A.\u2019s approach treats e-vapor products more harshly than cigarettes. This is not what Congress intended. We support the bipartisan Cole-Bishop legislation mentioned in your editorial because it maintains the F.D.A.\u2019s authority to regulate e-vapor products while also preserving the ability for us and thousands of other companies to create innovative products that might reduce risk for adult smokers. The legislation also requires the agency to go further on issues like under-age access prevention and battery safety standards, areas that the agency has yet to address. JOE MURILLO, RICHMOND, VA. The writer is vice president for regulatory affairs at Altria.", "abstract": "The tobacco company Altria says the new federal regulatory approach creates significant barriers for consumers."}
