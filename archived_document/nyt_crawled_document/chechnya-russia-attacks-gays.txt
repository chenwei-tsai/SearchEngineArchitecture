They Shock You\u2019: Inside the Anti-Gay Pogrom in Chechnya", "material_type_facet": "News", "text": "GROZNY, Russia \u2014 It was supposed to be a night out. But for the young man who calls himself Maksim, as for scores of other gay men arrested in a pogrom this month in Russia\u2019s Chechnya region, it pivoted into nearly two weeks of beatings and torture. Maksim said it had started with a chat room conversation with \u201ca very good old friend who is also gay,\u201d and who suggested that they meet at an apartment. When Maksim arrived, however, he was greeted not by his friend but by agents who beat him. Later, they strapped him to a chair, attached electrical wires to his hands with alligator clips and began an interrogation. \u201cThey yelled, \u2018Who else do you know?\u2019\u201d Maksim said, and zapped him with current from time to time. \u201cIt was unbearably painful; I was hanging on with my last strength,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t tell them anything.\u201d Gay men have never had an easy life in Chechnya. But the targeted, collective punishment of gays that began last month under its pro-Kremlin leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, is a new turn in the region\u2019s long history of rights abuses. Novaya Gazeta, an opposition newspaper, first reported the pogrom, saying that at least 100 gay men had been arrested and three killed in the roundup. Human Rights Watch corroborated those findings. The sweep has been widely condemned by Western governments, the United Nations and rights groups. Activists in Russia have set up an underground network to spirit the victims out of Chechnya and to protect them from potentially violent reprisals from their families and others. The victims use assumed names in their everyday dealings. The following account is based on interviews with Maksim, who is in his 20s, and two other gay men who were detained by Chechen security agents. Homosexuality is taboo in Chechnya and the mostly Muslim surrounding areas of the Caucasus region in southern Russia. \u201cThis society is highly homophobic,\u201d said Ekaterina L. Sokiryanskaya, Russia project director for the International Crisis Group and an authority on Chechnya. \u201cHomosexuality is condemned. It is believed Islam considers it a great sin.\u201d Nevertheless, before the crackdown, gay men in Chechnya could at least lead social lives, if heavily closeted ones, Maksim said. They met largely in private chat rooms on social networking sites with names like the Village or What the Mountains Are Silent About. \u201cWhen two gay men meet, they don\u2019t tell one another their true names,\u201d Maksim said. Men met at cafes or at apartments rented for a night, he said. \u201cNobody suspected my sexual orientation, not even my best friends.\u201d The crackdown began after GayRussia, a rights group based in Moscow, applied for permits for gay pride parades in the Caucasus region, prompting counterprotests by religious groups, the men said. In Chechnya, it became something even worse \u2014 a mass \u201cprophylactic\u201d cleansing of homosexuals, the security service agents told the gay men as they rounded them up. The men were held for as little as a day or as long as several weeks, according to Human Rights Watch and to interviews with gay men who later escaped the region. Some \u201creturned to their families barely alive from beatings,\u201d said Tanya Lokshina, Russia program director for Human Rights Watch. Among the fatalities documented by the organization were one man who succumbed during torture and two others who died in \u201chonor killings\u201d by relatives after the police released them. \u201cHuman Rights Watch has been getting numerous reports about attacks by security services under Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s control, and those reports are extremely disturbing,\u201d Ms. Lokshina said. \u201cThis is another opportunity to reinforce the culture of fear.\u201d The Chechen authorities\u2019 response to the global outrage over the pogrom has provoked new incredulity. In a telephone interview, Mr. Kadyrov\u2019s spokesman, Alvi Karimov, said the reports of an anti-gay pogrom had to be false because such men did not exist in Chechnya. \u201cIn Grozny, have you ever noticed people who, by their appearance or manners, resemble people who are oriented in the wrong way?\u201d Mr. Karimov asked. \u201cA policy is developed for a problem,\u201d he said, referring to a report that said the arrests were official policy. \u201cI can officially say there is no policy because there is no problem. If there were a problem, there would be a policy.\u201d In a televised meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Wednesday, Mr. Kadyrov characterized as \u201clibelous\u201d news reports that the security services in Chechnya had been persecuting gay men. And on Thursday, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told journalists that the Russian authorities had found no evidence that the Chechen police had arrested gay men. But it quickly became clear to Maksim and the other men that the Chechen authorities were applying the same tactics used by Russia and by Mr. Kadyrov to suppress an Islamist insurgency in the region over the past decade. Security service agents took to posing as gay men looking for dates on the Village and in other chat rooms, or persuaded those they had already captured to lure acquaintances, those arrested said in interviews. Fear spread among gay Chechens. \u201cIf they caught him, they will get to me,\u201d said a 20-year-old student who identified himself as Ilya and who was interviewed at a safe location outside Chechnya. Ilya fled days before the police showed up at his home, he learned later. The authorities briefly detained another young man, who identified himself as Nohcho, after a friend informed on him during an interrogation. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him,\u201d Nohcho said of the friend. \u201cWe are not heroes. We\u2019re just gay guys. They starve you. They shock you.\u201d That, it seems, is essentially what happened to Maksim, who had been corresponding with his gay acquaintance for some time. \u201cOne day, he suggested we meet for a drink,\u201d Maksim said. \u201cAnd because we knew each other a long time, I did not suspect he would be capable of something like this.\u201d When Maksim entered the apartment where they had agreed to meet, security officers roughed him up. Five other men were already in the apartment, lured by the same ruse, he said. His account of the deception used to detain him was consistent with others documented by Human Rights Watch and with the accounts of the two other gay men interviewed separately for this article. All six of the men in the apartment were transferred to a makeshift cell in an abandoned building, where they were tortured with electricity one by one, Maksim said. After 11 days, he was released to a male relative, who was told that Maksim was gay. The security officers told the captives\u2019 male relatives that, if they had any honor, they would kill the young men, Maksim and Ilya said. Maksim\u2019s father threatened to beat him but refrained when his son showed him the bruises he already had. Instead his father said, \u201cI should kill you.\u201d Fearing for his life, Maksim turned to a gay rights group, the Russian LGBT Network, based in St. Petersburg, which has established an emergency, round-the-clock volunteer group to help gay men escape the region. To reassure the victims they are trying to help, the activists have taken extraordinary precautions, operating virtually as a partisan cell behind enemy lines, though they have done nothing illegal under Russian law. \u201cThese people don\u2019t trust anybody,\u201d said Olga Baranova, director of the Moscow Community Center, a support group for gays that is part of the volunteer network helping gay men flee Chechnya. After arriving at the safe location outside Chechnya, several young men said they had suspected that the volunteer group was also a trap but had no other option but to accept the help, Ms. Baranova said. \u201cThey say, \u2018We didn\u2019t believe you were real,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018We thought this was the last effort to round up whoever was left.\u2019\u201d The network bought airplane tickets for Chechen gay men, found safe houses and arranged for doctors to treat those who had been badly beaten. \u201cGays in Chechnya and the North Caucasus are in lethal danger,\u201d Igor Kochetkov, director of the Russian LGBT Network, said in a telephone interview. \u201cPeople whose partners are detained have every reason to believe they will be arrested. It is very hard not to name the names under torture.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T09:55:40-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/europe/chechnya-russia-attacks-gays.html", "item_type": "Article"}
