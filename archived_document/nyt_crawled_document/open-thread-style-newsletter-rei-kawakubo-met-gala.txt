{"text": "Each week, the Open Thread newsletter will offer a look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper. The inaugural newsletter appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Happy Monday \u2014 and welcome to the first issue of Open Thread, The New York Times\u2019s weekly guide to the forces, from business to politics, that shape the dress codes we all obey and the ways we use clothes to communicate ideas, culture and identity. In my almost two decades of covering fashion, from ateliers to executive suites and inaugurations, it\u2019s become very clear to me that whether we like to admit it or not, we all use our wardrobes to manipulate other people \u2014 and get manipulated ourselves. And it\u2019s about time we talk about it. Yes, there\u2019s a whole semiology behind that cute skirt or power tie you are wearing. It\u2019s time to own the message, not just the item. En garde! O.K., enough of that. Still, for anyone who doubts the ability of fashion to affect perception, I give you the Met Gala \u2014 perhaps the best people-watching event of the year, get the popcorn now \u2014 as Exhibit A. Officially the opening benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s big Costume Institute show, the event, which takes place tonight, is the ultimate fashion-meets-Wall-Street-meets-Hollywood moment, where power brokers from near and far convene and attempt to outdo one another in the stakes of wearable art. This year should be particularly jaw-dropping, since the exhibit the gala celebrates is a one-woman show dedicated to Rei Kawakubo, the founder of the Japanese brand Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, and only the second living designer ever to be granted a retrospective at the museum. (The first was Yves Saint Laurent, in 1983.) Ms. Kawakubo\u2019s work challenges all conventional notions of beauty, femininity and the way garments are constructed; she dares to go where most designers \u2014 and, frankly, people \u2014 do not. Once, I talked to her backstage after a show and her explanation of her collection was: \u201cI was trying not to make clothes.\u201d Seriously. Instead, she makes concepts. The red carpet will never be the same. Check in with us throughout the night for live updates on the evening and for morning-after reviews \u2014 plus an exclusive walk-through of the exhibit with Ms. Kawakubo. If you don\u2019t want to wait, however, this photo essay in The New York Times Magazine offers a preview: The most recent Comme des Gar\u00e7ons collection transforms the model Saskia de Brauw into Fausto Melotti-like sculptures. Also bags of Jiffy Pop. But if you have had enough fashion-as-high-art-thank-you-very-much, check out our take on 100 days of Trump style (a.k.a. the transition from self-branding to state branding) or a guide to the essentials every man needs for summer. For this and more, read on. And then send me an email or a tweet with what you\u2019d like to see more or less of in this newsletter \u2014 and ask me your fashion questions. I\u2019ll answer one each week. Every week on Open Thread, Vanessa will answer a reader\u2019s fashion-related question, which you can send to her anytime via email or Twitter. Q: \u201cStockings or no for 60 yr young woman. Been getting by with opaque tights and boots in NYC but spring is here!\u201d \u2014 MEIGHAN CORBETT, @MeighanCorbett A: As far as I am concerned, this is an ageless issue, and one with which I also wrestle (at \u2014 full disclosure \u2014 49). Once upon a time I would have said this was a question of \u201cwhat is appropriate dress,\u201d but these days such rules no longer really apply. While the Duchess of Cambridge still wears sheer hose pretty much every time she appears in public in a skirt, no matter the season, Michelle Obama, for example, rejected that rule when she was first lady \u2014 and left the door open for us all to follow her lead. Recently, at the W20 Summit in Berlin, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., wore sheer hose during her panel discussion with Ivanka Trump and Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, who did\u2026 not. In the end, it comes down to what makes you comfortable. I am an opaque tights acolyte during the winter, favoring matte black Spanx pretty much every day, but come April, I can\u2019t bring myself to put them on, despite the fact it isn\u2019t always warm enough to go bare legged. I generally avoid the whole issue by wearing pants (I know: cop-out), but for those who want a little smoothness with their skirts, Anita Leclerc, our fashion editor, offers up the following tip: \u201cOn those days when fastidiously applying faux tan just isn\u2019t worth the flaking and fretting, I wear Naked 8 tights from Wolford. They\u2019re ultrafine, airy and a dead-on match for my pale skin. (They come in a variety of shades.) Take that, fashion police. But also take note: While colorful tights look cool with sandals \u2014 the look has been all over the runways \u2014 do not wear sheer hose with open-toe sandals. Doing so practically screams DOWDY.\u201d \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMAN", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/fashion/open-thread-style-newsletter-rei-kawakubo-met-gala.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T09:30:41-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T09:30:41-04:00", "abstract": "We\u2019re here to discuss clothes, what they mean \u2014 and how to wear them.", "title": "Welcome to Open Thread, Our New Fashion Newsletter"}
