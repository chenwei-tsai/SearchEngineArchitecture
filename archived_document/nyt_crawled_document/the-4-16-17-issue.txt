{"text": "RE: RECONSIDERING THE RIGHT Rick Perlstein wrote about the new direction of American conservatism after the election of Donald Trump. Historians of American political culture have actually done pretty well understanding the race and class dynamics of the \u201chard-hat conservatism\u201d that Perlstein sees as having fueled the Trump election. What they don\u2019t get is the more diffuse, anti-rational, emotion-driven energies that animate large parts of the electorate. Magical thinking has always had a prominent place in American popular culture. It has been normalized most recently by the rise of prosperity gospels, remote-prayer healing and power-of-mind texts like \u201cThe Secret.\u201d Unlike proto-fascism and racism, however, such commitments typically seem ridiculous and unworthy of scrutiny to secular intellectuals. Yes, the bigoted history of 20th-century populism is one tradition that led to Trump\u2019s election. But we can\u2019t understand populism \u2014 in 2017 or in American history more broadly \u2014 unless we fully engage with its adherents\u2019 underlying epistemologies. Such an engagement means first acknowledging, as Richard Hofstadter did, that those ways of thinking are different from our own. Next, we have to try to find a way to work with those adherents. Hofstadter failed spectacularly at that; I\u2019d like to see Rick Perlstein at least try. Trysh Travis, Gainesville, Fla. Although Rick Perlstein encourages historians of the American right in the age of Trump to be more \u201cimpolite\u201d in their assessments of the movement, he treads surprisingly lightly when it comes to race\u2019s place in the story of that movement. His focus is on connections with European-style fascism, immigration backlash and the politicization of advertising and reality television. While all of these have certainly played a role in the rise of the movement that brought Trump to power, it is impossible to imagine the rise of Trump without focusing squarely on two primary factors: the right\u2019s unwavering hostility to the nation\u2019s first African-American president and Trump\u2019s harnessing of racist impulses in the white working-class electorate that had been allowed to simmer but came to a full boil in 2016. Underplaying the central role of race in that story is a disservice to the readership of this magazine. Clinton J. Guthrie, Queens I was surprised by Rick Perlstein\u2019s self-flagellating confession in the magazine. I\u2019ve thought for some time that he is one of our best chroniclers of the rise of a determined, resilient and mercurial American Right. In his books, Perlstein has written deftly and vividly about the cultural undercurrents and strains of racial animus and populist anger that were missed or dismissed by many who had prematurely declared the extreme right permanently overextended or on the verge of extinction. In fact, watching the political drama of the primary and general elections unfold over the past two years, I was reminded of his books and thought, This is Perlstein\u2019s next book, writing itself. Unlike the author, I was not surprised by the outcome of the last election, in part, because of reading his rich and insightful history of the modern conservative movement. Paul Scully, Collingswood, N.J. RE: MIKE JUDGE Willy Staley profiled Mike Judge, the creator of \u201cIdiocracy\u201d and co-creator of \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d as America\u2019s foremost chronicler of its own self-destructive tendencies. After reading this article, I Googled Judge. I found an old skit similar to Sean Spicer\u2019s gaffe about the Holocaust. In it, a talk-show host interviews a multimillionaire who complains about Holocaust-like persecution of multimillionaires. One concludes that Judge\u2019s assessment of the American soul is as prescient as the article states. Sidney Vaneyck Sisk, Avon, Conn. Describing \u201cIdiocracy\u201d as anything approaching prescient is purposefully misinterpreting events to fit the narrative and is hypocritical from a liberal point of view. Let us not forget the beginning of \u201cIdiocracy,\u201d in which the poor family, portrayed as dumb and trashy, was procreating out of control. The intelligent and educated couple waits, struggles, then eventually has a single child. This is the setup to explain how things get to where they are in 2505 \u2014 \u201cdumb\u201d people breeding like rabbits and \u201csmart\u201d people not. Eventually this imbalance turns the country into a society full of morons. I would suppose that outside the context of this article, most liberal-minded folks (myself included) would find the insinuation that poor equals dumb offensive. For some reason, this film seems to get a pass. We surely give conservatives and the Republican Party a lot of flak for their siding with the wealthy and privileged and valuing a person\u2019s wealth as a major metric of his worth. Isn\u2019t that effectively what \u201cIdiocracy\u201d is doing?
