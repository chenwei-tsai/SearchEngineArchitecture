{"text": "BEIJING \u2014 In a shopping mall in southern China, a polar bear named Pizza paces past murals of icebergs in his glass enclosure. He shakes his shaggy head under artificial lights. He crouches by an air vent to sniff the outside world. All are distress behaviors, say Chinese animal welfare advocates, who on Tuesday called on Zhu Xiaodan, the governor of Guangdong Province, where Pizza lives in an aquarium at the Grandview Mall in Guangzhou, to move the bear to a more appropriate environment. Pizza has become known as \u201cthe world\u2019s saddest polar bear,\u201d the advocates, from 48 organizations, wrote in an open letter to Mr. Zhu. They added that they hoped that \u201cthe Guangdong government would close Grandview Polar Sea World.\u201d Hundreds of animals are housed in small enclosures over several floors of the mall, including arctic wolves and beluga whales. They share the retail emporium with an electronic games arcade for children, a 3-D movie theater, a supermarket and leading domestic and international clothing brands. Escalators in an atrium run past signs advertising Swarovski and Est\u00e9e Lauder products, noodle restaurants and coffee shops. The activists say Pizza\u2019s plight is part of a disturbing trend in China: exhibiting wild animals in malls to attract customers as more people turn to often cheaper and more convenient e-commerce. At a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday, representatives of four of the animal welfare groups showed reporters photographs of an elephant used to sell cellphones outside a mall on the outskirts of Beijing and sea lions offered for interactions with shoppers who spend more than 500 renminbi, about $75, at another mall in Beijing. A \u201cmall zoo\u201d similar to Grandview is under consideration in Shijiazhuang, in Hebei Province, they said. \u201cAnimals deserve so much better than being enclosed in a glass box, with very little in it, to attract shoppers,\u201d said Hu Chunmei of the Endangered Species Fund. \u201cIt shows a complete lack of regard for their welfare.\u201d In Beijing, squirrels, parrots, llamas and goats, as well as domestic animals such as cats and dogs, are sometimes displayed in cages or glass enclosures in shopping malls. At lunchtime, the crowds massed around them can be several people deep. Asked to comment this week, the Grandview Mall aquarium defended itself against the criticism, which has spread around the world. Recently, the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in England offered to take in Pizza \u2014 an offer indignantly declined by the aquarium. \u201cPizza is very healthy,\u201d it said in an emailed statement, adding that the aquarium was engaged in scientific education and research and in the protection of biodiversity. \u201cYou can\u2019t entirely separate animal welfare from these social benefits.\u201d The aquarium is no different from other facilities in China or the world, the statement said. It has 130 specialists caring for its hundreds of animals, it said. News reports that Pizza is suffering in inadequate conditions are distorted and have been referred to the authorities, it said, in a thinly veiled warning of possible legal action. Pizza is popular with shoppers, according to reports in the Chinese news media, with thousands of people visiting on peak days to take selfies and knock on the glass. Wild animals like polar bears require a large natural habitat to maintain their physical and mental health, said Wendy Higgins, a spokeswoman for Humane Society International. \u201cTheir environment is so unique. They\u2019re such wide-ranging animals, and they start to decline quite rapidly in captivity,\u201d Ms. Higgins said in a telephone interview. \u201cPizza spends every single day on his own with nowhere to hide, just subjected to people banging on the glass and taking photographs,\u201d she said. Qin Xiaona, the director of the Capital Animal Welfare Association, said that criticism by the mall management, which has accused the activists of doing foreigners\u2019 bidding, was an insult to China\u2019s people and culture. \u201cThey say, \u2018You are using a Western point of view\u2019 in order to oppose us,\u201d Ms. Qin said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t forget that we have a tradition in China of \u2018respecting heaven, caring for animals.\u2019 \u201d She added, \u201cBecause of economic competition, we\u2019ve regressed,\u201d leading to the widespread abuse of animals \u2014 and people \u2014 in recent decades. \u201cWe want to revive our tradition,\u201d she said. Yu Hongmei of VShine, an organization in Dalian, agreed on the impulse behind the campaign to help the animals at Grandview Mall: \u201cIt\u2019s not foreign. It\u2019s our tradition, too.\u2019\u2019 China has not had an animal welfare law since the 1930s, under the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, who was defeated by the Communists in 1949. A Wildlife Protection Law came into force in 1989 and was updated in July, but it allows the capture and breeding of wild animals for commercial purposes and permits the use of wild animals for public displays and performances. A draft law on animal cruelty that would extend protection to pets, farm livestock and laboratory animals was proposed in 2009 but has yet to be adopted. Practices such as the dog meat festival in Yulin continue to attract headlines. Calls to the Guangzhou provincial government and the Guangzhou Industrial and Commercial Bureau for comment on Tuesday went unanswered.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/world/asia/china-polar-bear-shopping-mall.html", "published_date": "2016-10-24T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T10:00:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T10:00:05-04:00", "abstract": "The bear, named Pizza, is showing signs of distress, advocates say, adding that using wild animals to attract customers is a disturbing trend in China.", "title": "The \u2018Saddest\u2019 Polar Bear Lives in a Mall in China"}
