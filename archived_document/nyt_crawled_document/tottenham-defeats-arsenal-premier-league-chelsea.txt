{"text": "LONDON \u2014 Dele Alli and Harry Kane kept Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League title hunt with a 2-0 victory over Arsenal on Sunday in White Hart Lane\u2019s final North London derby. Chelsea had extended its advantage to 7 points by winning, 3-0, at Everton earlier in the day, but Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Spurs cut the gap back to 4 points with a thrilling display. The two goals arrived within 146 seconds of each other in the second half, with Alli polishing off a rebound and Kane converting a penalty. The victory also ensured that Spurs will finish above Arsenal for the first time since 1995, ending 22 years of what is know as St Totteringham\u2019s Day \u2014 the unofficial holiday celebrated by Arsenal fans when their team could no longer be overtaken by Tottenham in the league table. Spurs will play at Wembley next season before moving into its new stadium \u2014 which is being built partly on the site of the team\u2019s current home \u2014 in August 2018. Sunday\u2019s win was Tottenham\u2019s ninth in a row. Arsenal Manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s 50th North London derby ended with a fifth defeat in six away games for the Gunners, leaving Arsenal six points out of a Champions League slot in sixth place. Arsenal retains a game in hand on its other rivals, however, and its disappointment was mitigated by the fact top-four rivals Manchester City and Manchester United both dropped points earlier in the day.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/sports/soccer/tottenham-defeats-arsenal-premier-league-chelsea.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T14:03:58-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T14:03:58-04:00", "abstract": "Dele Alli and Harry Kane kept Tottenham in the Premier League title hunt with a 2-0 victory over Arsenal in White Hart Lane\u2019s final North London derby.", "title": "Tottenham Keeps Arsenal in Its Wake and Chelsea in Its Sights"}
