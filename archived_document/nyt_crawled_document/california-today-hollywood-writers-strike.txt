{"text": "Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) It\u2019s do-or-die time in Hollywood. If the writers\u2019 union doesn\u2019t reach a deal with the studios by midnight tonight, its thousands of members are expected to strike. It would be the entertainment capital\u2019s first major work stoppage in a decade. What\u2019s the disagreement? A three-year contract between the Writers Guild of America, whose members create the scripts for television and film, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, is set to expire May 1. In talks on a new contract, the union has demanded raises, a new pay structure that reflects the shift toward streaming services, and bigger payments for the guild\u2019s health plan. A sticking point has been over what concessions the union would make on the health plan, which has run into deficits in part because it provides extremely generous benefits. What does it mean for my shows? A strike won\u2019t cause entertainment to screech to a halt. Many scripted shows poised to air in the near term are already in the can. Movies that operate on yearslong production schedules also wouldn\u2019t feel much immediate pain. But television programs that rely on a regular diet of fresh writing could be forced to air reruns. That means soap operas, late-night staples such as \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d and weekly programs like \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d What else is at stake? If a strike were to drag on, workers who cater to Hollywood would suffer. During the last writers\u2019 strike in 2007 and 2008, thousands of people who work on sets \u2014 lighting technicians, makeup artists and others \u2014 were forced out of work. Businesses such as catering and construction also had their bottom lines hurt. All told, the 100-day shutdown cost the California economy more than $2 billion, according to the Milken Institute, a public policy think tank. What are the odds of a strike? It\u2019s hard to say. On Friday, the Times journalists John Koblin and Brooks Barnes cited people close to the talks who said headway had been made between the two sides. But for the moment, a pact remained uncertain. What\u2019s more, extensions are common in labor negotiations. If both sides believe they\u2019re close to a deal, they could extend the talks.

Adam Derewecki, 32, shared an aerial view of the neighborhood he captured about a week ago facing west from the Nob Hill neighborhood. The Richmond District is bounded by Golden Gate Park to the south, Land\u2019s End and the Presidio of San Francisco to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the west. But access to sunshine is less certain. The neighborhood\u2019s location near the Golden Gate means it\u2019s often fogbound.
