Divining the intentions of 32 N.F.L. teams, evaluating scores of players, factoring in potential trades and coming up with a list of picks that makes sense tests the mettle of even the most informed fan or pundit. And it looks like this year\u2019s mock drafts may bear even less resemblance to reality than usual. The problem starts almost at the top. Sure, pencil in Myles Garrett at No. 1, but then? \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve had a draft without a consensus No. 2,\u201d said Robby Esch, the owner of the draft site The Huddle Report. \u201cIt could be anybody. Every team in the top five has said they\u2019re willing to trade out. That will throw mock drafts.\u201d There are also a number of players whose draft position is anybody\u2019s guess. Walter Cherepinsky, the president of walterfootball.com, another draft site, said the question marks included \u201cplayers who didn\u2019t test very well and didn\u2019t do well at the combine.\u201d \u201cMike Williams of Clemson could fall out of the first round, yet we know a team that\u2019s going to consider him in the top 10,\u201d he said. Cherepinsky and Esch both say there is a great deal of uncertainty about players with character issues, like Joe Mixon, the Oklahoma running back who punched a woman in the face at a cafe. Reuben Foster of Alabama got kicked out of the combine after an altercation with a hospital worker, then was found to have a diluted drug sample. A former candidate to be drafted No. 2, he may now have fallen as far as No. 20. Good luck guessing his draft position. Medical exams at the combine found shoulder issues with another potential high pick from Alabama, defensive lineman Jonathan Allen. But how will it affect his draft position? Even the experts are not sure. \u201cAny defensive coach would love to have him,\u201d Esch said. \u201cIt depends how much teams weigh that in.\u201d And there\u2019s always the danger of something completely unexpected. No mock drafts last year accounted for a video emerging just as the draft started of highly touted Laremy Tunsil inhaling from a bong attached to a gas mask. He fell all the way to No. 13. In the face of so much uncertainty, knowing teams\u2019 tendencies is the key to a good mock draft, Cherepinsky said. \u201cThe Falcons like athletic prospects. The Patriots and the Lions focus on three-cone times,\u201d a quickness drill at the combine. \u201cThe Seahawks late in the draft go for home run picks,\u201d he said. Oddly enough, this year\u2019s uncertain draft comes as mock drafts have been improving, at least a bit. When The New York Times last looked at the mock draft phenomenon, it reported that in 2014, of 115 drafts evaluated by The Huddle Report, none had more than eight picks going to the right team in the first round. The good news is that \u201cwas the worst year for matches,\u201d Esch said. Last year, 35 of 107 got at least eight right, and two selectors got 12 right. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a simple answer to the improvement in mock performance. Esch credits the rookie salary cap for allowing teams to more readily select the player they most need, rather than the one who is most valuable. \u201cWhat it did for mock drafters is, we had to change our process,\u201d Esch said. \u201cWe used to put the high-dollar positions up high, but now I\u2019m matching teams with players.\u201d And that seems to be a little bit easier, judging by recent years\u2019 mock drafts. But Thursday night is looking like a return to the days of unpredictability. That could provide spice to a draft that\u2019s a little low on marquee names. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s as big a buzz about this draft class,\u201d Esch said. \u201cGood defensive draft, but people get excited about quarterbacks. Football coaches love this draft. Your die-hards will follow it.\u201d Judging from the ratings, and the proliferation of mock drafts, there are millions of die-hards out there.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/sports/football/nfl-mock-drafts.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T15:55:05-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "One Certain Projection in Mock N.F.L.
