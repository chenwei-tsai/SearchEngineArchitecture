The troubled 450-foot Squibb Park Bridge, a pedestrian shortcut from Brooklyn Heights to Brooklyn Bridge Park, was designed to mimic the light, airy trail bridges found in state parks, which bounce slightly underfoot as people traverse them. But after its opening in the spring of 2013, the structure\u2019s bounce went from slight to conspicuous, with the bridge also swaying from side to side, worrying users. When it closed abruptly in August of the next year, the bridge, which resembles an elongated W, was visibly distorted as well. What was billed as a temporary closing dragged on for months, then years, as a successful fix eluded the bridge\u2019s designer, a noted engineer named Ted Zoli, the recipient of a MacArthur grant. Compounding the saga was the fact that the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation, which operates the park, was strangely reticent about the exact nature of the problem and what was being done to address it. More than two years after the bridge closed, park officials declared the pedestrian structure \u201cinherently flawed.\u201d At the same time, officials announced they were bringing a lawsuit against HNTB, the engineering firm where Mr. Zoli is the chief bridge engineer, charging breach of contract and professional misconduct. The bridge was closed for 32 months, nearly double the time it was open, an embarrassment for leaders of the enormously popular park whose 1.3-mile expanse along the East River is still being developed. But now, after $2.5 million in repairs for a bridge that originally cost $4.1 million, officials say the bridge is safe and ready for a comeback. \u201cPeople love the bridge, both for its utility and its aesthetic and its bounce,\u201d said David Lowin, vice president of real estate for the corporation who, until recently, served as its interim president. \u201cWe were very, very happy that we were able to find a solution that keeps the bridge in place.\u201d Despite assurances from officials that the bounce was still palpable, the engineering firm that oversaw the retrofit has toned it down significantly: the movement underfoot registers as more of a vibration now. Of course, not everyone liked the bounce. Some residents said it made them feel queasy; others found it frightening. More than a few avoided the shortcut offered by the bridge, which starts at Squibb Park, an expanse of asphalt at Columbia Heights and Middagh Street, and zigzags over Furman Street down to Brooklyn Bridge Park. That was especially true once the bridge, which is fashioned of black locust, steel and concrete, started to gyrate and appear out of kilter. Mr. Zoli, the designer, later admitted in a memorandum to park officials that one part of the bridge \u201ctwisted toward the south,\u201d while another \u201ctwisted toward the north.\u201d Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor for the city who is chairwoman of the corporation\u2019s board, said the park was determined to pursue repairs, even as the lawsuit inched along. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the litigation to impede our ability to move forward and get this bridge open as soon as possible,\u201d Ms. Glen said. \u201cThis is such a great amenity to the neighborhood. It was better to spend the money necessary to fix the bridge and then try to recover as much money as possible.\u201d When HNTB was trying to design a solution for the bridge, park officials estimated that the repairs would cost about $700,000. In fact, the final repair work will run nearly four times that much. Ms. Glen said she was confident that \u201cat the end of the day, we will recover a significant portion of the costs.\u201d In early 2016, in announcing it would seek $3 million in damages against HNTB, the park corporation said it would bring in Arup, an international engineering firm. Arup had been hired to conduct the peer review of the earlier efforts by HNTB to fix the bridge. After it replaced HNTB, Arup devised its own retrofit intended to increase stability and reduce movement. To improve stability, engineers clamped the cable that runs beneath the bridge to the diagonal timber trusses that line the two center spans. Originally, that cable slid freely through plastic sleeves attached to the trusses. In addition, bolts were added to each truss to secure the steel caps at their ends; previously, the caps were attached only with epoxy. Finally, Arup placed a series of large tuned mass dampers \u2014 similar to shock absorbers on a car \u2014 on the underside of the bridge to control the bounce. \u201cAs people walk across the bridge, their motion causes the tuned mass dampers to vibrate and that vibration causes energy to be dissipated,\u201d said Tom Wilcock, an associate principal at Arup. \u201cThe bridge is bouncing less than half of what it was before.\u201d As she led visitors across the bridge in a pink hard hat, Pat Kirshner, vice president of capital operations for the park corporation, seemed to anticipate the public\u2019s first question. \u201cThere\u2019s still a spring in your step,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can quote that.\u201d Most likely, the general public will not notice the retrofits, which are underneath the bridge. \u201cIt\u2019s quite subtle in terms of the visual impact on the structure,\u201d Mr. Wilcock said. One of the harshest critics of the corporation during the bridge\u2019s long closing was Daniel L. Squadron, a state senator whose district includes Brooklyn Bridge Park. He had demanded a detailed accounting of the bridge\u2019s defects, faulting officials for what he called a lack of transparency. But last week, Mr. Squadron focused less on the bridge\u2019s troubled history than its imminent reopening. \u201cSquibb Bridge was a great amenity the first time around and it\u2019s good to see it bounce back for Round 2,\u201d Mr. Squadron said in an interview. \u201cThe delay was frustrating, but I know that it will immediately become part of the fabric of this community again. I\u2019ll take less bounce for more safety, any day.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Brooklyn Walkway to Reopen, With Less Bounce in Your Steps", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "abstract": "Closed for 32 months, a pedestrian bridge between Brooklyn Heights and Brooklyn Bridge Park designed to sway underfoot will reopen, with a little less spring.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/nyregion/brooklyn-squibb-park-bridge-reopening.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-17T15:06:19-04:00"}
