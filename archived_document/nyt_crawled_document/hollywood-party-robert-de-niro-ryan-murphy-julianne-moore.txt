{"section": "Fashion & Style", "text": "\u201cIt is a great tradition in France, the salon,\u201d said Diana Widmaier-Picasso, a granddaughter of Pablo Picasso, who hosted a crowd of Oscar and Emmy winners at her Gramercy Park brownstone in Manhattan on Monday night. The party was sponsored by SAG-Aftra, the union that represents performers in movies, radio and television, and the guest of honor was Ryan Murphy, the director and producer of \u201cFeud,\u201d \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cAmerican Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m nervous,\u201d Mr. Murphy said as he spoke to a crowd that included Matthew Broderick, Robert De Niro, Ron Howard, Debra Messing, Alfred Molina, Julianne Moore, David O. Russell and Susan Sarandon. \u201cI\u2019ve employed half the people in this room.\u201d Marisa Tomei sat on a fur-covered bed in the living room, her feet dangling over the edge. \u201cIsn\u2019t anyone going to sit with me?\u201d she said. Questlove laughed and took her photograph. In another part of the house, the director Baz Luhrmann told Ansel Elgort, the 23-year-old actor and son of the fashion photographer Arthur Elgort, about his recent trip to Disney World. Nearby, Mr. Murphy huddled with two stars he has worked with, Jessica Lange and Sarah Paulson. Mr. Murphy, 51, has done a lot for women in Hollywood, having started a foundation to hire women and minority candidates to direct half the episodes of the shows he produces. But he is going against the tide: The number of women working in top jobs in the entertainment industry declined in 2016, according to a report by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University. \u201cWe need to find a way to create access,\u201d said Gabrielle Carteris, a former star of \u201cBeverly Hills 90210\u201d and the union\u2019s president. \u201cWe have been talking about this for decades. Now it is time to commit to the process.\u201d Mr. Howard and Ms. Messing were among those gathered around a table in the dining room, which was lined with books on artists, including Ms. Widmaier-Picasso\u2019s grandfather. Dinner included red snapper and asparagus. For some, it was an evening to catch up with old friends. Mr. De Niro took out his iPhone to show Ms. Tomei a video of his youngest daughter playing tennis. \u201cShe looks just like you,\u201d he told her. Mr. Russell quizzed Mr. Howard about his new series on Albert Einstein, \u201cGenius.\u201d Peter Brant Jr., a son of the industrialist and art collector, talked with his brother Harry by the fireplace as Mr. Luhrmann extolled the virtues of spring in New York. \u201cPeople are on some adjusted chemical,\u201d he said. Ms. Widmaier-Picasso, an art historian, pointed to a wall-size photograph by Nobuyoshi Araki of a woman in bed, eyes closed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if she is sleeping, resting or just had an incredible orgasm,\u201d she said. \u201cI like it because it is mysterious. It stirs conversation.\u201d", "item_type": "Article", "abstract": "In Gramercy Park in Manhattan, a house full of Oscar and Emmy winners, including Robert De Niro, Jessica Lange, Julianne Moore and Ryan Murphy.", "created_date": "2017-04-20T15:33:10-04:00", "title": "A Hollywood Party at a Picasso Brownstone", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-19T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/fashion/hollywood-party-robert-de-niro-ryan-murphy-julianne-moore.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T15:33:10-04:00"}
