{"text": "OTTAWA \u2014 Turning the emotional page heading into a fresh playoff series would not take the Rangers long, Coach Alain Vigneault insisted before the puck dropped against the Ottawa Senators to start Round 2 on Thursday night. He said the new wave of verve had been detected \u201cprobably two practices ago.\u201d \u201cWe are focusing on what we needed to do against a really good team,\u201d Vigneault added. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for the challenge.\u201d If anyone would be ready for the Senators, it was goalie Henrik Lundqvist, who returned to sterling postseason form in the Rangers\u2019 gutsy six-game conquest of the Montreal Canadiens in the first round. Lundqvist had to be ready in the first 20 minutes, making 21 saves to keep the game scoreless. He stopped Erik Karlsson and his former teammate Derick Brassard three times and a host of Senators twice, many of his saves of the acrobatic and gymnastic variety. There was not much more Lundqvist could do short of trying to rush the puck up ice himself. But because he could not do that, it was Karlsson, Ottawa\u2019s best player, who was the hero of Game 1. He shot the puck at an impossible angle along the goal line, and it banked off Lundqvist into the net with 4 minutes 11 seconds left in the third period to give Ottawa the 2-1 victory. Ottawa goaltender Craig Anderson made 34 saves for the victory. Game 2 is Saturday. Lundqvist had 41 saves, helping the Rangers cling to a 1-0 lead until late in the second period. He carried over his dynamic performance from the Canadiens series, in which the Rangers forged three straight wins to advance. The speedy yet deliberate Senators, who finished with 4 fewer points than the Rangers but have home-ice advantage because the Rangers are a wild-card team, could not convert three early power-play chances. The Rangers scored first, at 7:10 of the second period, when Ryan McDonagh\u2019s shot from the point on the power play eluded Anderson. Mats Zuccarello and Pavel Buchnevich had assists. Then it was back to work for Lundqvist, who kept recording save after save before Ottawa\u2019s Ryan Dzingel knocked in a rebound on the power play at 18:39 of the second to tie the score. The atmosphere in Ottawa was a departure from what the Rangers experienced in the rabid and raucous Bell Centre against the Canadiens. The crowd chimed with the occasion choruses of \u201cGo, Sens, go,\u201d and fans enthusiastically waved their white playoff towels. As the game weaved its way through the third period, it was no surprise it was tight, considering the history between the clubs in recent years. All three previous games this season were decided by two or fewer goals, with Ottawa winning twice.
