{"text": "The Miami Marlins, one of the most forlorn franchises in baseball, are inching closer to being sold. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, said he was confident that he and his fellow investors, including the retired Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, would complete a deal to buy the team. Bush said he expected a resolution to their bid soon. \u201cGiven the interest that we have inside of Miami, and among people who are potential limited partners, I\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d Bush said when speaking at a conference on Tuesday in Los Angeles. Jeter and Bush have lined up Citibank to help them pay for the team, which is owned by Jeffrey Loria, a New York art dealer who has often conducted fire sales of expensive talent. The club is expected to sell for about $1.3 billion, but about $400 million of that amount is debt on the team. Bush, Jeter and their fellow investors would need to raise $800 million to $900 million to cover the rest. Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said recently that the Bush-Jeter group was not the only bidder for the Marlins, who have consistently ranked near the bottom of the major leagues in attendance and payroll. The other major bidder remaining is a group that includes Tagg Romney, the eldest son of Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012. Tagg Romney has worked in marketing at Reebok and with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Assuming it can complete the details of its financial plan to buy the team, the Bush-Jeter group is the favorite to win the bidding because of Jeter\u2019s prestige inside baseball and Bush\u2019s standing in Florida. \u201cThe team will be sold,\u201d said a person with knowledge of the process who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of when.\u201d If the Marlins are sold for $1.3 billion, it will represent the second-highest price paid for a major league team, after the $2 billion paid for the Dodgers in 2012. The Marlins\u2019 buyers could recoup some of their investment by selling the naming rights to the team\u2019s stadium, which could bring in several hundred million dollars. They could also restructure the team\u2019s media-rights deal.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/sports/baseball/miami-marlins-sale-jeb-bush-derek-jeter.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T18:50:30-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T18:50:30-04:00", "abstract": "Bush, the former governor of Florida, expressed confidence that his bid would be resolved soon.", "title": "Group Led by Jeb Bush and Derek Jeter Is Inching Closer to Buying the Marlins"}
