{"updated_date": "2017-04-19T11:57:59-04:00", "text": "\u201cBorn in China,\u201d another animals-are-just-like-people film from the Disneynature brand, has two of the natural world\u2019s more adorable creatures in it, pandas and kitties. But some scraggly looking antelopes provide the most impressive imagery in a film that otherwise doesn\u2019t stand out photographically. The movie takes us all over China to see four species in their natural habitats, some of which are exceedingly remote. There are kitties \u2014 oh, all right; they\u2019re snow leopards, a mother and two cubs. There\u2019s a panda and her cub. There\u2019s a young snub-nosed monkey that, at least in the irksome narrative imposed here, is feeling neglected because of the arrival of a baby sister. A Tibetan antelope, or chiru, doesn\u2019t get quite the screen time of these others \u2014 and isn\u2019t even mentioned in some of the advance publicity for the movie \u2014 but footage of a long migration by the females of a herd to a calving ground and the arrival of a calf is among the most remarkable in the movie. Maybe that\u2019s just because pandas and even the elusive snow leopard have become overexposed with the abundance of nature documentaries these days; this film looks pretty much like any of the best material to be found on the National Geographic Channel, PBS\u2019s \u201cNature\u201d and elsewhere. In any case, the narrative, read by John Krasinski, is kid-friendly in a cloying sort of way, and unpleasant realities like China\u2019s pollution are not mentioned. So as an introduction for children to exotic creatures in picturesque landscapes, the movie is harmless enough.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/movies/born-in-china-review.html", "section": "Movies", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "Disneynature\u2019s latest documentary visits remote parts of China to provide rare glimpses of young animals in the wild.", "title": "Review: In \u2018Born in China,\u2019 an Antelope Outshines a Panda", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T11:53:03-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "item_type": "Article"}
