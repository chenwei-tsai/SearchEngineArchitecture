{"text": "BERLIN \u2014 As twilight fell over Wedding, a working-class Berlin neighborhood, the curtained window panes of a small, dilapidated-looking backyard house began to glow. Yellow light spilled through the cracks in the wooden facade. Children playing next door looked up as the house started to vibrate, with musical notes and otherworldly feedback. Then came the strong, clear voice of the American civil rights icon Rosa Parks. She was talking about Montgomery, Ala., and her refusal to give up her seat in the front of a bus. Inside, Ryan Mendoza, a Berlin-based American artist, was putting on a half-hour-long sound performance, including excerpts from a 1957 radio interview conducted with Ms. Parks in this very building. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to keep the house alive,\u201d Mr. Mendoza explained. He has put on these sound performances, mixing music and spoken word, every evening since the house was opened to the public in early April. \u201cI try to make it loud enough to annoy the neighbors, but not too much.\u201d So far, the neighbors do not seem to be annoyed. On the contrary, Berlin has embraced the little house from Detroit, which Ms. Parks bought in 1957 and lived in with her brother\u2019s large family after fleeing death threats and employment problems in the South. After the house was scheduled for demolition in Detroit, its unlikely second life in Mr. Mendoza\u2019s garden in Berlin has captured the city\u2019s imagination, making front page news and, for some, symbolizing the changing role played by Germany in the world today. The project came about last year, when Rhea McCauley, Ms. Parks\u2019s niece, met Mr. Mendoza in Detroit. As part of an art project that explored his own sense of home, as well as the American subprime mortgage crisis, Mr. Mendoza successfully transported an abandoned house from Detroit to Europe, winning the trust of Detroit community members along the way. Ms. McCauley told him she had managed to buy back the family house for $500, but she could not find anyone interested in saving it from demolition. Mr. Mendoza, who makes his living as a fine-arts painter, agreed to help. He raised a little over $100,000 by selling some of his paintings and set out for Detroit. There, he worked with a local team to take apart the house, which had fallen into extreme disrepair. He then shipped the wooden exterior to Berlin, where he spent the winter painstakingly rebuilding it, mostly alone, by hand. \u201cIt was an act of love,\u201d he said. That the house had to be shipped to Berlin to be saved is shocking, said Daniel Geary, a professor of American history at Trinity College Dublin, given that, \u201cin general, in the U.S., with public heroes, there is an attempt to preserve anywhere they lived.\u201d Mr. Geary said that, to him, the neglect of a house like this one speaks to a contemporary American unwillingness to deal with racism\u2019s legacy. \u201cPeople like to remember Rosa Parks for one moment, when she wouldn\u2019t stand up on a bus,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t really want to grapple with the rest of her life. The death threats, the fact that she had to leave Alabama and go to Detroit. It\u2019s a more complicated story with a less happy ending. She suffered for her decision.\u201d For many here, Germany provides a strong counterexample when it comes to approaching painful aspects of a nation\u2019s past. \u201cWith our history, we have so many years of guilt and a culture of practicing not forgetting,\u201d said Deike Diening, a journalist for Berlin\u2019s Tagesspiegel newspaper, who wrote about the project. \u201cGermans are glad for the opportunity to put lessons learned to use with this house: Now, it might be a healing process to be able to turn it around, to give refuge to others. It feels good.\u201d But some said it was the timing of the project that accounted for its extraordinary resonance. \u201cI think Berliners, even more than Germans in general, are really deeply concerned about what is going on in the U.S., with Trump,\u201d said Gero Schliess, culture correspondent at Deutsche Welle, Germany\u2019s international broadcast service. The United States has long been a model. But now, he said, \u201cthe political discourse in the U.S. is not really reflecting democratic values.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to have the house here,\u201d said Mr. Mendoza\u2019s wife, Fabia Mendoza, who grew up in Berlin and has made a documentary about the project. The couple, who have a young son, live in a small, white cube-shaped house right next to the newly erected clapboard one. They hope that their garden will ultimately be a temporary haven and that the house will eventually find a more permanent home. For now, Ms. McCauley, Ms. Parks\u2019s niece, is very happy the house is in Germany, tucked away snugly behind a 1960s-era apartment building. Traveling to Berlin for the unveiling on April 8, Ms. McCauley was impressed with what she described as the outpouring of love she encountered. \u201cI was amazed to find more knowledge of Auntie Rosa\u2019s legacy there than here,\u201d she said. Ms. McCauley was also pleased with Mr. Mendoza\u2019s decision to leave the facade in the condition he found it. \u201cThis house has been through everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s not painted nicely, with flowers and a picket fence. We\u2019re not talking about a fairy tale, there\u2019s no Hansel and Gretel here. We\u2019re talking about a lady who sacrificed so much, who suffered.\u201d Mr. Mendoza has listed a series of opening hours \u2014 during which the couple welcome the public to their garden, often with live music and an open mike \u2014 on his website. However, some 50 people ring their bell each day, Mr. Mendoza said. If the couple are at home, they usually let them in. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a little worried,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut it\u2019s O.K. This was an act of love, and we want to start a discussion.\u201d The house is partly visible from the street, so people can get a glimpse of it even if the Mendozas are not at home. Visitors are not allowed inside the house, for insurance reasons, but also as a sign of respect. \u201cThis house was abandoned, people came inside,\u201d Mr. Mendoza said. \u201cI want it to have its dignity.\u201d On a recent Saturday, a dozen visitors dropped in. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal that it\u2019s here,\u201d said Norberto Romero, a photographer who lives in the neighborhood. \u201cIt\u2019s strange no one wants it in the U.S.,\u201d said another visitor, Marcus Kelch, who works with handicapped children, and looked up Rosa Parks on the internet to find out who she was. His friend Dennis Lumme nodded. \u201cIn Germany, it\u2019s different. I just read that in the Ravensbr\u00fcck women\u2019s concentration camp, people want to make a monument for lesbians who were killed. We try to memorialize every group that suffered.\u201d The friends were silent, as they considered the transplanted house\u2019s peeling paint and battered wooden boards. \u201cBerlin is definitely the right place for this house,\u201d Mr. Lumme said after a moment. \u201cEvery meter you walk is full of memory.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/europe/rosa-parks-house-berlin.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T09:40:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T09:40:07-04:00", "abstract": "When no one in Detroit stepped up to save the civil rights pioneer\u2019s home, an artist disassembled it and shipped it to his garden in Berlin.", "title": "Saved From Demolition, Rosa Parks\u2019s House Gets a Second Life"}
