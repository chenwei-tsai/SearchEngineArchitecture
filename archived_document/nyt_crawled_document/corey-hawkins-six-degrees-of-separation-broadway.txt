Hero. Swindler. Corey Hawkins Changes It Up.", "material_type_facet": "News", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "In one of the best scenes from the N.W.A biopic \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d Dr. Dre instructs Eazy-E, struggling in the recording booth: \u201cSay that [expletive] like you believe it, man!\u201d Corey Hawkins, who played Dr. Dre, takes that piece of advice to heart in his current project, a Broadway revival of \u201cSix Degrees of Separation.\u201d His character, Paul, is a suave swindler pretending to be Sidney Poitier\u2019s son so he can worm his way into genteel families. But no matter how outrageous the fibs, Mr. Hawkins makes him sound utterly sincere. \u201cI guess I lean into the honesty and the innocence of Paul a little bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cHe truly believes these cons.\u201d Trip Cullman, who\u2019s directing the new production of John Guare\u2019s 1990 drama at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, concurred. \u201cThat to me is the great secret weapon that Corey brings to his portrayal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do feel that Paul is telling the truth.\u201d And thanks to Mr. Hawkins\u2019s easygoing charm, Paul is able to hoodwink both the other characters and the audience. Since his breakout role in \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d Mr. Hawkins has added a new shine to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: He landed the lead on Fox\u2019s \u201c24: Legacy,\u201d the network\u2019s reboot of its \u201c24\u201d franchise, and appeared as a geologist in \u201cKong: Skull Island.\u201d Eagle-eyed fans would also know him from a recurring role as the bespectacled supply-runner Heath on \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d Looking dapper in crisp denim, white sneakers and a black baseball cap on a recent spring morning, Mr. Hawkins, 28, exuded an upbeat forthrightness. While many actors\u2019 smiles stop at the mouth, his actually reached his almond-shaped eyes. This is someone you would buy a bridge from, making his current character\u2019s seductive powers all the more credible \u2014 you want to believe, too. Mr. Hawkins now has the kind of fame that earns him a front-row seat at Paris Fashion Week \u2014 he sounded simultaneously giddy and incredulous talking about the invite \u2014 and it was earned via screens big and small. But \u201cSix Degrees of Separation,\u201d in which he shares top billing with Allison Janney and John Benjamin Hickey, brings him back to his first love, theater. The show also returns him to Mr. Guare, whose 1971 play \u201cThe House of Blue Leaves\u201d he did at Juilliard. \u201cI had one line, and it was the bane of my existence because I was so nervous about it,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said, recalling that then as now, Mr. Guare hovered backstage. Growing up in Washington, Mr. Hawkins was shaped by the combined influence of his mother, a police officer, a storytelling grandmother and a great-grandmother who preached in her own church. \u201cThere\u2019s something about a pastor getting up there and telling these stories, especially in the Baptist church because it\u2019s so fervid,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cYou\u2019re just: \u2018Oh my God, Jesus did what? The disciples did what?\u2019 You see people fainting and catching the spirit. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always believed in, that collective energy. It\u2019s sort of what you\u2019re doing when you watch theater: You\u2019re allowing yourself to disappear into that, and submit to that, and have faith that this show is going to take you where it needs to take you.\u201d After high school, Mr. Hawkins attended California Institute of the Arts for a year before transferring to Juilliard. \u201cI was told I would turn into this classically trained robot, but I wanted to add to my toolbox,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember bringing a scene from \u2018Macbeth\u2019 to class, and Michael Kahn, who used to be the head of the drama division, ripped it to shreds. I set up lights in the staircase \u2014 I was trying to put on a performance instead of doing the scene \u2014 and he showed me the truth in playing the language and hearing the musicality.\u201d In 2010, Mr. Hawkins won the school\u2019s John Houseman Prize for excellence in classical acting, and three years later he made his Broadway debut as Tybalt in \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d \u2014 not the worst practice for the N.W.A rhymes to come. Like Dr. Dre, with whom he spent a lot of time before and during the film shoot, Mr. Hawkins is a hard-working perfectionist who\u2019s keenly aware of what he\u2019s up against. \u201cAs young black men, young black people in general in this country, I was always told at a very young age that you have to work 10 percent harder than everyone else,\u201d he said, then immediately corrected himself: \u201cNot even 10 percent: 50 percent, 100 percent more than everyone else just to be seen as good enough, good as every other person. And that\u2019s something that I found to be very true.\u201d The trick is to make that effort disappear onstage, so only spontaneity, or the perfect illusion thereof, remains. \u201cHe knows that he\u2019s good at what he\u2019s doing, and he doesn\u2019t have to try too hard,\u201d said Ms. Janney (who, like Mr. Hickey, seems to have developed a heartfelt fondness for her young co-star). Mr. Hawkins is very aware of issues of lineage, citing as inspiration Mr. Poitier himself, along with Denzel Washington, Samuel L. Jackson and a pair of previous Pauls: Courtney B. Vance, who created the part on Broadway, and Will Smith, who did the movie version. But he also brings up an influence that\u2019s perhaps less obvious. \u201cI steal from Meryl Streep a lot,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about people who have a quiet intensity, and I think she has that quality in life, too.\u201d (He said that of Dr. Dre as well, making him the rare actor to mention these two pop-culture titans in the same breath.) Mr. Hawkins\u2019s plans beyond his Broadway run are fuzzy \u2014 he won\u2019t learn until May whether \u201c24: Legacy\u201d is getting a second season. One thing he does know is that he\u2019d love to return to music. He was in early productions of the show \u201cPiece of My Heart,\u201d about the songwriter Bert Berns (his big number was \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d), and did a lot of his own rapping in \u201cCompton.\u201d Now, he wouldn\u2019t mind another bio-musical \u2014 about Sam Cooke. \u201cIt is literally a dream of mine to make that happen,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cI want to do it so badly.\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
