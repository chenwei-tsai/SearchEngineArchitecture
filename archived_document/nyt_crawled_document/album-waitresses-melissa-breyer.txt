{"text": "Melissa Breyer moved to New York to become a painter and ended up becoming a waitress, first at a pasta place in Greenwich Village, then at a bar and grill in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She enjoyed the social aspect of the work, but especially the quiet moments, when she could daydream \u201cabout the books I was reading or conversations I wanted to have or shoes I would like,\u201d she said. \u201cThings I wanted to do, places I wanted to go.\u201d As she made the transition to photographer, writer and website editor, she found herself drawn to the stories playing out behind the windows of the restaurants she passed. The waitresses, especially, caught her attention. When they weren\u2019t reciting the nightly specials or balancing dinner for four on one arm, what were they thinking? The photographs here, taken from either side of the restaurant window, ask this question without trying to answer it. \u201cThey all have lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have a place where they live and have histories. When they\u2019re paused in reverie, that\u2019s the entry point for where the stories begin. I make up narratives for them sometimes. Maybe one of them is practicing to be a Rockette. There\u2019re so many possibilities. This is a city of eight and a half million separate films. Each person is a film. I say, \u2018Here\u2019s the star of a story.\u2019\u201d If the waitresses shown are like their photographer, one thing they were not thinking about was how to tell the big tippers from the cheapskates, Ms. Breyer said. \u201cI never made an effort to figure that out,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthe best thing is when you\u2019re completely surprised.\u201d She did, however develop a condition common among former servers, she said. \u201cI\u2019m guilty of extravagant tipping, even if the service is terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI just say, \u2018Maybe they\u2019re having a bad day.\u2019\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/album-waitresses-melissa-breyer.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T07:00:11-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T07:00:11-04:00", "abstract": "The photographer Melissa Breyer found herself drawn to the stories playing out behind the windows of restaurants.", "title": "The \u2018Quiet Moments\u2019 of Waitresses at Work"}
