The surprising images were taken on Sunday as tensions between the United States and North Korea seemed to spike. The Korean Peninsula pulsed with news that the North was preparing for its sixth atomic detonation and that American warships had been ordered into the Sea of Japan as a deterrent, even though the ships turned out to have sailed in the opposite direction. The volleyball games, played in the middle of that international crisis, were probably intended to send a message, analysts said, as the North Koreans are aware that the nuclear test site is under intense scrutiny. But what meaning the North wanted the games to convey is unclear. \u201cIt suggests that the facility might be going into a standby mode,\u201d Joseph Bermudez told reporters on a conference call organized by 38 North, a research institute at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cIt also suggests that these volleyball games are being conducted with the North Koreans knowing that we\u2019ll be looking and reporting on it.\u201d Mr. Bermudez, a veteran North Korean analyst, emphasized the ambiguity of North Korean intentions. \u201cThey\u2019re either sending us a message that they\u2019ve put the facility on standby, or they\u2019re trying to deceive us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know.\u201d At a military parade on Saturday, Pyongyang displayed many missiles, and on Sunday, it fired one that exploded seconds after liftoff, raising suspicions that an American program to sabotage the test flights had struck once again. But at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, in the mountainous wilds of the North, teams of players that Sunday were engaged in a series of volleyball games, according to the image analysts. The game locations, Mr. Bermudez said, were the main administrative area, the guard barracks and the support area of the command center. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cis somewhat unusual.\u201d The resolution, or sharpness, of the satellite images was such that the players looked quite small, with no discernible features. Mr. Bermudez spoke with reporters on Tuesday, and the group on Wednesday put out a report on the test-site developments. The authors, along with Mr. Bermudez, were Jack Liu and Frank Pabian, a scientist at the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico, the birthplace of the atomic bomb. The report said the volleyball teams appeared to be \u201cthe normal six players on each side.\u201d An additional image in the report showed what the analysts identified as a \u201cpossible volleyball net\u201d near the command area. But no players were visible. Volleyball is a popular sport in North Korea, and satellite imagery often identifies games in progress. Previous images of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site have revealed personnel playing volleyball, but never before in three concurrent games. Mr. Bermudez is an adviser to AllSource Analysis, a Colorado company that analyzes satellite images and other information for government and commercial clients. The 38 North report said that the rugged test site, despite the games, appeared able to conduct a sixth nuclear test at any time upon receiving the order.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test-volleyball.html", "section": "World"}
