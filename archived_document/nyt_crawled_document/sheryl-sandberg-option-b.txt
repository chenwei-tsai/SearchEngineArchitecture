Knopf. $25.95. You could almost hear the collective gasp when news broke, in May 2015, that the internet entrepreneur Dave Goldberg had died suddenly while on vacation in Mexico with his wife, Sheryl Sandberg. Their marriage had become a public one ever since the publication, two years earlier, of \u201cLean In,\u201d her book about women and leadership. In it she had written some revolutionary things about marriage (she called it having a \u201cpartner,\u201d but the book was so much about redefining gender roles that she clearly seemed to be talking about husbands). Deciding to get married \u2014 and the choice of whom to marry \u2014 weren\u2019t just central to one\u2019s private life, she wrote. Together they made up the \u201cmost important career decision that a woman makes.\u201d She observed that most women at the top aren\u2019t the lonely, single women of clich\u00e9s; they are married women whose husbands support their ambitions and take equal responsibility for making a home. She said that her great success (she is the chief operating officer of Facebook, which has made her a billionaire) would have been impossible without the unwavering support of her husband. Now, in the cruelest way, she had lost him. \u201cLean In\u201d sparked a movement, but it had its critics, among them single mothers, women who worked outside corporate America, and those who could not afford to hire the nannies and helpers upon whom the Sandberg-Goldberg household clearly depended. There were also those who thought the principal value underlying the book was flawed. They didn\u2019t want to find ways to make their work more exhilarating; they wanted to find ways to accommodate it to their lives as parents. The tragedy was a vicious reminder of the truth we work hard to forget: Life is cruel. It will casually take away the people we love the most. Even the vaunted \u201cC-suite\u201d job is cold comfort when it cost you hours with a lost loved one. Now, two years after Goldberg\u2019s death, Sandberg has written a new book, \u201cOption B,\u201d which forthrightly addresses all of these issues. It is a remarkable achievement: generous, honest, almost unbearably poignant. It reveals an aspect of Sandberg\u2019s character that \u201cLean In\u201d had suggested but \u2014 because of the elitism at its center \u2014 did not fully demonstrate: her impulse to be helpful. She has little to gain by sharing, in excruciating detail, the events of her life over the past two years. This is a book that will be quietly passed from hand to hand, and it will surely offer great comfort to its intended readers. \u201cI have terrible news,\u201d she told her children, after flying home from Mexico. \u201cDaddy died.\u201d The intimacy of detail that fills the book is unsettling; there were times I felt that I had come across someone\u2019s secret knowledge, that I shouldn\u2019t have been in possession of something that seemed so deeply private. But the candor and simplicity with which she shares all of it \u2014 including her children\u2019s falling to the ground, unable to walk to the grave when they arrive at the cemetery \u2014 is a kind of gift. She was shielded from the financial disaster that often accompanies sudden widowhood, but in every other way she was unprotected from great pain. As she did in the memorable Facebook post composed a month after the death, she reports turning in her misery to the psychologist Adam Grant, a friend who had flown to California to attend the funeral and is an expert in the field of human resilience. She told him that her greatest fear was that her children would never be happy again. He \u201cwalked me through the data,\u201d she writes, and what she learns offers comfort. Getting \u201cwalked through the data,\u201d is as modern a response to grief as the notion that \u201cresilience\u201d is some kind of science. The book includes several illustrative stories that seem to come from Grant\u2019s research, but they are not memorable. It is Sandberg whose story commands our riveted attention, and it is her natural and untutored responses to the horror that are most moving. \u201cThis is the second worst moment of our lives,\u201d she tells her sobbing children at the cemetery. \u201cWe lived through the first and we will live through this. It can only get better from here.\u201d That is grief: Somehow, you find a language; somehow you get through it. No research could have helped her in that moment. She is the one who knew what to do and what to say. They were her children, and she knew how to comfort them. Death humbles each of us in different ways. Suddenly a single mother, Sandberg realized how hollow her \u201cLean In\u201d chapter about the importance of fully involved husbands (\u201cpartners\u201d) must have been to unmarried women. If only she had known how little time she would have with her husband, she thinks, she would have spent more of it with him. But that\u2019s not the way life works; Dave Goldberg fell in love with a woman who wanted to lead, not one who wanted to wait for him to come home from the office. The unbearable clarity that follows a death blessedly fades with time. We couldn\u2019t live with it every day. Sheryl Sandberg followed the oldest data set in the world, the one that says: The children are young, and you must keep going. Slowly the fog began to lift. She found she had something useful to offer at a meeting; she got the children through their first birthdays without their father; she began to have one O.K. day and then another. She made it through a year, all of the \u201cmilestone days\u201d had passed and something began to revive within her. Grief is the final act of love, and recovery from it is the necessary betrayal on which the future depends. There is only this one life, and we are the ones who are here to live it."}
