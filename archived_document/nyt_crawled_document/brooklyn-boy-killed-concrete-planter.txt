{"text": "An 8-year-old boy climbing on a window in the front yard of his Brooklyn home was killed on Thursday afternoon when a concrete planter attached to the house fell on him, the authorities said. The boy, Kevin Reilly, was scaling the metal security bars on a ground-floor window about 5:25 p.m. when he apparently reached for one of the two heavy, rectangular flower boxes that were directly above the window. The planter, which rested on small bricks jutting out between the ground and first floors, tumbled on top of him, the police said. Officers responded to a 911 call at the house in the Marine Park neighborhood and found the boy unresponsive and with head trauma, the police said. He was taken to Coney Island Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. For hours afterward, a group of neighbors gathered near the boy\u2019s home and expressed disbelief about the accident. They wondered whether the boy\u2019s relatives, who they say moved into the two-story home last year, were aware of the potential danger of concrete flower boxes, a feature of many homes on the 2000 block of Ryder Street. One neighbor, Anthony Terranova, said he had lived on the street for more than 30 years and had never seen a similar instance. \u201cEverybody knows each other,\u201d said Mr. Terranova, 64, a retired employee of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. \u201cWe watch out for each other.\u201d After the accident, workers with the city\u2019s Department of Buildings, which conducts inspections and investigations, were seen in the front yard looking at the boy\u2019s home. The two planters, each several feet long, were resting in the grass.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/brooklyn-boy-killed-concrete-planter.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T23:16:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T23:16:10-04:00", "abstract": "An 8-year-old climbing the security gates on a window in Marine Park apparently grabbed the flower box, which fell on him, the police said.", "title": "Boy Killed as Concrete Planter Falls on Him Outside Brooklyn Home"}
