{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cChina\u2019s Appetite Pushes Fish Stocks to Brink\u201d (front page, April 30): Few better examples cry out for effective decision-making \u2014 and the forums in which to make and enforce those decisions \u2014 than overfishing. Fully 90 percent of the world\u2019s fisheries are exploited or facing collapse; the consequences for food security, economic well-being and political stability are catastrophic. The United States has made progress, in its waters, because the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration regulates fishing and, often with the cooperation of local fishermen, takes action to limit the catch where overfishing is occurring. As a result, the stock increases, and there is more fish for everyone. On a global level, an organization to perform that role, with the cooperation of governments, is critical. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization could do the job if it is properly charged, receives the support of the entire body and is sufficiently funded to perform those duties. LINDA STAMATONEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. The writer is co-director of the Center for Negotiation and Conflict Resolution, Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. To the Editor: It is not only China\u2019s appetite for fish, but also our own appetite for Chinese-caught fish that is contributing to the depletion of worldwide fish stocks. I have been dismayed for several years that much of the frozen fish available at the supermarket is labeled \u201cproduct of China.\u201d The Chinese state subsidizes the overfishing, and we are subsidizing the whole works by buying the product.
