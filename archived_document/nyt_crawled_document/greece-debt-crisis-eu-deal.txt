{"text": "TOKYO \u2014 A Greek official said on Tuesday that his country had reached a deal with its creditors that would allow it to receive critical emergency funds in return for promises to raise taxes and cut social spending. The agreement, the culmination of six months of talks between Greece, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, was seen as essential to avoid a fiscal meltdown in Athens, where the government faces a 7 billion euro, or about $7.6 billion, debt repayment in July. Under the agreement, Greece will make changes to its labor and energy markets, cut pension payouts and increase taxes, Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, told reporters, according to Reuters. \u201cThere was white smoke,\u201d Mr. Tsakalotos was quoted as saying, alluding to the method used by the Vatican to signal an agreement in the selection of a new pope. The Athens News Agency quoted him in a similar way. \u201cThe way has now been paved for debt relief talks,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. Further discussions will include ways of decreasing Greece\u2019s debt.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/business/greece-debt-crisis-eu-deal.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T00:38:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T00:38:16-04:00", "abstract": "The Greek finance minister said the deal would allow his country to receive critical emergency funds in exchange for promises of higher taxes and lower social spending.", "title": "Greek Official Says Deal Reached With E.U. on Bailout Overhauls"}
