{"text": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 At some point, most young basketball players come to realize that success is measured by more than what prestigious conference they play in or what big-time program they suit up for. There is a lot to be said for happiness. Ask Joe Rahon. A 6-foot-2 junior guard, he had 10 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists on Saturday night as St. Mary\u2019s defeated Loyola Marymount here in the quarterfinals of the West Coast Conference\u2019s tournament. Coming out of high school in San Diego, Rahon envisioned having that kind of performance at the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, before a huge, rabid crowd. It was a dream that prompted Rahon to fly across the country to play under Steve Donahue at Boston College. It\u2019s a miscalculation made each year by na\u00efve 18-year-old recruits, attracted by the image of the big conferences, with their glamorous head coaches and phenomenal facilities. \u201cI was going to be a building block of the program,\u201d Rahon said Saturday, recalling that he had looked forward to playing at Duke, at North Carolina, against Syracuse at the Carrier Dome. After two years at Boston College, though, Rahon had had enough \u2014 enough of the losing, enough of the futility. In his sophomore season, 2013-14, Boston College finished 8-24, its worst record since joining the A.C.C. in 2005. Donahue was fired with two years left on his contract. \u201cAfter two years, the competitor in me was saying, \u2018This is really cool, but I want to win,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Rahon said. He headed to St. Mary\u2019s and sat out the 2014-2015 season because of the N.C.A.A.\u2019s transfer rules, an agonizing exercise but one that enabled Rahon time to acclimate to the West Coast and adjust to his new situation. There would be trade-offs. \u201cYou\u2019re playing smaller gyms, fewer people in the crowd,\u201d Rahon said, \u201cbut when you\u2019re playing for a championship and you\u2019re playing games that are really meaningful, into late February and early March, it kind of makes up for the big arenas and atmosphere that you get in the A.C.C.\u201d I enjoy the midmajor conference tournaments, including the W.C.C.\u2019s. They are defined by a sense of hope that gives March Madness its high-wire excitement. In recent years, though, income inequality in sports \u2014 supposedly the epitome of a level playing field \u2014 has become discouraging. Again and again, with a few exceptions, the hope that the conference tournaments inevitably engender has met a swift end in the N.C.A.A. tournament. I have become obsessed with the idea of creating March Madness parity to consistently allow the great midmajor basketball teams in any given year to reach the N.C.A.A. tournament\u2019s Final Four. I envision parallel tournaments, one made up of midmajors and one of programs from the so-called Power Five conferences. The top two teams in each tournament would meet in a reconfigured Final Four. I shared my vision with the W.C.C.\u2019s commissioner, Lynn Holzman, who knows, as I do, that such an arrangement is impossible but also knows that there must be a change in the landscape. Still, for all of the inequities of the current system, Holzman likes the long-shot nature of the N.C.A.A. tournament, which makes midmajors perennial underdogs. \u201cI still think there is something magical about the field of 68 and playing in the N.C.A.A. championship,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re obsessed with the Cinderella story and the possibility that the 16th seed is going to beat the No. 1 seed.\u201d Provided they avoid upsets on Monday, St. Mary\u2019s and Gonzaga will play on Tuesday for the W.C.C. tournament title. Each team appears to be on the bubble for making the N.C.A.A. tournament and may need the conference\u2019s automatic bid to prolong its season. Gonzaga has the added pressure of trying to extend its streak of consecutive N.C.A.A. tournament appearances to 18. Regardless of which team moves on, though, it will be an underdog once the N.C.A.A. tournament begins next week. \u201cSome might say that Gonzaga is no longer a Cinderella story, but I think it still is,\u201d Holzman said. \u201cWhen you look at how many midmajors actually get to the Final Four, it\u2019s rare.\u201d David Carter, a St. Mary\u2019s assistant and a former head coach at Nevada, was on the 1988-89 St. Mary\u2019s team that reached the N.C.A.A. tournament but lost to Clemson in its opener. For Carter, the difference between that year and this one is exposure. In 1989, there was little opportunity for fans across the country to be exposed to conferences like the W.C.C. \u201cYou were more amped up to see what you could do,\u201d Carter said of playing as a midmajor in the national tournament. \u201cIt was more of a David-and-Goliath approach to the tournament because people across the county never saw you play.\u201d Today, programs at every level get exposure. Even high school teams get exposure. \u201cYou\u2019re on television quite a bit,\u201d Carter said. \u201cYou have parity in basketball. Teams in the West Coast Conference feel they can play against anyone in the country.\u201d Carter said that in his playing days, players at midmajors who did not have much experience against the nation\u2019s top teams always had doubts. \u201cYou weren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re good enough,\u201d Carter said, describing their attitude as \u201clet\u2019s go prove ourselves.\u201d \u201cBut now,\u201d Carter added, \u201cI think people see you, see your team and see how good you are, so it\u2019s not a big surprise when you beat a team from a big-five conference.\u201d The Power Five conferences still attract the top players, and recruits like Rahon will invariably pick one of those teams over a midmajor. Many, though, will eventually transfer. At that point, it\u2019s no longer about getting to the N.B.A. but about enjoying the experience \u2014 winning a regular-season title or a conference tournament championship and taking your shot in the N.C.A.A. tournament. It\u2019s about feeling productive. \u201cI wanted to win,\u201d Rahon said. \u201cI wanted a chance to make the tournament, a chance to play for a league championship. Everything I came here for is kind of coming to fruition.\u201d I have watched hundreds of young talented players spend a lifetime pursuing manufactured goals. The luckiest among them realize, as Rahon has, that success is not always measured by the destination but by the quality of the journey.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/sports/ncaa-tournament-st-marys-and-gonzaga.html", "published_date": "2016-03-05T19:00:00-05:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T04:00:09-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T04:00:09-04:00", "abstract": "Provided they avoid upsets on Monday, St. Mary\u2019s and Gonzaga appear close to making the N.C.A.A. tournament and may need the conference\u2019s automatic bid to prolong its season.", "title": "On the Bubble for Making N.C.A.A.
