{"text": "The success of a first-round N.F.L. draft pick will eventually be known; it just might take a few years. But who wants to wait? Less than 24 hours after the first round was completed, everyone with a keyboard and an opinion was already grading the picks, sometimes pretty harshly. We took a look at six of the more reputable assessors \u2014 Sports Illustrated, CBS, Fox, SBNation, Bleacher Report and the draft site Walter Football \u2014 to see which teams \u201cwon\u201d or \u201clost\u201d the draft, before any of the picks has even put on pro shoulder pads. Garrett, a defensive end from Texas A&M, got a thumbs up from the panel, defying the Cleveland Browns\u2019 reputation for making bad selections. The Browns\u2019 pick got two A-pluses, three A\u2019s and a B-plus, for a grade-point average of 3.98. As Benjamin Hoffman put it in The New York Times: \u201cVirtually everyone else who watched him star for the Aggies thinks he can dominate in the N.F.L. He is this draft\u2019s closest approximation of a sure thing.\u201d Concerns about injuries and big-play ability, and criticism by Warren Sapp, do not seem to have altered the consensus. The Browns got it right for once. On the other hand ... The selection of the quarterback from North Carolina was met with an extended Bronx cheer. The Chicago Bears picked up a C and three D\u2019s. Walter Football did not give the pick a grade, but wrote, \u201cThis is one of the worst draft moves ever made\u201d and called it a \u201cfranchise-ruining selection.\u201d Let\u2019s call that an F. There was dismay that the Bears had sent picks to the San Francisco 49ers just to move up one notch in the draft. There was puzzlement over why the team just paid Mike Glennon a lot of money to be its quarterback. There was concern over Trubisky\u2019s brief career \u2014 just one full season \u2014 as a starter in college. \u201cTen years from now, every Bears fan will still be talking about Thursday night and that jaw-dropping moment this football-crazed city will never forget, \u201d The Chicago Tribune wrote. There was one exception. Dieter Kurtenbach of Fox rated the pick an A-minus. Combined with the less positive grades, the G.P.A. is 1.45. Now Trubisky has to prove almost everyone wrong. Now here was a pick everyone could get behind. Four A-pluses and two A\u2019s for the choice of the defensive lineman from Stanford. Average: 4.20, the highest of the round. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy pick and the right one,\u201d Fox said. Several graders gave bonus points to the 49ers for fleecing the Bears out of those extra picks. Hoffman in The Times pointed out: \u201cHe will likely be asked to play tackle in the N.F.L., which may require adding some bulk to his athletic frame.\u201d Sometimes the consensus is good. Sometimes it\u2019s bad. Sometimes there is no consensus. Most graders felt that Fournette of L.S.U. was the best running back available, and maybe the best player. Hoffman wrote, \u201cHe is a throwback to the power runners of yesteryear.\u201d But do you really take an old-school running back this high? And is any Jags running back going to succeed with the team\u2019s poor offensive line? The grades for the pick ranged from A-minus to D, with an average of 2.72. The wide receiver from Western Michigan was greeted with a respectful, if not gushing, thumbs up. \u201cThe most pro-ready receiver in this class,\u201d Sports Illustrated said. But some felt the Tennessee Titans had more pressing needs. Grade average: 2.90. The biggest cheers of the rest of the first round went to these four selections: Marshon Lattimore, New Orleans Saints: \u201cA coup,\u201d SBNation said. Malik Hooker, Indianapolis Colts: \u201cCould be one of the top safeties in the N.F.L.,\u201d Walter Football said. Jonathan Allen, Washington Redskins: \u201cA steal,\u201d The Times said. O.J. Howard, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: \u201cPerfect for the modern N.F.L.,\u201d Sports Illustrated said. But topping the list (after the No. 3 pick Thomas) with a 4.03 grade point average \u2014 three A-pluses, two A\u2019s and a B-plus \u2014 was the choice of Reuben Foster at No. 31 by the 49ers. He was the top linebacker in the nation last year, and \u201ca potential centerpiece for an N.F.L. defense,\u201d according to Hoffman. But his stock plunged after an altercation with a hospital worker at the scouting combine. The graders felt that picking up a player of his caliber so low in the first round was a steal. G.P.A.: 4.03 Nobody got as bad a score as Trubisky, but two were close: Some spoke highly of quarterback Patrick Mahomes, but felt the Kansas City Chiefs should not have given up a package that included a first rounder next year to get him. The last pick of the round, Ryan Ramczyk by the Saints, puzzled graders, who noted that the Saints are not in need of a tackle. Both graded at 2.15. Perhaps the highest-profile player in the draft was Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson, who went at No. 12 to the Houston Texans. The pick was divisive. Fox gave it an A \u2014 \u201cWatson fills a massive need\u201d \u2014 but CBS went with a C-minus, faulting how much Houston gave up to move up in the draft. The Giants\u2019 pick at No. 23, tight end Evan Engram, got an A-minus from Bleacher Report \u2014 \u201cGiants fans haven\u2019t seen the likes of him since Jeremy Shockey\u201d \u2014 but a D-minus from Fox: \u201cEngram cannot block.\u201d Perhaps the hardest pick to assess was cornerback Gareon Conley by the Oakland Raiders. Conley faces a sexual-assault allegation, though he has yet to be charged and has denied the accusation. Two graders rated the pick incomplete, another gave it both an A and an F. Even for veteran draft-watchers, it\u2019s hard to say what Conley\u2019s future will hold.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/nfl-draft-round-1-grades.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T10:24:38-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T10:24:38-04:00", "abstract": "It could take a few years to know the true success of the draft picks, but some grades came in less than 24 hours after the first round was over.", "title": "N.F.L.
