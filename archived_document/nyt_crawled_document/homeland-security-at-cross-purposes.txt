{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cFearmongering at Homeland Security\u201d (editorial, April 21): For all his harsh rhetoric, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly is actually undermining public safety by enabling the very criminals whom law enforcement agencies, including the one I run, are trying to get off the streets. Every year, the New York City Department of Investigation arrests hundreds of people, many of whom run dangerous building sites that put workers and the public in danger or participate in gang shootings that target some of our poorest citizens. The witnesses to these crimes, and many others, are often undocumented workers. Mr. Kelly\u2019s rhetoric, which pushes these workers into the shadows and away from talking to law enforcement, is unhelpful. Keeping all Americans safe should be the prime objective of all law enforcement. Mr. Kelly needs to work with us on this goal, not at cross purposes. MARK G.
