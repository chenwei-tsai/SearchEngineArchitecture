{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Across France, large May Day rallies reflected the country\u2019s ideological divisions. Organized labor has traditionally opposed Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front, but major unions oppose the job-market overhauls that Emmanuel Macron, the centrist who leads in polls, wants to expand if elected. Both candidates condemned violent clashes in Paris. Mr. Macron paid tribute to a Moroccan man who was killed in 1995 on the fringes of a National Front rally. And some noted that Ms. Len appeared to have copied parts of her speech on Monday from a former rival. Our Interpreter columnists explore how the midcentury Algerian War led to a crisis of identity that is still playing out in the presidential election. _____ \u2022 Here\u2019s how International Labor Day unfolded around the world. On the sidelines of a parade in St. Petersburg, the Russian police detained about 20 gay rights protesters, above. In Hungary, thousands rallied against the government\u2019s alignment with Russia. More than 70 protesters were detained in Istanbul, where some tried to defy restrictions on gathering at the symbolic Taksim Square. And in the U.S., thousands protested against Mr. Trump and for workers\u2019 and immigrants\u2019 rights, despite his effort to rebrand May 1 \u201cLoyalty Day.\u201d _____ \u2022 President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign debuted a triumphant TV ad celebrating his first 100 days as a success. (We fact-checked the ad.) But Mr. Trump had a bit of media trouble. He cut an interview short after a reporter questioned his unsubstantiated claims that his campaign was wiretapped. Separately, he also questioned whether the American Civil War was necessary. Mr. Trump also said he would be \u201chonored\u201d to meet with  North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, \u201cunder the right circumstances.\u201d The comment only goes to illustrate Mr. Trump\u2019s confidence in his own deal-making abilities, our White House correspondent writes. _____ \u2022 Hamas is trying to present a more moderate public face. The militant group says it is open to a Palestinian state along 1967 lines, wants closer ties with Egypt and is watering down anti-Jewish language. Analysts see it as a tack to counter its political rival, the Palestinian Authority, days before its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, meets President Trump. _____ \u2022 The chemical weapons attack in Syria last month was not the only recent suspected use of a nerve agent by Syrian government forces. On three other occasions, government attacks left scores of people sickened with similar symptoms, like foaming at the mouth, shaking and paralysis, according to a new Human Rights Watch report. _____ \u2022 Greece reached a deal with its creditors on bailout-mandated overhauls that include pension cuts and tax rises. \u201cThe way has now been paved for debt relief talks,\u201d said Euclid Tsakalotos, above, the finance minister. \u2022 Tech giants and start-ups are turning to algorithms to spot misinformation online faster than traditional fact-checkers can. With several crucial elections in Europe ahead this year, voters stand to benefit. \u2022 Our transportation reporter, trying to find out why New York City\u2019s subway is such a mess, traveled to London to see how it works there. \u2022 Researchers are perfecting technology that sniffs out signs of disease in breath, blood and urine. \u2022  Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 \u201cBrexit\u201d talks: Discussions last week between Theresa May, the British prime minister, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, ended in acrimony, some news reports suggested. [The New York Times] \u2022 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  of Turkey is expected to rejoin the governing Justice and Development Party today, ahead of a party convention on May 21 to make him chairman. [Hurriyet] \u2022 In the Cairo district of Nasy City, militants killed three police officers and injured five others. [Reuters] \u2022 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s president, announced the creation of a new assembly to rewrite the country\u2019s Constitution, a move the opposition rejected as an attempt to avoid elections. [The New York Times] \u2022 In South Africa, Jacob Zuma, the country\u2019s increasingly unpopular president, made a hasty exit from a May Day rally that turned rowdy over his appearance. [Mail & Guardian] \u2022 In a first, SpaceX delivered a U.S. spy satellite into space. [Space.com] \u2022 Running for an hour, no matter how healthy or unhealthy you are, could add up to seven hours to your life. \u2022 Cool down all you like after exercising; you\u2019ll probably still feel sore. \u2022 Recipe of the day: For a busy night, fast tandoori chicken will get the job done right. \u2022 Apparently, cats do like people. Given a choice between human affection, toys and food in a recent study, the felines sometimes chose people. \u2022 \u201cI will dedicate my tongue and taste buds to Sino-Danish friendship.\u201d Chinese internet users offered to help Denmark eat its way through a surging population of invasive Pacific oysters. \u2022 Finally, we introduce Open Thread, a weekly fashion newsletter. Today, it\u2019s focused on the Met Gala in New York, which honors Rei Kawakubo, the founder of the Japanese brand Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. America\u2019s culinary champions gathered in Chicago for the annual James Beard Awards, the country\u2019s gastronomic Oscars. Since 1991, the event has highlighted the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the food industry. Long before the concept of celebrity chefs, James Beard, above, was hailed as a \u201ckitchen wizard\u201d and the \u201cdean of the American cookery.\u201d Born in Portland, Ore., he dropped out of college and studied voice and theater in Europe. But back in the U.S., acting didn\u2019t pay the bills, so he turned to catering and teaching clients how to cook and serve dinners \u201cin an international manner.\u201d By 1955, he founded a cooking school in New York with a basic course of six lessons: crepes and sauces, souffl\u00e9s, omelets, bread making, oven cookery and preparing a complete dinner party. More than 20 cookbooks, a pioneering TV show and a stream of formative critiques followed, paving the way for chefs like Julia Child and Marcella Hazan. He died in 1985. He professed an \u201cincurable addiction to fine caviar\u201d and was equally enamored of buttered new potatoes (though he eventually gave up the butter for health reasons). \u201cThe secret of good cooking,\u201d Mr. Beard said, \u201cis, first, having a love of it.\u201d Remy Tumin contributed reporting. _____ This briefing was prepared for the European morning.
