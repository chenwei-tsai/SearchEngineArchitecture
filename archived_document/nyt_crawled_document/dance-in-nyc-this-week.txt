The evening includes an overview of the technique\u2019s creation and excerpts from works that turn technical grammar into poetic expression: \u201cSteps in the Street,\u201d from the antiwar ballet \u201cChronicle,\u201d and two solos from \u201cCave of the Heart,\u201d Graham\u2019s telling of the myth of Medea.212-229-9200, marthagraham.org \u2018GRAND ROUNDS\u2019 at La MaMa (April 28-29, 7 p.m.; April 30, 4 p.m.; May 3-4, 7 p.m.; through May 14).
