Mr. Duterte has led a brutal crackdown on drugs in his country that has left thousands dead.

Its creators, the rapper Ja Rule and the entrepreneur Billy McFarland, are promising full refunds. \u2022 President Trump did not attend the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, but he was roasted nonetheless by the \u201cDaily Show\u201d comedian Hasan Minhaj, who also took aim at the news media. Samantha Bee of \u201cFull Frontal\u201d hosted a competing event, at which Will Ferrell dusted off his impersonation of President George W.

We look at the granddaddy of modern conspiracy speculation: Who killed President John F. Kennedy? Today, the presidency of the U.N. Security Council changes hands. That\u2019s because the five permanent members and the 10 nonpermanent members each hold the role for one month, following alphabetical order in English. Sweden was up when the year started.
