{"text": "PARIS \u2014 I\u2019ve lately been telling French people about the Hail Mary pass. I explain that it\u2019s a desperate move in American football: You\u2019re running out of time to score, so you lob the ball toward the end zone and hope for the best. The \u2019ail Marie \u2014 as I\u2019ve been pronouncing it \u2014 is the best metaphor I\u2019ve found for the French elections this Sunday. The country that gave us the Enlightenment, Cartesian logic, the Napoleonic Code and possibly reason itself may be about to just throw a ball into the distance and see what happens. Proof of this is the sudden rise of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, until recently an angry ex-Trotskyist on the left wing\u2019s colorful fringe. He probably never thought his policy ideas \u2014 like cutting the workweek to 32 hours (from a punishing 35), letting everyone retire at 60, and possibly leaving the European Union and joining an alliance with Venezuela and Cuba \u2014 would need to pass a reality test. Now he\u2019s one of the four candidates who are neck-and-neck, in a race where a third of voters say they might still change their minds. Thursday night\u2019s shooting on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es \u2014 apparently another act of terrorism here \u2014 makes the results even more uncertain. In response to the attack, each candidate appealed to a different side of the French psyche. The xenophobic nationalist Marine Le Pen warned of \u201cuninterrupted terrorism\u201d and claimed she has a \u201cbattle plan to protect France.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, of the mainstream right-wing party, pledged to make more room in prisons. The centrist Emmanuel Macron vowed to create an anti-ISIS task force, then quoted a line about bravery from \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables.\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon called for sang-froid and decided that the campaign cocktail parties he\u2019d convened around the country should go on. Until now, security had been just one of many campaign themes. A worker at my local supermarket told me he became a M\u00e9lenchoniste because the candidate promised a sixth week of annual vacation. He added that he knew Mr. M\u00e9lenchon would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the French economy, then gave me a guilty look. I\u2019d been worried about the French election for a while. For months, Ms. Le Pen had been leading the polls for the first round of voting. But after an American campaign in which the winner\u2019s policies were conveyed in three-word chants like \u201cBuild a wall\u201d and \u201cLock her up,\u201d I was reassured that French elections are usually rational affairs. In the lead-up to the vote, each candidate unveils a detailed \u201cprogramme\u201d explaining positions on everything from nuclear energy to school lunches. It can feel like you\u2019re comparison shopping for a flat-screen TV: Newspapers run charts showing each candidate\u2019s stand on different issues. It\u2019s not unusual to hear a French voter say she won\u2019t commit until she has read the programs. Despite the usual parade of programs, this year\u2019s election seems less like a reasoned debate and more like an avant-garde circus. Posters for Fran\u00e7ois Asselineau, a minor candidate who wants France to leave the European Union at once, simply say, ominously, \u201cVote your intuition.\u201d Many French voters are already doing that, which means the future of Europe might hinge on pets. An undecided 20-something told me last week that she was waiting to hear the candidates\u2019 views on animals. I assumed she was just an exceptionally committed cat owner, until I saw a poll in which 39 percent of respondents said that animal policy could influence their votes, up from 29 percent in 2012. How did it come to this, in the birthplace of Voltaire? A special issue of Philosophie Magazine, now on newsstands, explains that anti-Enlightenment thinkers have always popped up here. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe in progress,\u201d a headline warns. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust democracy. They\u2019re back.\u201d It helps to have an electorate that\u2019s more schooled in philosophy than economics. The pro-business newspaper L\u2019Opinion warned on Thursday that there\u2019s so much magical thinking on economic matters right now, \u201cwe\u2019re not very far from a psychosis.\u201d France is also recovering from the five-year presidency of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who neither solved the country\u2019s problems nor satisfied its need for a regal figurehead. Now voters are searching for a president who embodies France. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, \u201cwith his little black jacket, he is the left,\u201d the political scientist Pascal Perrineau said. \u201cHe incarnates it.\u201d The center-right Mr. Fillon may have faced some pesky corruption charges. But Mr. Fillon, the son of a provincial notary, looks just like \u201cthe son of a provincial notary,\u201d Mr. Perrineau said, a reassuringly familiar image that helped him rebound into a competitive third place. Mr. Fillon might benefit most from Thursday night\u2019s attack: He\u2019s hard-line, but still seems like someone you could invite for dinner. If \u2014 as expected \u2014 no one wins a majority on Sunday, the two front-runners will compete in a runoff two weeks later. The possibility of a showdown between Mr. M\u00e9lenchon and Ms. Le Pen has added to the surreal mood. \u201cUp until this campaign you always thought that you couldn\u2019t have two nut cases in the second round,\u201d said Catherine Fieschi, who researches the French electorate as head of the consulting company Counterpoint. \u201cNow there\u2019s a sense of, \u2018this has all become absurd and nonsensical, and if you\u2019re going to concoct such an absurd campaign, then we as voters feel entitled to behave absurdly.\u2019 \u201d There\u2019s hope in the form of the pragmatic Mr. Macron. He doesn\u2019t fit into an established French political type, but by a slim margin, he has edged ahead of Ms. Le Pen to become the front-runner in Sunday\u2019s vote. (Current polls show that if he goes head-to-head against Ms. Le Pen in Round 2, he will crush her.) An eager volunteer handed me Mr. Macron\u2019s program on the street the other day, and I practically applauded on the M\u00e9tro while reading it. I\u2019m hoping that, alone in the voting booth, faced with the gravity of their choice, French voters will, too.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/opinion/how-do-you-say-hail-mary-in-french.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T14:23:03-04:00", "abstract": "Voters here were supposed to be rational.
