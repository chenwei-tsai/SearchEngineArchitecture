{"text": "It\u2019s morning in Stardew Valley, and I\u2019m a child again! Dawn twinkles. Azure skies. Birdsong. It\u2019s dreadful. Morning after morning in the tight circadian cycles of this precious pastoral role-playing game \u2014 which has become all the rage among city-dwelling parents leery of Roblox Prison Life and similar gun-heavy games \u2014 I\u2019m reborn to about second grade. But not in the sense of fresh and innocent, suffused with wonder. I\u2019m childlike meaning incompetent, can\u2019t do a danged thing. Can\u2019t grow a potato, can\u2019t open my mailbox, can\u2019t make a friend. The friendship problem is especially grim. I approach a blonde \u2014 a honey with a \u201cHee Haw\u201d vibe \u2014 and present her with a decorative bowl as a gift. She calls me \u201cgross.\u201d Then I give a child named Demetrius some highly useful sap and he says, \u201cThis is disgusting.\u201d Another way I\u2019m like a child in Stardew Valley is that I\u2019m forever on the brink of getting in trouble \u2014 for hoeing a crooked row, missing my curfew, trying to enter a bus with a pickax. (An accident! My pickax intel was not 100 percent!) This is a game of honest toil, in dirt, with fellow farmers, requiring only the sweat of my brow and an earnest heart. So it\u2019s a little crushing to find that everything I do in Stardew Valley seems wrong. A PC game aimed at the Minecraft demo, Stardew Valley is played on a desktop or a laptop, using a platform like Steam \u2014 which is to say probably Steam itself, as Steam is considered the largest digital distribution platform for computer games. Download Steam, from which Stardew has been downloaded over a million times, and you find a trove of games that, for now, are thought more refined and dignified than console games; they also feature fewer massacres, consume less floor space that the room-swallowing sofa-television-PlayStation matrix, and can easily toggle with, say, Microsoft Word. Using discreet laptop angling you can even play Stardew and look like you\u2019re working. Stardew Valley, which in 2016 The Verge and many others named to their best-of-the-year lists, has other virtues that might turn the head of even the most principled anti-gamer. For one, the action in it is nonfelonious (unless \u201cfelony\u201d covers barely visible, accidental and entirely unwitnessed property damage to a bus with a pickax). Stardew Valley also encourages teamwork, friendship and even romance; it\u2019s downright communitarian. But best of all it\u2019s an indie game, which means it was created by a auteur developer, Eric Barone, without a megabucks publisher focus-grouping and then adjusting it to please only the alpha gamers who carp the day away on Twitch. Indie games, in other words, show the maker\u2019s hand more than market research. Minecraft also started as an indie project. But, see, I can\u2019t play Minecraft. The closest I come is eavesdropping on my children and their friends as they discuss that game\u2019s arcana, including how they might best prosecute digital goat thieves. Not only does the opaque idiom of Minecraft seem infinitely rich in their hands, but when Minecraft \u2014 and now Stardew \u2014 come up on their screens, they intuitively grasp their locations and purpose in nonspace. They also know how to amass the inventory of stuff that drives progress in these games. While I was still walking into Stardew Valley trees, and trying to chop them down with a daffodil, they had built up enough lumber for a log-homes empire. Sigh \u2014 my cabin. My foodless, loveless, plumblingless cabin. Good morning. So my avatar, who looks like a stout Andy Warhol, has learned to water the plant! I give it a good soaking. There\u2019s a bulky tube television I can\u2019t turn on; I have the good idea to sell it. My for-sale bin rejects it. I decide to go for a walk. Defying the filmic realism of console games with Cubist graphics, Stardew Valley is the magnum opus of prodigy designer Mr. Barone, whose nom de jeux is ConcernedApe. The game is a skillful revision and extension of a beloved 1997 release called Harvest Moon, and both nostalgic gamers and their offspring have greeted it as an instant old friend. It\u2019s the game\u2019s tender, clever frame story that distinguishes it. Theorists of narrative often point out that the hard-working opening paragraphs of a novel must briskly transform a person who is not reading into one who is. Stardew Valley gets this just right, with a deathbed scene wherein \u201cmy\u201d grandfather presses on me an envelope, which, in a flash-forward, I open while suffocating at a future office job, strikingly rendered by Mr. Barone as a fading tech enterprise with stained, gunmetal desks that speak of gutting despair. Grandpa\u2019s letter tells me that he once \u201clost of what mattered most in life \u2026 connections with other people and nature.\u201d He \u201cdropped everything and moved to the place where I truly belong,\u201d and suggests I follow his lead: right to a cut screen, and then an arable plot of land and sturdy cabin in the cartoon Eden of Stardew Valley. With this tale, the game brilliantly styles itself as a verdant refuge from the internet \u2014 social media, shooter games and the moral vacuum digital culture is said to open up in us. Though of course Stardew Valley is on a screen itself. I have a surprise knack for violence here. When I sorted out that the ax (not the flower) is for chopping, I became like Once-ler in \u201cThe Lorax\u201d \u2014 hacking away at the old-growth beauties and shipping the fragments off for profits. At midmorning \u2014 time flies here \u2014 I eye a bona fide cherry tree with a newfound perversity that recalls Warhol himself; I go nuts and ax it to bits. The signature transgression of the father of our country leaps to mind. Chopping down a pretty cherry tree turns out to be id-driven, and no joke. Sadly, I have no friend to whom I cannot lie. But then! The key is the daffodil! \u201cWhat a thoughtful gift!\u201d my blonde exclaims this time. I find her warmth heartening. I redouble my commitment to popularity and light off in search of first daffodils and other flowers with which to wow them; filled with purpose, I collect a cheery bouquet. On another screen my 7-year-old daughter now has enough friends for a Shire-like jamboree. I\u2019m not invited. It\u2019s almost night. In the game, that is. Tomorrow, soul refreshed by fellowship, I will actually till my land and do my grandfather proud. On a whim, I glance out my apartment\u2019s real window. It\u2019s a magnificent spring day in the real world, rich with highly realistic graphics. My window needs washing, which speckles the view, so the blue sky is also imperfect, the way the real world can sometimes be, and the Stardew farmscape is not. I\u2019ve been playing this game for hours, and \u2014 it hits me like a sock to the gut \u2014 I seem to have lost sight of what matters most in life, connections with other people and nature. Time for a walk with the children. To my surprise, they\u2019re ready to peace-out on Stardew Valley, too. We drop everything and move to the place where we truly belong.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/fashion/pastoral-living-in-stardew-valley-mesmerized-by-a-online-game.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T05:00:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T05:00:07-04:00", "abstract": "Move over, Minecraft.
