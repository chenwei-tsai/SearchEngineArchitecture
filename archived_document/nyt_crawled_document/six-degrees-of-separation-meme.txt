A mere six months later, Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times that \u201cits title has passed into the language.\u201d Mr. Guare did not invent the idea that everyone in the world is separated by only six other people, which emerged out of nearly a century of mathematical and psychological research. But it was the stickiness of his title \u2014 and the 1993 film version, starring Will Smith as the impostor \u2014 that blasted it \u201cinto the pop-culture stratosphere,\u201d as the sociologist Duncan J. Watts put it in his book \u201cSix Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age\u201d (2003). While the idea that we\u2019re all connected may seem old hat in the age of the internet, fascination with it has yielded its own rich web of associations over the years. On the eve of the play\u2019s first Broadway revival, which opens on Tuesday, April 25, here\u2019s an unscientific look at a concept that links, among other things, the first issue of Psychology Today, the star of \u201cFootloose\u201d and a shirtless J. J. Abrams. The idea of a totally connected world goes back at least to the early 20th century. As part of his broader inspiration, Mr. Guare has often cited the 1909 Nobel Prize lecture by the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi, a pioneer of wireless telegraphy, who envisioned a network of towers that could send messages to any part of the globe. Mr. Guare, in a recent interview, said he first encountered the six-degrees concept in 1967, in the inaugural issue of Psychology Today, which featured a cover story about the psychologist Stanley Milgram\u2019s \u201csmall world\u201d experiment. The experiment involved giving a letter to random people in Omaha and Wichita, Kan., with instructions to give it to someone who could give it to someone who would help it reach a designated individual in Boston. Evidently, Ouisa Kittredge, one half of the couple in Mr. Guare\u2019s play, saw the same article. \u201cI read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people,\u201d she says during the increasingly desperate search to find \u201cPaul\u201d Poitier (who was based on a real con artist) after he disappears. \u201cThe president of the United States. A gondolier in Venice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the big names,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s anyone.\u201d The phrase is often seen as an inspiring, even mystical symbol. But the speech, Mr. Guare notes, was meant ironically, as a comment on racial exclusion and social stratification in America. \u201cThe nightmare of the play becomes finding the right six people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can find everyone in the world, but you can\u2019t find one black man whose name you don\u2019t know.\u201d Mr. Guare said he was \u201ctickled\u201d when he started seeing the phrase \u201csix degrees of separation\u201d in different contexts: an ad for Air France, a newspaper article about the 1992 presidential election. And then came Kevin Bacon. The now-famous Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game was invented in 1994 by Craig Fass, Brian Turtle and Mike Ginelli, three students at Albright College in Reading, Pa., who were sitting around watching \u201cFootloose.\u201d They started naming other movies Mr. Bacon had appeared in, and came up with the idea that he was the unacknowledged center of the Hollywood universe, who connected everyone. The three friends performed their parlor trick on \u201cThe Jon Stewart Show\u201d on MTV a few months later. Next came a book (with an introduction by Mr. Bacon) and a board game. Mr. Bacon (who declined to be interviewed for this article) would go on to found SixDegrees.org, which matches celebrities with charities, and star in a Visa commercial that parodied the six-degrees concept. But at a 20th-anniversary panel with Mr. Turtle and others at SXSW in Austin, Tex., in 2014, he recalled his initial mystification. \u201cPeople would come up to me and touch me and say, \u2018I\u2019m one degree!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what was going on.\u201d The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon board game, which appeared in 1997, featured 20-sided dice. But the true great leap forward came a year earlier, when Brett Tjaden, a graduate student in computer science at the University of Virginia who sometimes played the parlor game, created The Oracle of Bacon, a website that generated authoritative \u201cBacon numbers\u201d based on data from the Internet Movie Database. \u201cI did it mainly for myself and my friends,\u201d Mr. Tjaden, now a professor at James Madison University, said in a phone interview. \u201cThey sent the link to their friends, who sent it to a couple of their friends, and before too long it was famous.\u201d Time Magazine named it one of its top 10 websites of 1996. Today, it has the same Web 1.0 look, though its Center of the Hollywood Universe list is updated regularly. (Mr. Bacon is No. 457, while the current center is \u2026 Eric Roberts?) The website drew the attention of Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz, two leading researchers in the emerging field of network theory, who drew on it for a seminal paper. It also inspired other riffs, like the Oracle of Baseball; Degrees of Wikipedia, which calculates links between Wikipedia pages; and Erdos-Bacon numbers, which combine a person\u2019s proximity to both the Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdos, which has long been a benchmark for mathematicians, and Mr. Bacon. (Natalie Portman\u2019s Erdos-Bacon number, in case you are wondering, has been calculated as seven.) The Oracle of Bacon still has about 10,000 visitors on an average day, according to Patrick Reynolds, a software engineer in Florida who runs it. \u201cTo me, it says that a meme never really goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything lives forever until you pull the plug.\u201d The concept got another boost in 1999, when The New Yorker published an article by Malcolm Gladwell called \u201cSix Degrees of Lois Weisberg,\u201d which used Ms. Weisberg \u2014 at the time the cultural affairs commissioner of Chicago (and the mother of one of Mr. Gladwell\u2019s friends) \u2014 as a case study in the surprising science of social connection. The article, which was later adapted for Mr. Gladwell\u2019s monster best seller \u201cThe Tipping Point,\u201d dug into research by Milgram, Mark Granovetter (who developed the concept of strong versus weak social ties) and others. But the big ideas, Mr. Gladwell said in a phone interview, came second. \u201cShe was kind of a hilarious person, and I wanted an excuse to hang out with her,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article was really a delivery vehicle for Lois Weisberg.\u201d The article popularized the idea of \u201cconnectors\u201d: people who know unusually large numbers of people and are unusually given to making introductions, the rough equivalent of hubs in a computer network. \u201cNot all degrees are created equal,\u201d Mr. Gladwell wrote. The article\u2019s teaser summary put it even more dramatically: \u201cShe\u2019s a grandmother, she lives in a big house in Chicago, and you\u2019ve never heard of her. Does she run the world?\u201d Ms. Weisberg, who died last year at 90, may have run the world, but she didn\u2019t necessarily appreciate Mr. Gladwell\u2019s telling everyone about it. \u201cI think I made her life a little difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t interested in celebrity of any kind.\u201d The play, Mr. Guare said, is \u201can antique piece.\u201d Nowadays, a quick Google search \u2014 or text message to the Kittredges\u2019 children, whom Paul supposedly knows from Harvard \u2014 would have blown Paul\u2019s cover immediately. On the other hand, social media has made it possible to be \u201cfriends\u201d with people you don\u2019t actually know, while also providing vast data sets for calculating the number of links separating people scattered around the world. The degree of separation, it turns out, is less than six. Last year, researchers at Facebook reported that the 1.59 billion people on its network were separated from one another by only about 3.5 people. And that number had been shrinking: Five years earlier, when there were fewer than half as many people on the site, the figure was 3.74. The six-degrees idea has a cosmic undertow that writers and directors have been happy to ride. The movies \u201cBabel\u201d and \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d as well as \u201cLost,\u201d the head-scratching television series cocreated by J. J. Abrams, featured characters unknowingly linked across huge swaths of space and time. The movies \u201cCrash\u201d and \u201cMagnolia\u201d (both set in Los Angeles) and the short-lived ABC series \u201cSix Degrees\u201d (another Abrams project, set in New York) offered more localized versions. Virginia Heffernan, reviewing \u201cSix Degrees\u201d in The New York Times, said it reflected \u201cthe shared citywide creed\u201d that \u201cmight be called Manhattan paganism: a private, almost secretive belief in coincidence, chance, accident and serendipity.\u201d But here\u2019s a real coincidence for you: Back in 1993, Mr. Abrams was an aspiring actor whose film credits included \u2026 a small part in the film adaptation of \u201cSix Degrees of Separation.\u201d He played Doug, a college student whose father has also been taken in by Paul. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot! You\u2019re an idiot!\u201d a (shirtless) Mr. Abrams screams into the phone at the climax of his minute-long scene. By the way, Mr. Abrams was in that movie with Donald Sutherland, who was in \u201cAnimal House\u201d (1978) with Kevin Bacon, giving him a Bacon number of 2.", "item_type": "Article"}
