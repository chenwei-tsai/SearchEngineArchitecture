{"text": "A Family Court judge in Kentucky has recused himself from adoption cases involving gay and lesbian parents, saying that \u201cas a matter of conscience\u201d he could not be impartial. In a court order on Thursday, the judge, W. Mitchell Nance, wrote that he believed \u201cunder no circumstance\u201d would the best interests of a child be served in an adoption by a \u201cpracticing homosexual.\u201d Judge Nance, of the Family Court in Barren and Metcalfe Counties, declined to comment on Monday. Any cases involving gay and lesbian parents will be heard instead by another judge, John T. Alexander, and the court said there would be no delays in the adoption process, according to a case manager at the Family Court. But Judge Nance\u2019s on-the-record proclamation that he could not fairly rule on matters of gay and lesbian parenting rankled L.G.B.T. advocates in the state, and prompted critics to question whether he could perform the rest of his duties. \u201cWhat we have is a judge who has made a record of his inability to be a fair and impartial judge for a whole class of citizens who are entitled to have a fair and impartial judge,\u201d Sam Marcosson, a professor of law at the University of Louisville who focuses on civil rights issues for L.G.B.T. people, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cIt raises serious problems about his fitness for office going forward.\u201d Though there was recently a patchwork of state laws, all 50 states now allow adoption by gay parents after Mississippi\u2019s ban was struck down in May 2016. Most research suggests that children of gay and lesbian parents fare no worse than other children. Researchers at Columbia Law School said 75 of 79 scholarly studies that met their criteria concluded that the children faced no disadvantages. Abbie Goldberg, an associate professor at Clark University, said children of same-sex couples have consistently measured similarly to children of heterosexual couples in areas like self-esteem, depression, anxiety and satisfaction. \u201cThere\u2019s really no difference, which is actually quite remarkable when you think about the additional layer of stigma these children are growing up with,\u201d she said. Critics of same-sex parenting have frequently pointed to a 2012 study by a University of Texas sociologist that suggests children of gay and lesbian parents are significantly different from children raised by heterosexual couples. That study has been roundly criticized by others in academia. Judge Nance\u2019s decision to recuse himself comes less than two years after Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, defied federal court orders to issue same-sex marriage licenses because it went against her Christian beliefs. She was jailed for her refusal and became a symbol of the resistance to same-sex marriage. The Family Foundation, a Lexington-based group that says it seeks to \u201cstrengthen Kentucky families,\u201d offered praise for Judge Nance\u2019s decision, saying, \u201cJudges have a right of conscience like everyone else.\u201d \u201cIf we are going to let liberal judges write their personal biases and prejudices into law, as we have done on issues of marriage and sexuality, then, in the interest of fairness, we are going to have to allow judges with different views to at least recuse themselves from such cases,\u201d Martin Cothran, a spokesman for the group, said in a statement. Other judges have faced consequences for similar stances on L.G.B.T. issues. A judge in Wyoming was censured in March for refusing to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, and an Alabama judge was suspended in September for ordering probate judges to defy federal orders to issue marriage licenses. Some critics called for Judge Nance to resign or face ethics charges after Thursday\u2019s order. Chris Hartman, director of the Fairness Campaign, an L.G.B.T. advocacy group, said the order displayed \u201cclear discrimination.\u201d \u201cIf you can\u2019t deliver the basic tenets of his position, which are to exercise impartiality, fairness and justice for all people, he shouldn\u2019t be on the bench,\u201d he said. Mr. Marcosson, a former board member of the of the National Lesbian and Gay Legal Association, said the recusal from adoption cases would not be enough. The judge\u2019s fairness would now be questioned in any cases involving L.G.B.T. people, including custody or divorce cases, he said. \u201cHe\u2019s sent a message, an explicit message, that he\u2019s biased about a whole range of issues that might come before him,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a judge simply cannot apply the law because of his or her personal views, it\u2019s perfectly honorable for that judge to resign.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/kentucky-judge-refuses-same-sex-adoption-cases.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T18:34:14-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T18:34:14-04:00", "abstract": "The judge said he believed \u201cunder no circumstance\u201d would the best interests of a child be served in an adoption by a \u201cpracticing homosexual.\u201d", "title": "Kentucky Judge, Citing Conscience, Declines to Hear Same-Sex Adoption Cases"}
