Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 On one hand, China has been trying to ease fears of a U.S.-North Korean military confrontation. But on the other, it\u2019s underscoring territorial ambitions that have set other regional players on edge, launching its first domestically built aircraft carrier. China also protested as the U.S. military began installing a Thaad missile defense system in South Korea, where the deployment has become a contentious issue in the May 9 election to replace the ousted president. _____ \u2022 Another issue playing out in South Korea\u2019s presidential race: denunciations of gay soldiers in the country\u2019s army. They have become targets for right-wing Christian groups, and the military itself has charged some with \u201csodomy or other disgraceful conduct.\u201d Critics accuse the military of distracting itself from the threat from the North. _____ \u2022 Asian tensions were also a focus in Washington. Above, senators boarded a bus for the White House to be briefed on North Korea. Female activists from more than 40 countries, including North and South Korea, urged President Trump to defuse military tensions and instead negotiate for peace. _____ \u2022 President Trump outlined a tax proposal that would ease the burden on businesses and primarily benefit wealthy Americans, skip a \u201cborder-adjustment\u201d tariff on imports and encourage corporations not to move their bases abroad. And our investigation of the real-estate empire of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and top adviser to President Trump, reveals a new potential conflict of interest: a crucial partnership with a member of the Steinmetz family, one of Israel\u2019s wealthiest. _____ \u2022 \u201cClambering onto a rooftop with a small group of soldiers from Iraq\u2019s counterterrorism service, we scanned the Islamic State\u2019s stronghold in western Mosul as one of its armored car bombs maneuvered toward the front line.\u201d Our reporters take you into the heart of the war-torn city, where civilians are trapped by vehicle bombs and snipers. And our seven-minute video tracks how Syria and its main partner, Russia, distorted the facts surrounding a recent chemical weapons attack in northern Syria. _____ \u2022 Historic sites and natural wonders around the world \u2014 including the Great Barrier Reef, Venice, the famed statues of Easter Island, even the Statue of Liberty in New York \u2014 face profound risks from global warming. Our climate reporter ventured to Tasmania, where he found rising sea levels threatening island cemeteries, like the one above, and a 19th-century prison that serves as one of Australia\u2019s premier tourist attractions. \u2022 Huawei Technologies, China\u2019s technology giant, is the focus of a widening U.S. investigation into whether the company broke American trade controls on Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. \u2022 Fox News, still grappling with fallout from its ouster of the star host Bill O\u2019Reilly, was sued by 11 current and former employees, who accused the network of \u201cabhorrent, intolerable, unlawful and hostile racial discrimination.\u201d \u2022 Our \u201cDaily\u201d podcast discusses the challenges facing Uber\u2019s chief, Travis Kalanick. \u2022 U.S. stocks were down slightly. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Turkey accused more than a thousand police officers of supporting an exiled cleric the government blames for inspiring a failed coup in July. [The New York Times] \u2022 United Airlines is facing another public relations battle after a three-foot rabbit died on a flight between Britain and the U.S. [The New York Times] \u2022 A haggard Taiwanese hiker missing in Nepal for seven weeks was found by rescuers \u2014 three days after his girlfriend, lost with him, died. [South China Morning Post] \u2022 In Australia, vitriol is still building against a Sudanese-born TV host who invoked offshore detentions on Anzac Day. [The New York Times] \u2022 India closed  social networking services in Kashmir to try to quell mounting waves of protests and violence. [The New York Times] \u2022 Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced plans to intervene to bring down soaring prices in the country\u2019s gas market. [The Sydney Morning Herald] \u2022 Mr. Turnbull will meet President Trump in New York next week. [The New York Times] \u2022 Former President Barack Obama agreed on a $400,000 fee to speak at a health care conference sponsored by a Wall Street investment firm later this year. [The New York Times] \u2022 Looking to build up strength and muscle? A heavier bench press might not be necessary. \u2022 Get happy: Here are four ways to cultivate a better you. \u2022 A former chef at California\u2019s famed Chez Panisse offers her take on the classic Caesar salad, as well as a lyrical tribute to the transformative powers of salt. \u2022 Modern humans didn\u2019t even leave Africa until perhaps 50,000 years ago, yet new research involving the gouges on the rock above suggests that a lost species of humans occupied what is now California 130,000 years ago. \u2022 \u201cHe\u2019s put the world on notice \u2014 we\u2019re back.\u201d As President Trump approaches his 100th day in office, we circled back with some of the voters who supported him. \u2022 Jonathan Demme, the Oscar-winning director of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d and \u201cPhiladelphia,\u201d died on Wednesday at the age of 73. \u2022 In her inaugural column on desserts, Dorie Greenspan \u2014 who just won her third James Beard award \u2014 writes in the Times Magazine about the \u201cjoyful, comforting, gratifying and even magical\u201d practice of making biscuits. Tomorrow, Pope Francis will be visiting Egypt, the second trip by a modern pope to the biblical land, after John Paul\u2019s visit in 2000. Francis is expected to meet another pope, one who is little known outside the country: Tawadros II of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Above, the two meeting at the Vatican in 2013. Copts consider Tawadros II their 118th pope, after the apostle Mark is said to have established the church in Alexandria, in northern Egypt, in the first century. The two churches parted ways in a dispute about the nature of Christ in the fifth century. It wasn\u2019t until 1973 that a Coptic pope visited the Vatican, mending ties that had been severed for centuries. Unlike his Roman Catholic counterpart, who is chosen by a group of cardinals, the Coptic pope is selected by a process that is said to incorporate the hand of God. When Tawadros II\u2019s predecessor, Shenouda III, died in 2012, an electoral college of clergy and laymen selected a shortlist of three candidates. Crystal balls sealed with wax containing the candidates\u2019 names were then taken to the St. Mark Cathedral in Cairo. There, a blindfolded 6-year-old boy in a white robe picked Tawadros\u2019s name from a glass bowl. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ This briefing was prepared for the Australian morning.
