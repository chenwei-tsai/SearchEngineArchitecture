{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 On the night the director Lee Daniels offered Gabourey Sidibe the lead in \u201cPrecious,\u201d the role that would earn her an Oscar nomination, Mr. Daniels asked if she had a boyfriend. Ms. Sidibe, then a 24-year-old psychology major whose training as an actor had been confined to her work as a phone-sex operator, as well as roles in college productions of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d and \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d answered tartly. \u201cNo,\u201d Ms. Sidibe told him, \u201cbut now that I\u2019m going to be a movie star, I\u2019m going to get pregnant by a basketball player and lock down that child support.\u201d Mr. Daniels cracked up, and the deal was sealed. \u201cSarcasm is my birth defect,\u201d Ms. Sidibe, now 33, said recently. \u201cI was born cynical.\u201d Like many smart young women whose precociousness put them at odds with their peers \u2014 by fourth grade, Ms. Sidibe said, she was an entrenched outlier \u2014 sarcasm has been both weapon and armor. She deployed it to fine effect in her upside-down household in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, where she and her older brother were raised by their warm, Southern mother and stern African father, whose family traditions extended to polygamy \u2014 \u201cI know!\u201d Ms. Sidibe said \u2014 and who called his firstborn daughter \u201cfatso,\u201d as did her relatives, while outlining her future as a good Muslim wife. Her sarcasm is on rueful display in her new memoir, \u201cThis Is Just My Face: Try Not to Stare\u201d (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt), in which she writes of trying to please a father for whom she is too American, too vivid and altogether too much. Her parents married when her father, who trained as an architect and worked as a taxi driver, offered to pay her mother to marry him so that he could apply for a green card. A year later, she fell in love with her paper husband. \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Ms. Sidibe writes. \u201cMy mother is so classy that you have to marry her and then wait a year before she gives you any play.\u201d She writes of her panic when they divorced, and her mother gave up her teaching career to become a subway singer, at the same time that the family of three moved into a single room of her aunt\u2019s Harlem townhouse. (They would later move to a studio apartment nearby, where all three shared a bunk bed.) Ms. Sidibe\u2019s aunt is Dorothy Pitman Hughes, a founder of Ms. Magazine; a famous portrait from 1971, of Ms. Pitman Hughes and Gloria Steinem raising their fists in a Black Power salute, hung in her sitting room, where Ms. Sidibe passed it every day on her way to school, and Ms. Steinem was a regular guest. While Ms. Sidibe averred that she is \u201ca link on a chain of powerful women,\u201d her own steely self-confidence, she said, wasn\u2019t nurtured by her activist relatives so much as a survival skill she taught herself in the bruising theater of elementary school. \u201cChildren are horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI was horrible.\u201d Ms. Sidibe and I were holed up in a basement reading room at the Museum of Contemporary Art after touring the Kerry James Marshall exhibit upstairs. She wore a ruffled, daffodil-yellow dress and, for our interview, a pair of glasses. Last May, Ms. Sidibe bought a house in this city, a three-bedroom painted inside with bold colors and accessorized by African prints, surrounded by a white picket fence and climbing roses. But she had suggested the museum instead as a meeting place. Mr. Marshall\u2019s exuberant paintings of black American life come with a manifesto she feels more strongly than ever, given the political climate. \u201cI\u2019m really starting to regret voting for Trump,\u201d she said, poker-faced, and then snorted with laughter. Later she said, \u201cEven though I\u2019ve been black and proud my whole life, now I want to be draped in my culture; I want to be draped in my blackness.\u201d She also wants to be swathed in privacy. Just after \u201cPrecious\u201d made her famous, when a crew from a magazine showed up at the West End apartment where she was living at the time, drawing a crowd of onlookers, Ms. Sidibe had a full-blown panic attack. \u201cI was an anxious kid, and now I\u2019m an anxious adult,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to shut it down.\u201d (In her book, she writes of her deep wariness of strangers. \u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d she would ask her parents\u2019 guests the moment they arrived. It was particularly trying for her when Ms. Sidibe\u2019s father ensconced his female \u201ccousin\u201d in her bedroom and bed for months; it wasn\u2019t until much later that she realized the woman was her father\u2019s second wife, as in the woman he had married back home in Senegal while still married to Ms. Sidibe\u2019s mother.) Ms. Sidibe was working at the phone-sex company and had just started Mercy College in Manhattan, her second college stint, when a friend told her about a casting call for \u201cPrecious.\u201d She showed up almost as an afterthought, though five years earlier she had read \u201cPush,\u201d the novel by Sapphire, from which the movie was adapted, when a casting agent had wanted to cast Ms. Sidibe\u2019s mother as the monstrous onscreen mother who would eventually be played by Mo\u2019Nique. To Mr. Daniels, the harrowing role of Precious, an obese and illiterate teenager who had been sexually abused by her father and was drawn partly from the author\u2019s real-life experience, had seemed out of reach for most Hollywood actresses. So he created a \u201cPrecious\u201d boot camp, casting young women with no training, many of whom were the victims of abuse and the foster care system. But none worked out, he said, \u201cand the search was mad on, and the clock was ticking.\u201d Ms. Sidibe\u2019s audition \u201cwas exquisite,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cGabby tapped her life experience in a way that was beautiful and wasn\u2019t tragic,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe came in as an actor, though she was unaware of her instrument and her ability.\u201d Yet Ms. Sidibe had had training, although it was unorthodox. Upended by panic attacks, depression and bulimia, she had dropped out of college to attend an intensive, six-month program of dialectical behavioral therapy, at which her fellow patients called her \u201cthe happiest person at Sad Camp,\u201d and from which she emerged with unlooked-for job skills like \u201cactive listening,\u201d a linchpin of psychotherapy. \u201cI put it on my resume,\u201d she said, \u201ceven though I had learned it as a patient, not a student.\u201d (Since she didn\u2019t yet have actual job skills, her therapist suggested telemarketing as a profession, though, \u201cfor some reason, I heard \u2018phone sex,\u2019\u201d she said.) Active listening, Ms. Sidibe added, made her a terrific phone-sex operator, which in turn gave her acting chops, particularly since the \u201cphone ho station,\u201d as she called it, was staffed mostly by plus-size African-American women, all of whom were playing the role of a barely legal white teenager of limited intelligence. \u201cI learned to talk to anyone,\u201d she said, \u201cto lead with my personality and to not be afraid. We\u2019re all human.\u201d Even the businessman who wears women\u2019s underpants under his suit, she said, \u201cmaybe especially him,\u201d though Ms. Sidibe was most moved by the soldiers calling from Afghanistan wanting to talk to someone who wasn\u2019t, she said, \u201cthe person they were lonely for, because it only made them lonelier.\u201d \u201cSo it was like a normal conversation,\u201d she continued. \u201c\u2018What kind of soda do you like?\u2019 \u2018What kind of beer?\u2019\u201d Phone work paid well, but she quit to play Precious. Money was tight after the film wrapped; she was paid scale, about $2,500 a week, but it took a month for her to receive her first check. After \u201cPrecious\u201d made its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2009, Ms. Sidibe experienced fame without fortune, riding subways and buses to red carpet events. Life at home was still precarious. On the morning of one event, her landlord tried to evict the family for what turned out to be a clerical error. Her income that year was about $50,000, just under half of which was from the phone-sex work \u2014 and almost double what her mother made, earning Ms. Sidibe head of household status on the family tax returns, a position that made her anxious. Even after her Oscar nomination, and years of steady roles on shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cEmpire,\u201d and films like \u201cTower Heist,\u201d money and family would continue to bedevil her. She took to paying her parents\u2019 rents before paying her own, in a stew of guilt and pride, and constantly fielding entreaties from more distant relatives. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice, Ms. Sidibe writes, \u201cif money bought love? But it doesn\u2019t. It buys resentment.\u201d As musuemgoers wandered in and out of the reading room, bemused by the sight of Ms. Sidibe and me hunkered down on a sofa there, she said: \u201cHonestly, I think women in general have a lot of guilt. I think it\u2019s a woman\u2019s burden. I think even more so a black woman\u2019s burden. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea of the strong black woman. We\u2019re put upon in so many different ways. And so my guilt comes from: \u2018You know you should be nicer. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re uncomfortable, you have to do this.\u2019 I\u2019ve been uncomfortable my whole life. I just don\u2019t want to be uncomfortable anymore.\u201d In 2014, Ms. Sidibe found herself courted by literary agents, after she spoke, along with Chelsea Handler and Amy Schumer, at a Ms. Foundation awards gala that was also a party for Ms. Steinem\u2019s 80th birthday. The activist, actress and comedian Kathy Najimy said she was in charge of \u201ccurating the right voices, and Gabby seemed to be that perfect voice.\u201d She recalled that after Ms. Sidibe spoke, it was like church. The speech involved a childhood memory and a crisis of confidence, a story about how Ms. Sidibe had baked cookies for a fourth-grade party and was shunned by her classmates. At first, Ms. Sidibe said, she sat glumly at her desk before taking herself in hand. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is also my party, and I\u2019m going to have a good time,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was aware I was smart. I read books. I had zero friends. It wasn\u2019t because I was fat. It was because I was\u201d \u2014 and here she used a pungent expletive that had brought the house down that night at the gala. \u201cI was really sarcastic and children don\u2019t understand sarcasm.\u201d \u201cPeople are always asking me why or how I\u2019m so confident,\u201d Ms. Sidibe added, describing the essence of the talk. \u201cBut what they really mean is why are you so confident. They are not asking Rihanna. They are asking me, because they don\u2019t think I should be. That\u2019s what the cookie story was about, and that\u2019s what started the book.\u201d Ms. Najimy said: \u201cBeing heavy for her wasn\u2019t about self hate. We had that in common: being a person in Hollywood who doesn\u2019t look like a person should look in Hollywood. People can\u2019t believe you walk through the world without fear because they are so paralyzed with fear about how they look. They can\u2019t believe you have the confidence and the balls to get onstage, that you dress in cute clothes and are not ashamed.\u201d In her book, Ms. Sidibe says, \u201cMy body sometimes feels like a tragedy, but I\u2019m trying very hard to change my mind about that.\u201d But she also acknowledges the power of her unconventional beauty, which makes this memoir a book you will want to give your daughter. Entertainment Weekly reported that it sold at auction for $2.5 million. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite that much,\u201d said David Kuhn, the agent she chose. Eighteen publishers, Mr. Kuhn said, had asked for a meeting with Ms. Sidibe, who was in town for just a few days and could meet with only 10. So he held a preauction to winnow her suitors. \u201cI was ready to sell the book for $70,000,\u201d Ms. Sidibe said. \u201cIt was much more than I expected. I was very surprised.\u201d But readers of her Twitter and Instagram feeds, where she plays a modern, though still profane, Dorothy Parker, might not have been. \u201cGabby doesn\u2019t just spew,\u201d said Jussie Smollett, her co-star on \u201cEmpire,\u201d the Fox series created by Mr. Daniels that is now in its third season. \u201cShe\u2019s snappy and down with the clapback and hilarious without being mean.\u201d Mr. Smollett plays Jamal, the \u201cgood\u201d son, on the \u201cDallas\u201d-like drama in which the family business is hip-hop, not oil, and Ms. Sidibe plays Becky, the long-suffering assistant to Luscious Lyon, the show\u2019s patriarch and King Lear-figure, played by Terrence Howard. Mr. Smollett wrote to Ms. Sidibe years before they met on the set. It was just after \u201cPrecious\u201d had made her a star, he said. \u201cI had seen her on the red carpet and she was talking to Ryan Seacrest about Gerard Butler, and she said something like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019d hit that.\u2019\u201d Mr. Smollett said he was entranced by her brashness. \u201c\u2018Precious\u2019 was so sad, but Gabby was a ball of happiness. I wrote her then and said: \u2018I think we\u2019re going to be best friends. You\u2019re going to be the She-Ra to my He-Man.\u2019 Then I got \u2018Empire,\u2019 and from that moment we\u2019ve been like peanut butter and jelly.\u201d Mr. Daniels remembered that after \u201cPrecious,\u201d people said Ms. Sidibe would never work again. People would make the mistake \u2014 as he almost did \u2014 that no actor could nail the role, and they would continue to confuse Ms. Sidibe with the character of \u201cPrecious.\u201d In those early years of her career, interviewers were surprised that she was not, in fact, a beaten-down illiterate teenager. The internet was predictably vicious. \u201cWhale, gorilla, elephant\u201d were typical epithets for Precious, she said, along with more insidious commentary. \u201cA lot of people were concerned that I was \u2018promoting unhealthy eating habits,\u2019\u201d she writes. \u201cFunny. I could\u2019ve sworn I was promoting a movie.\u201d At Halloween, people would dress up as Precious by stuffing sweatshirts with pillows and blackening their faces, and her friends would send her photos because they found them funny and thought she would, too. Ms. Sidibe writes of the time she overheard Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, the Vogue editor, on speaker phone with Mr. Daniels, crowing: \u201cI am putting that fat bitch right on the cover of Vogue. I love her. That black bitch will be on the cover.\u201d Mr. Daniels pointed out that the word can be a term of endearment. \u201cI think it was said in love,\u201d he recalled, adding that he was rather large at the time. \u201cIt was almost a militant, defiant statement about the movie.\u201d But even though Ms. Sidibe might have joined in had she been in the room, she was stung. \u201cI know what I looked like, I had mirrors in my home,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut at the time I thought that if I could just get the world to see me the way I saw myself, then my body wouldn\u2019t be the thing you walked away thinking about.\u201d When she decided last spring to have bariatric surgery after years of living secretly with diabetes, the first doctor she interviewed confused her with Amber Riley, another young, black plus-size actor. Ms. Sidibe went with another surgeon. She told only one person about her \u201cvery grown-up surgery,\u201d said her friend Kia Perry, who took care of her. Then Ms. Sidibe told Mr. Daniels. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Bitch, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d she recalled in the interview. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Cocaine?\u2019\u201d Are we ever going to stop scrutinizing women\u2019s bodies? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. \u201cI try my best. I\u2019m very sensitive to this question. Even when someone is really tall, I try not to be like, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re tall!\u2019 because that person effing knows. I don\u2019t want to talk about my body. I\u2019m bored with it. I wrote about it because I don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/fashion/gabourey-sidibe-memoir.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T12:23:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T12:21:28-04:00", "abstract": "The actress best known for \u201cPrecious\u201d and \u201cEmpire\u201d writes in her new memoir about weight, anxiety and the phone-sex school of drama in \u201cThis Is Just My Face: Try Not to Stare.\u201d", "title": "Gabourey Sidibe Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About Her Body"}
