This stance, critics say, represents a shift from Mr. Trump\u2019s own drain-the-swamp campaign message and his promise to decrease the influence of lobbyists, special interest groups and big political donors. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, facing a barrage of questions about the president\u2019s commitment to transparency, repeatedly shut down reporters\u2019 queries \u2014 from the identity of Mr. Trump\u2019s weekend golf partners to his refusal to release his 2016 tax returns. Mr. Spicer said that greater public disclosure was unnecessary, intrusive or even harmful. He defended Mr. Trump\u2019s reversal of President Barack Obama\u2019s practice of periodically releasing West Wing visitor logs, and suggested that doing so would discourage outsiders who require anonymity to offer frank advice to the president and his top advisers. \u201cI think that we recognize that there\u2019s a privacy aspect to allowing citizens to come, express their views,\u201d Mr. Spicer told reporters. He added that an earlier practice of exempting national security officials from the logs made Mr. Obama\u2019s release of visitor names a \u201cfaux\u201d transparency. \u201cWe are going to follow the law the way that every administration has followed up until the last one,\u201d he said. Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, conceded that Mr. Obama\u2019s practice was \u201cless than perfect.\u201d But he said Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release any of the logs represented a \u201cmajor step backward\u201d for presidential transparency. \u201cSometimes I think the president doesn\u2019t understand the line between being a private businessman and serving the public trust, and he thinks he can just run his life the same way he\u2019s done for 50 years,\u201d Mr. Cummings said. \u201cBut this is about the public trust. If you want to get rich, don\u2019t get into politics. I know that. If you want privacy, don\u2019t go into politics. He needs to learn that.\u201d Mr. Spicer spoke after a weekend of demonstrations over Mr. Trump\u2019s longstanding refusal to release his tax returns. He said that voters elected the president with full knowledge that he was breaking decades of precedent by refusing to release his taxes. Mr. Spicer also repeated the president\u2019s argument that continuing, routine audits of his taxes prevented them from being made public. \u201cI think the people understand, you know, how successful the president has been and how much he\u2019s paid in taxes,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. During the campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly said he would release his taxes once the audits were completed, but since has backed off that pledge. A Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll last week found that Americans believed, by a 53 to 32 percent margin, that Mr. Trump should be required to release his returns. When a reporter asked Mr. Spicer on Monday if the president ever intended to release the information, he deadpanned, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get back to you on that.\u201d Later, a deputy for Mr. Spicer emailed that all presidents undergo automatic I.R.S. audits, meaning that Mr. Trump now has a blanket rationale for never releasing the returns if he chooses to maintain his current course. \u201cHe is not interested in public disclosure. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the first president in modern history, since Nixon, to hide his taxes,\u201d said Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush and a frequent Trump critic. \u201cThe American people voted for him to be president; they didn\u2019t vote for him to come into this office with a whole bunch of conflicts of interest, they didn\u2019t elect him to do whatever he wanted,\u201d Mr. Painter added. When Julie Pace, a reporter for The Associated Press who serves on the board of the White House Correspondents Association, complained about the scarcity of information about the president\u2019s activities at his Florida vacation resort, Mr. Spicer responded by saying the White House was doing a \u201cfairly good job\u201d of keeping journalists in the loop. \u201cObviously, the president has, you know, time to spend with family,\u201d he said. \u201cHe makes phone calls. We generally provide readouts of those phone calls with foreign leaders, whether he\u2019s here or in Florida.\u201d Then another reporter asked Mr. Spicer if it was fair to say, \u201cthis is the least transparent administration in decades.\u201d He responded by pointing to the \u201cpool sprays\u201d \u2014 where a small group of reporters and photographers are briefly allowed to interact with the president and attendees of White House meetings before being ushered out. \u201cI think that we\u2019ve taken several steps to allow people\u2019s access to this White House,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cWe hold regular pool sprays, we bring people in, we release participant lists, we give press the opportunity to come into the room, see everybody who\u2019s there, hear part of the discussion.\u201d", "abstract": "The White House defended its less-is-more practices, saying that releasing information on wide topics would impede President Trump\u2019s ability to govern.", "section": "U.S.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/us/politics/spicer-argues-that-more-public-disclosure-is-unnecessary-even-harmful.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Spicer Argues That More Public Disclosure Is Unnecessary, Even Harmful", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T20:54:56-04:00"}
