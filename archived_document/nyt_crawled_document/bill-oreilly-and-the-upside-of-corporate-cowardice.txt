Mr. Murdoch\u2019s Fox News announced Wednesday that it will part with its star host Bill O\u2019Reilly weeks after a New York Times investigation into sexual harassment charges led more than 50 companies, under pressure from protesters, to pull their ads from \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the only recent boycott. Last month, North Carolina passed a face-saving reversal of its bill that prevented transgendered people from using the bathroom of their choice after a host of companies and organizations, including the N.C.A.A., said they wouldn\u2019t do business in the state. A campaign by the group Sleeping Giants has shamed hundreds of marketers into pulling their ads from the right-wing Breitbart News. A threatened boycott has extracted a promise from United Airlines that it will no longer violently remove passengers in favor of a company employee. If you\u2019ve flown United recently, you\u2019ll know that\u2019s progress. What\u2019s driving these about-faces? There\u2019s little evidence that broad-based boycotts actually hurt a company\u2019s bottom line; in fact, loyal customers often increase their patronage. Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ratings rose after the Times investigation. After the Cracker Barrel chain fired gay employees in 1991, visits to the restaurants rose in the face of protests. In 1977, when a Georgia group threatened a boycott of the Girl Scouts of America for its endorsement of the Equal Rights Amendment, cookie sales went through the roof. But boycotts can cause a significant drop in share price, according to a 2007 study of boycotts over a 28-year period. In other words, shareholders react to their own fear of what might happen to the company\u2019s brand, and not to what\u2019s actually happening to its revenue. The economist A. O. Hirschman might describe this as a triumph of voice over exit. Protesters (voice) cause a shift in corporate behavior, even if consumers don\u2019t exercise their option to stop buying the product (exit). None of the companies that pulled out of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d or Breitbart News are exactly a profile in courage. The basic allegations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly have been known since 2004, when he settled his first lawsuit, but that didn\u2019t stop companies from advertising until more women came forward. Though in some cases, corporate cowardice is a good thing. American business is often accused of producing a bland, monolithic culture \u2014 \u201cDisneyfication\u201d \u2014 but sometimes the fear to offend instills a kind of civility that other spheres of public life lack. Just compare the inclusive if dull message you hear from corporations with the state of our political culture, where the vilifying of enemies (the elite, welfare queens, the deplorables) is still a critical tool. Donald Trump won an election despite the creepy predatory comments he made on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. But Mr. O\u2019Reilly is being shown the door for acting toward women exactly as Mr. Trump had suggested (\u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d). Not that he needed the encouragement, apparently. Steve King, a five-time congressman from Iowa, has plagued the public arena for years with his barely concealed white nationalism. By contrast, when Donald Sterling, the longtime owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was heard on tape disparaging African-Americans, the N.B.A. revoked his right to ownership and put the team up for auction. The N.B.A. did this even though Mr. Sterling was speaking in private about associates of his ex-girlfriend, who secretly taped him as part of an extortion plot. In the 1980s and \u201990s, companies were more likely to fold under pressure from conservative groups policing the airwaves. \u201cWe are in business to make friends,\u201d said a Coca-Cola spokesman after the company pulled ads from the Fox show \u201cMarried \u2026 With Children.\u201d Today, companies have been pushed in a much more progressive direction, largely because they build their brand on consistent messages not just on television, but also on YouTube and social media. The sheer ubiquity of corporate branding (\u201cJust Do It,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It\u201d) turns consumers into what business scholars call \u201csecondary stakeholders,\u201d people with no financial stake in a company who nevertheless have an interest in the brand. That makes voice a more potent tool. Kellogg\u2019s and Charles Schwab don\u2019t want their ads to appear on a site featuring headlines like \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Crazy and Unattractive\u201d or \u201cOnly Gullible Fools Believe the Great Barrier Reef Is Dying\u201d unless they want to destroy their corporate reputations. Likewise, Mercedes-Benz is a niche brand in the United States, but the company spends millions so that every consumer associates its vehicles with Jon Hamm uttering the phrase \u201cThe best or nothing,\u201d and not with Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s voice telling a would-be conquest that she\u2019s a \u201cwild girl.\u201d (Disclosure: Mr. O\u2019Reilly once called me out on air, saying that I lied about his ratings, and that I didn\u2019t \u201ccare about the truth.\u201d In retrospect, I\u2019m one of the lucky ones.) Boycotts don\u2019t always work, and it wasn\u2019t certain that Mr. Murdoch would agree to kick Mr. O\u2019Reilly to the curb. Don\u2019t forget that he rehired Rebekah Brooks, the disgraced editor of The News of the World, after the phone hacking scandal passed. But on Tuesday yet another woman came forward with allegations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly, and there was the gnawing fear that there were even more to come. More important, 21st Century Fox\u2019s stock has slipped almost 6 percent since the Times investigation was published. That decline would make a coward of almost any chief executive. Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s lawyer is laying the blame for his client\u2019s situation on a \u201csmear campaign\u201d that is \u201cbeing orchestrated by far-left organizations.\u201d That sounds like the kind of all-out political assault that Fox News and Mr. O\u2019Reilly himself excelled at for years. But it wasn\u2019t politics that did in Mr. O\u2019Reilly. It was just business.", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "item_type": "Article"}
