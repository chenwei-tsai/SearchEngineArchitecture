{"text": "LONDON \u2014 A 27-year-old man carrying knives was arrested Thursday afternoon near the Parliament by the London police, who charged him with planning a terrorist attack. No one was hurt, but the episode immediately rekindled anxieties about the terrorist attack outside Parliament on March 22, when a 52-year-old British man, Khalid Masood, drove a vehicle into a group of pedestrians, killing four, and stabbed a police officer to death. The area around Parliament was cordoned off once again on Thursday as armed police officers descended on the scene in a grim routine that has become too familiar in major European cities in recent years. The Metropolitan Police, as the police in London are known, said the man was arrested around 2:22 p.m. after he was stopped and searched in a procedure similar to stop-and-frisk operations in the United States. The arrest took place a short distance from 10 Downing Street, the office and official residence of Prime Minister Theresa May. She was in Derbyshire in central England on Thursday. The man, whose name was not released, was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism, the police said. He was taken to a police station in South London. \u201cDetectives from the Counter Terrorism Command are continuing their investigation, and as a result of this arrest, there is no immediate known threat,\u201d the police said in a statement.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/europe/uk-parliament-arrest.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T12:41:08-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T12:39:54-04:00", "abstract": "The 27-year-old was charged with planning a terrorist attack, rekindling anxiety about the deadly assault on March 22 that was also near Parliament.", "title": "Man Outside U.K. Parliament Carrying Knives Is Arrested"}
