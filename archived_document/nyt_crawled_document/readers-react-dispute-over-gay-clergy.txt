{"text": "Members of the United Methodist Church learned over the weekend that their top court had issued strong rebukes on Friday against three of the church\u2019s regions for allowing openly gay clergy and a bishop to serve. The decisions jolted the global, 13-million-member church, which is intensely divided over gay marriage and gay clergy. The most prominent case involved Bishop Karen P. Oliveto of Denver, a married lesbian and the first openly gay bishop in the Methodist church. She remains a bishop but now faces further legal challenges. The court also ruled that the New York and Northern Illinois regions were wrong not to weed out gay candidates for ministry. We asked Bishop Oliveto, and readers who commented on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page, to share their thoughts about the future of their splintered church. Responses were condensed and edited for clarity. Bishop Karen P. Oliveto, 59, Denver Bishop of Mountain Sky Episcopal Area, including 400 congregations in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and a small part of Idaho I am very grateful that I get to return home to the Mountain Sky area to continue the work we\u2019ve begun there. The decision was confusing and I think it reflects the confusion we have in the church regarding human sexuality in general and the role that L.G.B.T.Q. people have in the life of the church. We\u2019re not of one mind. And instead of offering each other grace, and allowing a difference of opinion to exist, we\u2019ve become more rule-bound, which is creating fractures in the United Methodist Church. I think inherent to United Methodism is a grace that allows for tension of differences to exist. I know there are people that are very upset that I\u2019m a bishop in the church, but I\u2019m committed to being a bishop that cares for them and prays for them and loves them. Because one part of the body of Christ cannot tell another, we have no need of you. There\u2019s a lot of people working very hard to make sure the church is big enough for everyone. And we\u2019re not going anywhere. I would say that if you need to leave for your spiritual care, I understand. But I think there\u2019s a love revolution going on in this church. _____ Scott Faldon, 49, Fort Smith, Ark. Member of Goddard United Methodist Church My great-grandfather was a Methodist preacher, my mother helped found a couple of Methodist churches, and I\u2019ve been a Methodist all my life. A schism has been brewing for a bit now, and this might be the proverbial straw breaking the camel\u2019s back. I just hope we Methodists can find common ground and prevent it from happening. I feel this is very generational. Younger people, and my generation, I don\u2019t think we have that much of a problem with it. But the older generation, the baby boomers, who are still in power in church leadership, they tend to. There are so many churches that skew so much older. For the entire time that I\u2019ve grown up in the church, there have been homosexual members serving in various roles, whether as music leader or Sunday school teacher, or something. So it\u2019s just a matter of admitting that they\u2019ve been a part of the church for decades. There\u2019s no shame in it. They love the Lord and want to serve the Lord and serve their communities. _____ Stacey Sarnicola, 52, Brooklyn Member of Park Slope United Methodist Church The United States and other liberal-minded countries need to split from the African and Asian churches. That is the only resolution I can see. The people in my church have a committee that\u2019s just about going to church conferences and trying to change the policy. Every year they come back disappointed. They\u2019ve been fighting this for the 20 years I\u2019ve been there. Our country is progressing. Most Americans agree with marriage equality and gay rights. So it\u2019s holding us back to be still fighting this. If the United Methodist Church is dwindling in the U.S., that\u2019s why. _____ Lisa Kindervatter, 60, Newtown, Pa. I agree with the Judicial Council\u2019s decisions. Unity of message and doctrine and vision between churches is important because it says, \u201cas Methodists, this is what we believe.\u201d I have never heard the pastor of our church speak about homosexuality from the pulpit. I know his general views from one-on-one conversation, which are in line with the conservative viewpoint that the Bible speaks of homosexuality as a sin. The message is always in the context of love, mercy and grace. Understanding that we all bring sins with us when we come to Jesus \u2026 whether it be bad choices, attitudes, addictions either chemical or sexual. As we confront those things when reading the scriptures, we are taught that yes, we must turn from those things, but He will help us and forgive and heal us. We have about 500 members and four services. New believers, not just transfers, are coming on a weekly basis. _____ Dan Cox, 54, Los Angeles Member of the Hollywood United Methodist Church I have served the Methodist church my entire life with my talents, my time and my financial gifts. As of today, I forever leave behind the Methodist church over this thoughtless, divisive decision by a small group of small-minded leaders. It\u2019s been a really traumatic day. I\u2019m getting emergency emails from my church, from my mother. My own church is even saying our response is to wait and pray. And I\u2019m like, NO. I\u2019ve waited 50 years. I\u2019m tired of waiting until they behave like their religion tells them to. One of the emails from a leader of the conference said if the church has hurt you in the past, then we apologize. It seems to be hurting the L.G.B.T. community even worse now. The first dictate of the church is, spread the good news. We\u2019re actually doing the opposite.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/readers-react-dispute-over-gay-clergy.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T10:52:15-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T10:52:15-04:00", "abstract": "The high court of the United Methodist Church admonished segments of the denomination for allowing clergy and a bishop who are openly gay, further splintering the church.", "title": "Readers React: Dispute Over Gay Clergy"}
