Naomi Watts was decked out in a sleeveless blue sateen dress from Stella McCartney. Gina Gershon had on a black goat-hair bolero and made a beeline for Brooke Shields. Real Housewives hovered, students sketched live falcons, and an accordionist in a top hat serenaded the guests. A little more than a decade ago, this 100-student, two-year graduate program founded in part by Andy Warhol in 1982 seemed as timeworn as the creaky five-floor loft building on Franklin Street in which it has its headquarters. Thanks to tuition fees (now hovering at around $38,000 a year), the academy muddled along, but its expertise was figurative art, which had fallen out of fashion. And it had run into a bit of trouble, including the chief financial officer who turned out to be a career con artist who in 2004 was arrested after reportedly stealing $50,000 from its coffers. Art-world figures were unimpressed with the curriculum. \u201cLots of students painting people in togas, and they weren\u2019t ironic about it,\u201d the artist Eric Fischl said last week. Laurie Simmons, the photographer and filmmaker, added, \u201cA friend of mine who\u2019s a big artist calls it technical masturbation.\u201d So when people like Ms. Shields, Martha Stewart and Jay McInerney arrived on April 3 for its annual spring gala and raised a near-record $860,000, it seemed like a victory tour for the academy\u2019s industrious and socially adept president, David Kratz. For more than an hour, Mr. Kratz, 59, who is silvered-haired and blue-eyed, barely moved from a red carpet on the ground floor. Board members such as Eileen Guggenheim, the academy\u2019s chairwoman, and Alexander Gilkes, a founder of Paddle8, the online auction house, sang his praises. Celebrities ambled up to take photos. Donna Karan cupped his face in her hands. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute; how could you not love him?\u201d she said, as Mr. Kratz\u2019s husband, Greg Unis, smiled brightly. \u201cWe see each other every weekend, because he rides horses in the Hamptons. So I\u2019m used to seeing him at the stable. In full gear.\u201d Alan Cumming told him a ribald story about doing molly before a chance encounter with Jane Fonda: Just before he met her, he began to get \u201call tingly.\u201d Then he accidentally called her \u201cJoan.\u201d\u201cAnd do you know what she said?\u201d Mr. Cumming asked. \u201cShe said, \u2018And what do you do?\u2019\u201d Still, a fundamental question remained: How did a former public relations executive known primarily for working with blue-chip financial companies become such a well-connected art-world player? And if Mr. Kratz, the academy\u2019s president since 2009, has given the place a \u201cnew currency,\u201d as Mr. Fischl asserted, may something bigger be in store for him and the board chairwoman, Ms. Guggenheim? Running a successful arts nonprofit is difficult, even in a boom economy. Public arts funding has been declining. Faculty members and administrators are averse to change. Celebrities rarely give serious money, but benefits get little media coverage without them. For these reasons, it helps to have a guy at the top of a 501(c)(3) who both knows business and has the chutzpah to march up to an Oscar-winning actress at the dog run to ask if she\u2019ll come to a benefit. Which is exactly what Mr. Kratz did with Jennifer Connelly in Brooklyn in 2010, after which she became a fixture at his events. The son of a retail executive, Mr. Kratz grew up on Long Island, attended Dartmouth, received a law degree from Boston University, and did a brief stint at the Wall Street law firm Gould & Wilkie before realizing \u201cthis isn\u2019t for me.\u201d Though Mr. Kratz loved to paint and write, he lacked the confidence to pursue a career in the creative arts, so he chose public relations. One of Mr. Kratz\u2019s first jobs was in the London office of the entertainment public relations firm Rogers & Cowan, where he served as the trans-Atlantic tour guide for Jane Seymour and Zsa Zsa Gabor. At the time, Ms. Gabor was leaving marriage No. 7. \u201cShe said: \u2018My last husband was my divorce lawyer. Now we\u2019re getting divorced. What will I do?\u2019\u201d Mr. Kratz said in a pre-party interview. In 1983, Mr. Kratz founded his own firm, Kratz & Company; big-name clients included Starbucks, Mercedes and IBM. In the mid-1990s, he represented Stoli Vodka at an event at the academy. There he met Ms. Guggenheim, then a board member. The two became pals, and she recruited him to the board, where he served for a year. In 2000, Mr. Kratz sold his company to Havas in a deal estimated to be worth around $10 million. In 2004, he quit his job. With time on his hands and the luxury of not having to worry about the immediate future, he enrolled at the art academy as a student. \u201cI loved it from the minute I walked in,\u201d he said. By then, figurative art was resurgent, thanks to painters such as John Currin, Lisa Yuskavage and Kehinde Wiley. After Mr. Kratz graduated, the board was looking for a new president, and Ms. Guggenheim turned to him. As she saw it, Mr. Kratz knew the place from every angle. Also, she added, \u201cHe\u2019s highly creative, yet he\u2019s fully comfortable with the business end of the job.\u201d Whether there were a ton of prominent philanthropists eager to take over an institution with a $3 million annual budget, Mr. Kratz proved himself, partly by being smart enough to know what he didn\u2019t know. One thing he did was enroll in a course for new presidents of educational institutions at Harvard. Another was reach out to the former Warhol compatriots Jane Holzer and Bob Colacello. Given the academy\u2019s loosey-goosey-where-did-the-money-go history, Mr. Colacello was wary at first. But he came away from lunch with Mr. Kratz impressed. \u201cDavid\u2019s a diplomat, said Mr. Colacello, who was honored by the art academy in 2013. \u201cHe has an ability to move among different worlds and bring them together. He\u2019s as comfortable and supportive of the art students as he is of the professors and teachers and donors. And he has a way of raising funds without being aggressive.\u201d In 2014, charitable contributions surpassed $2 million for the second year in a row, according to the academy\u2019s annual tax filings. (Before Mr. Kratz arrived, the figure was about $300,000 a year.) That year Ms. Simmons was honored at a Tribeca Ball, and gave a speech praising the academy for giving students a technical foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you walk through the studios and see a hundred bowls of fruit, or a thousand vases of flowers and cityscapes,\u201d she said last week. \u201cThere\u2019s really interesting stuff there.\u201d Recently, some have begun to wonder if the ambitious president will soon become restless. Mr. Kratz is not, according to Mr. Fischl \u201cthe best paid person\u201d in nonprofits. And a slew of arts organizations are currently in flux. But Mr. Kratz said he\u2019s not really looking for a museum gig. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I want more time for, and that\u2019s painting,\u201d said Mr. Kratz, whose greatest skill as a salesman is appearing mostly to be unlike a salesman. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m very happy,\u201d he added. \u201cIf something amazing came up, of course I\u2019d consider it, but it\u2019s hard to imagine something more tailored to what I love doing than this.\u201d", "section": "Style", "abstract": "David Kratz, a former public relations executive and trained as a painter, has helped turn the New York Academy of Art into a hot charity.", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T15:48:50-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/style/david-kratz-new-york-academy-of-art-andy-warhol.html", "title": "A Celebrity Party Where Andy Warhol Would Have Fit Right In"}
