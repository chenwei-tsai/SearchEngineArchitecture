{"text": "PARIS \u2014 Marine Le Pen, the far-right French presidential candidate, said on Saturday that she would name a former rival and fellow Euroskeptic as her prime minister if elected, in a new effort to broaden her appeal and defeat her centrist opponent, Emmanuel Macron, in the second round of the country\u2019s elections on May 7. Ms. Le Pen said she had reached an agreement with Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a right-wing politician who shares her distrust of the European Union and globalization and who gathered 4.7 percent of the vote, or nearly 1.7 million ballots, in the election\u2019s first round. Ms. Le Pen gathered 21.3 percent. Ms. Le Pen, sitting with Mr. Dupont-Aignan at a news conference in Paris, praised him as a \u201cpatriot\u201d and said that together they would present a \u201ccommon project\u201d to help them \u201cclaim the patriotic and republican victory that our country needs.\u201d \u201cWe must wrest our country from finance, from submission, from the great whirlwind of globalization that will carry us away if we confront it without knowing how to protect ourselves,\u201d she said. Mr. Dupont-Aignan\u2019s endorsement was first announced on Friday, amid the political fallout of the resignation of the interim leader of the National Front, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party, because of comments he made in 2000 praising a Holocaust denier and expressing doubt that the Nazis used poison gas to murder Jews. Mr. Dupont-Aignan, who heads a right-wing party called Debout La France, or \u201cStand Up, France,\u201d does not bring with him a substantial number of voters, and most of his supporters were already expected to choose Ms. Le Pen in the second round. But it is the first time the National Front has entered into a formal alliance with another political party with the hope of forming a joint government, representing an additional step in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s bid to \u201cun-demonize\u201d the party. Mr. Dupont-Aignan has drawn heavy criticism for his endorsement, especially among politicians on the right who noted his past declarations that his \u201cGaullist\u201d convictions \u2014 meaning his attachment to the political heritage of late president Charles de Gaulle \u2014 were incompatible with an alliance with the National Front. \u201cNicolas Dupont-Aignan is showing his true face, that of betrayal,\u201d the center-right Republican party said in a statement. The Republican candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, did not make it into the second round of the elections, and the party has called on its members to vote against Ms. Le Pen. Ms. Le Pen said the agreement with Mr. Dupont-Aignan had led to \u201cmodifications\u201d in her platform. Mr. Dupont-Aignan mentioned, for instance, a \u201cless systematic\u201d use of import taxes. And in a joint statement on Saturday, the two said that leaving the eurozone was not a \u201cprerequisite to all economic policy,\u201d a softening of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s previous position. Still, the two politicians agree on a vast number of policies, including a hard-line approach to security and an emphasis on the need to increase economic protectionism and to reduce the powers of the European Union, which has become one of the campaign\u2019s major issues. France\u2019s current president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, noted on Saturday that the French election was a \u201cEuropean choice.\u201d \u201cThe choice that is being presented on Sunday, May 7 is to know if the French \u2014 not only globally, but individually \u2014 have to fear an exit from the European Union,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. \u201cThey have everything to gain from remaining in the European Union.\u201d Mr. Macron, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s centrist opponent, said on Saturday that her alliance with Mr. Dupont-Aignan was the sign of a \u201creal clarification in French political life.\u201d \u201cThere is a reactionary, nationalist and anti-European right that has structured itself and that is now an important political force in the second round of this presidential elections,\u201d Mr. Macron said at a campaign event in Usseau, a small town in central France. Mr. Macron, a former investment banker who favors free trade and wants France to remain firmly in the European Union, has a comfortable lead in opinion polls ahead of the runoff. Even if Ms. Le Pen were elected and Mr. Dupont-Aignan were nominated to become prime minister, it is unclear that he would stay in the job for long. Although the president nominates the prime minister, that person must reflect the political majority in the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of Parliament, to avoid a government-toppling motion of censure. But few analysts believe the National Front will gain enough seats in legislative elections in June to obtain a majority, meaning Ms. Le Pen, if elected, could be forced to replace Mr. Dupont-Aignan after those elections.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/world/europe/marine-le-pen-nicolas-dupont-aignan.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T11:59:43-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T11:59:43-04:00", "abstract": "Ms. Le Pen said she had reached an agreement with Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a right-wing politician who shares her distrust of the European Union.", "title": "Marine Le Pen Will Name a Former Rival Prime Minister if Elected"}
