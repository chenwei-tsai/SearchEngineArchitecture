The case concerned a Missouri program to make playgrounds safer that excluded ones affiliated with churches, but it had implications for all kinds of government aid to religious institutions. \u201cThis is a clear burden on a constitutional right,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan said of the exclusion in the playground program. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, the court\u2019s newest member, said the program amounted to \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of religious status.\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the most consistent voice on the other side, though she seemed to be in the minority. \u201cThey\u2019re just saying,\u201d she said of the state, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to be involved with a church.\u201d The question in the case, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, No. 15-577, is whether officials in Missouri were entitled to reject an application from a Lutheran church for a grant to use recycled tires to resurface a playground. The Missouri Constitution bars spending public money \u201cdirectly or indirectly, in aid of any church,\u201d and the state Supreme Court has called for \u201ca very high wall between church and state.\u201d David A. Cortman, a lawyer for the church, said it sought only to protect children of all faiths from injury and could not use the rubber in its religious work. He argued that the state Constitution violated equal protection principles and the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free exercise of religion. \u201cAll we\u2019re talking about is a safer surface for children as they play,\u201d he said. James R. Layton, a lawyer for the state, said it should have leeway to decide for itself whether and how much to help religious groups, and he noted that the program was a selective one. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in a position where we are choosing among churches,\u201d he said. A 2004 Supreme Court decision, Locke v. Davey, allowed Washington State to offer college scholarships to all students except those pursuing a degree in devotional theology. Mr. Cortman said that case involved direct support for religion. Playgrounds, he argued, were a different matter. The justices considered a last-minute wrinkle in the case. Last week, Gov. Eric Greitens of Missouri, a Republican, announced a change in state policy. The state would no longer discriminate against religious groups in evaluating grant applications for programs like the one at issue in the case, he said. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this case moot?\u201d Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked. Lawyers on both sides said the development did not make the case moot because Mr. Greitens or the next governor could reverse course. \u201cThe political winds could change,\u201d Mr. Cortman said. Mr. Layton echoed the point, though he noted that he had been asked to defend a position the state no longer holds. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in January 2016, not long before Justice Antonin Scalia died. Apparently fearing a deadlock, it waited more than a year to schedule arguments, an exceptionally long time. With the arrival this week of Justice Gorsuch, the court is now back at full strength.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/us/politics/supreme-court-church-state.html", "section": "U.S.", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "The case, one of several Justice Neil M.
