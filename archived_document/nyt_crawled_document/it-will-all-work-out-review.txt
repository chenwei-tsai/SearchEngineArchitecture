Mr. Wells is a writer, an actor and a high priest of the monthly artist be-in Secret City. Possibly, he has met a mantle or a poncho he didn\u2019t long to swirl around his shoulders; it seems unlikely. In \u201cIt Will All Work Out,\u201d a wobbly, bighearted, cloak-and-chatter show at Dixon Place, Mr. Wells narrates tales from his life while modeling a series of whirling, spangled outfits. Mr. Wells has a head like a goateed Easter egg and a jolly, florid persona that jazzes up even ordinary stories, as do a groovy live band and lissome backup singers. Striding around in platform boots, he describes falling for theater as a small-town teenager, wrecking a car on the freeway, receiving an unorthodox Koreatown massage. None of these yarns are especially outlandish or weighty, but Mr. Wells imbues them with delight and consequence, mostly by announcing his own amazement: \u201cThey let me sing the whole song!\u201d \u201cI slowly veered across all four lanes of traffic!\u201d \u201cI love a steam room!\u201d At a preview performance, the prose still seemed in flux, as did the lyrics to the playful songs, written with the bandleader Jeremy Bass. A couple of times, Mr. Wells cracked up as he mangled a line. \u201cWe didn\u2019t actually drink Santa,\u201d he told Mr. Bass. Then he sang that it was \u201cTime to get new school holes.\u201d Under Elise Laytner\u2019s direction, there\u2019s too little Lurex thread connecting the various stories. But however shaky the show\u2019s organization and execution, Mr. Wells\u2019s enthusiastic sweetness twinkles through. And in a moment in which each morning\u2019s headlines promise new catastrophe, a title and a theme like \u201cIt Will All Work Out\u201d feel pretty welcome. Apparently, it really has all worked out for Mr. Wells. In the course of the show, he lands a cheap apartment in Chelsea and someone to share it with. They\u2019re marrying in the fall. How\u2019s that for happily ever after?", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00"}
