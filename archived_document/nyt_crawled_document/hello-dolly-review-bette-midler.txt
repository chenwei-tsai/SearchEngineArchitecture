No, you\u2019ll have to get yourself and your wide-open wallet to the Shubert Theater, where the savory spectacle of Bette Midler eating turns out to be the culinary event of the year. Ms. Midler \u2014 who opened in the title role of \u201cHello, Bette!,\u201d I mean \u201cHello, Dolly!,\u201d on Thursday night \u2014 not only knows how to make a meal out of a juicy part; she knows how to make a meal out of a meal. In the second act of this exceedingly bright and brassy revival, Ms. Midler can be found sitting alone at a table, slowly and deliberately polishing off the remnants of an expensive dinner, from a turkey bone dipped in gravy to a multitude of dumplings, while the rest of the cast freezes in open-mouthed amazement. Ms. Midler brings such comic brio \u2014 both barn-side broad and needlepoint precise \u2014 to the task of playing with her food that I promise you it stops the show. Then again, pretty much everything Ms. Midler does stops the show. As for that much anticipated moment when she puts on fire-engine red plumes and sequins to lead a cakewalk of singing waiters, well, let\u2019s just hope that this show\u2019s producers have earthquake insurance. Back on a Broadway stage in a book musical for the first time (can it be?) since \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d half a century ago, Ms. Midler is generating a succession of seismic responses that make Trump election rallies look like Quaker prayer meetings. Her audiences, of course, are primed for Ms. Midler to give them their money\u2019s worth in Jerry Zaks\u2019s revival of this 1964 portrait of a human steamroller out to land a rich husband in 19th-century New York. The show was a scalper\u2019s delight from the moment tickets went on sale. But Ms. Midler isn\u2019t coasting on the good will of theatergoers who remember her as the queen of 1980s movie comedies or as the bawdy earth goddess of self-satirizing revues from the \u201970s onward. As the center and raison d\u2019\u00eatre of this show, which also features David Hyde Pierce in a springtime-fresh cartoon of the archetypal grumpy old man, Ms. Midler works hard for her ovations, while making you feel that the pleasure is all hers. In the process she deftly shoves the clamorous memories of Carol Channing (who created the role on Broadway) and Barbra Streisand (in the 1969 film) at least temporarily into the wings. The show as a whole \u2014 which has been designed by Santo Loquasto to resemble a bank of Knickerbocker-themed, department store Christmas windows \u2014 could benefit from studying how its star earns her laughs and our love. Playing the pushiest of roles, the endlessly enterprising matchmaker Dolly Levi, Ms. Midler never pushes for effect. Her every bit of shtick has been precisely chosen and honed, and rather than forcing it down our throats, she makes us come to her to admire it. Much of the rest of Mr. Zaks\u2019s production charges at us like a prancing elephant, festooned in shades of pink. This is true of the hot pastels of Mr. Loquasto\u2019s sets and costumes, and of Warren Carlyle\u2019s athletic golden-age-of-musicals choreography, which is both expert and exhausting. When an onstage laugh is called for, it comes out as a deafening cackle or a guffaw, which is then stretched and repeated. Double takes, grins and grimaces are magnified into crushing largeness, while the chase sequences bring to mind slap-happy Blake Edwards comedies. Even reliably charming performers like Gavin Creel and Kate Baldwin, who play the plot\u2019s supporting lovers (with Taylor Trensch and Beanie Feldstein as their second bananas), seem under the impression they\u2019re in a Mack Sennett farce. My audience couldn\u2019t have been more tickled by these hard-sell tactics, which hew closely to Gower Champion\u2019s original staging. A tone of sunny desperation isn\u2019t out of keeping with what seems to be this production\u2019s escapist mission, which is to deliver nostalgia with an exclamation point. Featuring a book by Michael Stewart and a tenaciously wriggling earworm of a score by Jerry Herman (given gleaming orchestral life here), \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d is a natural vehicle for rose-colored remembrance. It was adapted from Thornton Wilder\u2019s play \u201cThe Matchmaker,\u201d which grew out of his \u201cThe Merchant of Yonkers,\u201d itself adapted from an 1842 Austrian reworking of an 1835 American one-acter. With its folksy wisdom and air of life-affirming wonder, Wilder\u2019s script translated fluently into the hyperbole of a big song-and-dance show, which spoke (loudly) not only of a more innocent age of American history but also of a time when musicals were upbeat spectacles, with outsize stars to match. (Ms. Channing was succeeded by a cavalcade of divas, from Ethel Merman to Pearl Bailey.) Don\u2019t forget that \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d opened just two months after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, when the United States felt anything but united. The genius of casting Ms. Midler as Dolly, a widow who decides to rejoin life by marrying the rich and curmudgeonly Horace Vandergelder (Mr. Pierce), is that she built her career on making nostalgia hip. Even when she was sassing and strutting for the gay boys at the Continental Baths in her youth (when the original \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d was still on the boards, she was channeling entertainers from the days of burlesque. With Ms. Midler, such hommages were never merely camp. She exuded bone-deep affection and respect for vaudeville stylings, in which impeccably controlled artifice became a conduit for sentimentality as well as rowdy humor. That affinity pervades every aspect of her Dolly, which is less a fluid performance than a series of calculated gestures that somehow coalesce into a seamless personality. Consider, for starters, her hydraulic walk, made up of short, chugging steps. (A real train materializes for the big \u201cPut On Your Sunday Clothes\u201d number, but Ms. Midler is the real locomotive wonder.) Or her take-charge New Yawk accent, spiced with the insinuating inflections of Sophie Tucker. Or her stylized collapse into exhaustion in the middle of the title song. Without stripping gears, she makes fast switches from explosive comedy to a sober emotionalism that never cloys. (Her pop hits, you may remember, include the weepy \u201cWind Beneath My Wings.\u201d) And her final scenes with Mr. Pierce, who delivers a beautifully drawn caricature (and is rewarded with a solo that was cut from the original), may leave you with tears in your eyes without your quite understanding why. Ms. Midler\u2019s talents have never included a conventionally pretty voice. Yet when she rasps out the anthem \u201cBefore the Parade Passes By,\u201d you hear her voice as that of a nightingale. And when she hikes up her period skirts to shuffle her feet, she gives the impression she\u2019s dancing up a storm. She\u2019s not, of course. (Her kicks in her big numbers are only from the knees.) But a great star performance is at least 50 percent illusion, conjured by irresistible will power and cunning. Ms. Midler arranges her component parts with the seductive insistence with which Dolly Levi arranges other people\u2019s lives. After two acts of fending off Dolly\u2019s charms, Horace finds himself proclaiming, in happy defeat, \u201cWonderful woman!\u201d Nobody is about to argue with him.", "abstract": "In this rose-colored revival of the 1964 war horse \u201cHello, Dolly!,\u201d Bette Midler provides a dazzling lesson in star power", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T22:13:48-04:00", "title": "Review: \u2018Hello, Dolly!\u2019 Is Bright, Brassy and All Bette", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/theater/hello-dolly-review-bette-midler.html"}
