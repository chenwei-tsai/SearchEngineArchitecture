{"text": "DARWIN, Australia \u2014 South Korea, Japan and the United States have grown accustomed to North Korea\u2019s diatribes, but Pyongyang recently threatened a new target with a nuclear strike: Australia. During a visit by Vice President Mike Pence to Sydney, the North warned Australia to think twice about \u201cblindly and zealously toeing the U.S. line\u201d and acting as \u201ca shock brigade of the U.S. master.\u201d Australian and American troops have fought side by side in every major conflict since World War I, and there are few militaries in the world with closer relations: 1,250 United States Marines recently arrived in Darwin for six months of joint exercises; the two countries share intelligence from land, sea and even outer space; and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is slated to meet President Trump on Thursday on an aircraft carrier in New York. But North Korea\u2019s threat against the country, far-fetched as it might seem, is an example of how Australia\u2019s most important military alliance faces a new challenge: the risk that President Trump will draw the nation into a conflict or other unexpected crisis that destabilizes the region, angers its trading partners or forces it to side with either the United States or China. \u201cThe question is: What might America drag Australia into?\u201d said Ashley Townshend, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney. \u201cThat\u2019s a very scary thought for Australians, many of whom perceive Donald Trump to be an erratic and highly self-interested commander in chief.\u201d Mr. Trump has already embarrassed Australia once, with an abrupt phone call to Mr. Turnbull that seemed to dismiss Australia\u2019s historic role as a friend who often gives more than it gets. Now his unpredictable approach is fueling a national debate about Australia\u2019s relationship with the world, and especially the United States. Last week, Paul Keating, a prime minister during the Clinton years, reignited discussion by arguing that Australia must end its status as a \u201cclient state.\u201d Australia is essentially caught between two powers: China, its largest trading partner, and the United States, its faithful ally, with a military connection that has been strengthened by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and more recent agreements to gradually expand the American footprint in Darwin. What Australia and the United States are now trying to work out is how to manage that military momentum in an increasingly tense part of the world. If the military is a hammer in the Trump era, at what point does every dispute start to look like a nail? \u201cIt\u2019s always important that there\u2019s a balance between the military and the diplomatic \u2014 because of the scale of the military,\u201d Mr. Keating said in an interview. \u201cIn both economic terms and in strategic terms, they squeeze diplomacy out.\u201d Darwin, a humid, crocodile-infested coastal city at the northern end of this vast country, captures the past, present and future of Australia\u2019s alliance with the United States. Japan attacked the city on Feb. 19, 1942, killing 235 people, and residents are quick to point out that the raids were led by the same commander responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor 10 weeks earlier. Within a few months, Darwin became a hub for counterstrikes from bombers flown by Americans. A pocket guide for arriving American troops set the tone: \u201cYou\u2019re going to meet a people who like Americans and whom you will like.\u201d During the Cold War, the relationship expanded. Kim Beazley, a former defense minister and ambassador to the United States, cited the rise during the 1960s of three joint installations to maintain contact with American submarines in the Indian Ocean and provide infrared detection of Soviet capabilities, increasing the warning time for a potential Soviet strike to 30 minutes from 15. Those installations and the ones that followed \u2014 especially Pine Gap, a joint Australian-American spy base that helps provide battlefield intelligence and early warnings for missile launches around the world \u2014 \u201care never talked about, but they\u2019re really the guts of the alliance,\u201d Mr. Beazley said. On the ground in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, Australian troops are also peers in battle, said Lt. Col. Brian S. Middleton, commanding officer of the Third Battalion, Fourth Marines \u2014 the American unit that just moved into Darwin for six months of training with the Australians. As part of the American pivot to Asia, the long-term plan, negotiated under the Obama administration, is to send up to 2,500 Marines to Darwin \u2014 the largest deployment of United States forces to Australia since World War II. \u201cIt\u2019ll make us more effective in whatever conflict we end up serving in together,\u201d said Kelly Magsamen, the Pentagon\u2019s top Asia-Pacific policy official at the end of the Obama administration. Other American officials said that in space, missile defense and cyberwarfare, the Australians are all in. Australia is working with the United States to relocate a special radar that helps better track satellites. The Australian military is also making a big push in innovation in undersea warfare and drones in the air and underwater. And in many cases, that means purchases of American equipment. An Australian defense planning report last year laid out a $20 billion increase in the annual military budget by 2025, including money for fighter jets, surveillance technology, submarines, surface ships and other equipment. Australians are embedded at every level of the American military. Australian Air Commodore Phillip Champion\u2019s story is common: He first worked with the Americans as a young pilot in the early \u201980s, flying surveillance aircraft, and later as a commander all over the world, including Afghanistan. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown up together,\u201d he said in an interview by phone from Hawaii, where he has been posted to the United States Pacific Command since January. \u201cWe trust each other and know we can operate together.\u201d Still, there have been challenges. In a discussion last year about the cost of the Marines in Darwin, the Australians came in with a data-heavy presentation asserting that United States Marines eat more than typical Australian soldiers, and therefore strain sewage systems more, and argued that the Americans should pay more of the costs of improving wastewater lines on military bases. The proposal stunned even the lead Australian negotiators, who quickly dropped it, according to American defense officials. The toughest issues have involved China, the crucial lever of influence with North Korea and the region. Some American officials have urged Australia to engage in robust freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, where China has set up bases on disputed islands, but the Australians have resisted. Last year, American officials also expressed alarm about a port in Darwin that local officials leased to a Chinese company for $361 million, possibly making it easier to collect intelligence on American and Australian forces stationed nearby. \u201cChina is the elephant in the room for both of us,\u201d Ms. Magsamen said. \u201cWe need to have a more frank and structured discussion amongst ourselves about how to manage that relationship.\u201d Allan Gyngell, who ran Australia\u2019s intelligence agency from 2009 to 2013, argues in a new book, \u201cFear of Abandonment,\u201d that Australia\u2019s foreign policy is still driven by worries about being left isolated, without the promise of security from a powerful friend: first Britain, now the United States. Mr. Keating, the former prime minister, is among those urging a more independent foreign policy in which Australia accepts China as the region\u2019s dominant power. In the discussion last week at the Lowy Institute, a think tank in Sydney, Mr. Keating said Australia should say no to the United States more often \u2014 as France and Canada do \u2014 especially on issues that affect Australia\u2019s relationship with China. Those who reject this argument include John Howard, the prime minister who followed Mr. Keating and was in Washington on Sept. 11, 2001. In an interview at his modest office, with worn carpets and military memorabilia, Mr. Howard warned against being \u201cmesmerized by China\u201d and said his Liberal Party, which is the more conservative of the country\u2019s two largest parties, had \u201cpulled off the daily double.\u201d \u201cWe deepened our relationship with the U.S. \u2014 and China became our biggest customer,\u201d he said. He added that too many Australians were jumping to conclusions about President Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s different,\u201d Mr. Howard said. \u201cWhether he\u2019s good different or bad different is not the point; the world has to get used to him.\u201d In Darwin too, there are divisions. Luke Bowen, who heads an economic development agency for the Northern Territory, which includes Darwin, would like to see even more American troops and equipment move in to the area, possibly from the Philippines. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for us to make the fit as comfortable as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the Australian presence. It\u2019s about the combined presence.\u201d But Justin Tutty, who works with a watchdog group that monitors the impact of the American Marines, said he was worried about \u201ca one-sided relationship\u201d in which the Americans lay out the priorities. \u201cThe overinvestment in \u2018interoperability\u2019 ties us closer to our larger foreign partner\u2019s attack formation, and reduces our capacity to act, relate and think independently,\u201d he said. Last week for Anzac Day, commemorating Australians and New Zealanders who died in battle, American Marines and Australian soldiers marched through Darwin\u2019s streets together. Later, there were friendly games of rugby, and infantrymen shared war stories. \u201cThe Australians have been fighting in the same places we\u2019ve fought for over 100 years,\u201d said Colonel Middleton of the Marines. \u201cWhen we operate with the Australians, we learn as much from them as they learn from us.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/world/australia/trump-north-korea-us-china.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T15:42:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T15:42:24-04:00", "abstract": "Some in Australia worry about the risk of being drawn into a conflict that forces it to side with either the United States, its military ally, or China, its biggest trading partner.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Volatility in Asia Distresses a Longtime U.S. Ally: Australia"}
