{"text": "When my boyfriend, Mike DiPasquale, asked me to move in with him after two years of dating, I was thrilled. Even though I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I was signing up for. Just the prospect of no longer needing to keep two bottles of contact lens solution, two toothbrushes and two sticks of deodorant in two separate homes was enough to have me jumping for joy. Visions of plush rugs, soft lighting and cuddling in front of a fireplace filled my head. I quickly realized that I was confusing coffee commercials with real life. The truth is: Living together before you\u2019re married is a big step legally, financially and emotionally. Friends and family didn\u2019t give me much practical advice before I moved into Mike\u2019s condo, a third-floor studio inside a former South Philadelphia Catholic elementary school. His mother attended school here in the early 1960s; we boil pasta, play video games and take showers in what was once her seventh-grade classroom. My mother gave us a $100 gift certificate to Crate and Barrel, but she didn\u2019t tell me what to anticipate. I Googled \u201cMoving in with your boyfriend,\u201d but the search results landed with a thud. The advice was dry and didn\u2019t speak to my concerns: How do I know if I\u2019m picking a compatible person to move in with? What if he\u2019s annoyed by my hourlong phone calls with my sister, the sweatpants I wear around the house, or the insane amount of hair I shed on every available surface? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more Americans than ever are choosing to live together before marriage. And the Pew Research Center says more than half of all women aged 19 to 44 who marry for the first time have lived with their husbands before walking down the aisle. Unmarried millennials are more likely to live with their partners than any previous generation at this stage in their lives. It\u2019s clear why couples find cohabitation so appealing. Aside from the convenience it affords, the prospect of splitting rent and utility bills is too seductive to pass up. Add in a desire to shed roommates and a reluctance to renew a pricey lease, and you can see why plenty of couples choose cohabitation, even if they aren\u2019t exactly sure what comes next. I was so focused on the elation of moving in with Mike that I didn\u2019t even consider what would happen if our relationship went down in flames. We had never discussed who would stay in the condo, who would take possession of the Passat we leased together, or which one of us would get to keep our three-legged cat, Eleanor. Turns out we\u2019re not alone. Most couples don\u2019t take the time to walk through the financial and legal implications of cohabitation beforehand. According to leading legal and financial experts, that\u2019s a major mistake and a missed opportunity. Frederick Hertz, author of \u201cLiving Together: A Legal Guide for Unmarried Couples,\u201d says the first step toward moving in together is to figure out what will happen should you part ways: \u201cYou can either plan your breakup in a civilized, caring, thoughtful way, or you can try to avoid it and have it be a nasty fight later on.\u201d If you are renting or own a home, figure out who will stay in the event of a breakup. Nail down who will pay any pesky fees or taxes. Come up with a plan. In light of this practical advice, I pushed Mike to discuss what would happen if we should break up. Initially, he was reluctant to discuss the possibility. He said he\u2019d be so devastated that he would start a new life from scratch. While I appreciated the drama of his response, we still needed to develop a road map. Since Mike had owned his condo before we started dating, we agreed he should continue to live in it. I volunteered to move in with my parents until I found a more permanent place. I\u2019d keep the Passat and pay the remaining payments on the lease. And Eleanor would stay with me. (I was thrilled I could keep the cat, but I didn\u2019t want to cheer too loudly.) After we settled on the details of our dissolution, we gave each other a long hug. Pam Friedman, a marital financial expert and author of \u201cI Now Pronounce You Financially Fit,\u201d agrees that the biggest mistake couples make is moving in together before having these candid talks. She advises couples to be honest about their fears and insecurities and meet them head on: What happens if we break up? Or get sick? Or die? Some unmarried couples might benefit from a cohabitation agreement, also known as a no-nup, a legal agreement about who gets what in the event of a breakup or major life event. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think five steps ahead,\u201d Ms. Friedman said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no fun at first. Then it becomes a project you can work on together.\u201d Apart from thorny financial and legal concerns, cohabitation creates a new set of emotional constraints for couples as well.  Galena Rhoades, a professor and researcher who studies cohabitation at the University of Denver, calls it a \u201csandwich period,\u201d when people juggle dating and marriage issues concurrently. \u201cWhen you live together,\u201d Dr. Rhoades explained, \u201cyou face all the issues dating couples face \u2014 time together, managing friends, jealousy, ex-partners \u2014 but you also face all the issues married couples face, like household contributions, managing money together and planning for future expenditures.\u201d It can be an especially risky undertaking if the couple immediately goes from a long-distance relationship to cohabitation. Katie Leggett and Allen Hotchkiss did just that. The couple dated for over a year while Ms. Leggett lived in the West Village and Mr. Hotchkiss lived in Chicago. Then they moved into an apartment together in Park Slope, Brooklyn. \u201cWe knew we could get more bang for our buck if we just took the plunge and moved in together when my lease was up, versus getting separate studios, or dealing with roommates for another year in our late 20s,\u201d Ms. Leggett said. \u201cIt was definitely an adjustment.\u201d \u201cThere were very few surprises upon moving in with each other,\u201d Mr. Hotchkiss recalled. \u201cTalking about all of the possible \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios is the only way to make sure living together is the right move.\u201d A self-confessed Type A germophobe, Ms. Leggett follows a strict set of rules: No shoes in the house and no clothes that have been worn on the subways on the bed. She showers twice a day. Mr. Hotchkiss is more laid back. \u201cFor me, it was about picking the right battles and respecting Katie\u2019s key points of contention, like taking my shoes off at the door or not wearing my \u2018subway clothes\u2019 on the bed,\u201d Mr. Hotchkiss said. This willingness to meet in the middle eased the transition considerably. Mike and I slid into certain habits when it came to chores. I\u2019m happiest food shopping, cooking meals and emptying the dishwasher. Mike prefers washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making the bed and taking out the trash. The key, says Jolie Kerr, Esquire\u2019s cleaning advice columnist and host of the podcast \u201cAsk a Clean Person,\u201d is to treat each other as teammates rather than adversaries: \u201cYou play to each other\u2019s strengths.\u201d We were happy to assign chores based on whoever expressed more enthusiasm. However it quickly became evident that our cleanliness standards are wildly different. Mike can spot a sesame seed five yards away, and he folds his T-shirts into precise, flat squares. I leave a trail of crumbs in my wake, and my clothes are not so much folded as herded into a vague rectangle. We had to adjust our standards. I\u2019m learning to sweep up my errant crumbs, and he\u2019s learning to live with a little chaos. And I knew Mike detested clutter, but we didn\u2019t have any discussions about how we would adjust his 874-square-foot space to fit both our physical needs. Apparently, this lack of conversation around design is also very common. Sheena Murphy, a founder and designer at a Brooklyn-based design studio called Sheep and Stone, encourages partners to be explicit about their expectations and boundaries: \u201cOne of the biggest things people don\u2019t do is talk about living together, what that means and how you\u2019re going to set up your home.\u201d After a year of dating, Armando Morales and Annie Simeone decided it was silly for them both to be paying New York City rents, especially since hers was twice what he paid. Last June they figured they could make it work in Mr. Morales\u2019s apartment in Ridgewood, Queens, pending a drastic reworking of the space. Fortunately, Ms. Simeone works as a production designer for film and television. She created a rendering of the apartment and its furniture layout using a three-dimensional modeling program, which allowed her to envision various floor plans. Mr. Morales crafted custom shelving so they could save even more space. \u201cWe have a classic New York railroad, with a kitchen on one end and the bedroom on the other. In between is an office and a living room,\u201d Mr. Morales said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for a couple in that you can be together but also have separate space when you need it.\u201d Another reason couples choose to cohabitate is to spend more time together. It\u2019s been interesting to see how Mike and I use that time. Like most modern couples, we are never far away from our cellphones. We\u2019re quick to browse social media at the slightest lull in conversation. I prefer to scroll through Facebook while he\u2019s more of a Twitter guy. Over time, I sensed that our willingness to plug in (and ignore each other) was affecting the quality of our interactions.  Christine Carter, author of \u201cThe Sweet Spot\u201d and \u201cRaising Happiness,\u201d sees this play out in plenty of couples. She recommends setting ground rules for technology usage and minimizing double-screen time, as she calls it. If you\u2019re doing something mindless with your partner, like watching TV, just focus on that. Don\u2019t also check your work email, play Candy Crush or do anything else to draw your attention away from each other. \u201cYour partner can be a source of deep and lasting joy, connection, meaning, fulfillment,\u201d Dr. Carter said. \u201cYour phone cannot.\u201d In the end, some of my initial concerns proved silly. Mike doesn\u2019t mind that I shed like Mr. Snuffleupagus in August. When I conduct marathon phone calls with my sister, he catches up on his social media apps. He\u2019s happy to scrub the toilet, as long as I clean the shower. We are stronger for taking this step and navigating our sandwich phase \u2014 this premarriage, postdating bubble \u2014 with clear eyes. Having those difficult talks about our finances and being more mindful of the space we share, the chores we perform and the habits we cultivate, we\u2019re well on our way to creating a happy home. After living together for two years \u2014 and after countless loads of laundry and a dizzying number of dishwasher cycles \u2014 Mike and I tied the knot on April 21, 2017.
