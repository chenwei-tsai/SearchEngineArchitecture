{"text": "Here are the week\u2019s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. We are 101 days into President Trump\u2019s term, and the first 100 weren\u2019t as he had hoped. Mr. Trump pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act before the symbolic milepost, but Republicans couldn\u2019t rally support in last-minute negotiations. Despite unified Republican governance, it was one of the least productive introductory periods for a president in recent times. Our reporters shared their most vivid memories from the period. And New York is bracing for the president\u2019s first return to the city on Thursday. ____ 2. President Trump chose not to attend the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner on Saturday, instead holding a campaign-style rally in Harrisburg, Pa., at which he savaged the news media. The journalists\u2019 event in Washington went on without him, along with the \u201cNot the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner,\u201d hosted by the comedian Samantha Bee. Ms. Bee and Hasan Minhaj, the featured performer at the official dinner, both celebrated the First Amendment but also took sharp aim at journalists and the president they cover. ____ 3. There\u2019s still much to be learned about President Trump\u2019s tax plan. A one-sheet proposal released on Wednesday was light on details, but trillions would be diverted to the country\u2019s richest families, including his own. Learn how the proposed changes are likely to affect you individually. ____ 4. A North Korean missile launch on Saturday ended in failure, the second consecutive failure in two weeks. A United States official said the missile \u201cdid not pose a threat to North America.\u201d Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said the United States was keeping \u201call options\u201d open if diplomacy failed. Parsing President Trump\u2019s strategy can be difficult, but he appears to be reverting to an old habit of sounding as tough as the other guy. Pope Francis, for one, called for the countries to ease tensions. Elsewhere, satellite images, posts on social media and eyewitness accounts reveal how Russia and Syria distorted the facts of a chemical attack. ____ 5. Domestic violence victims who are undocumented immigrants face a harrowing choice: Which do they fear more, the abuser or the government? Reports of domestic violence and rape have dropped among immigrants, some of whom believe they could be detained and deported if they press charges. One lawyer said she used to tell undocumented immigrants that officers would protect them, but not anymore. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve ever told our clients is out the window,\u201d she said. ____ 6. Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Washington on Saturday demanded action on climate change. They let out a roar at the White House gates, meant to symbolically drown out climate change deniers. The march came one day after President Trump signed an executive order to roll back safety regulations on offshore drilling. He also won a small, but perhaps temporary, legal victory related to President Barack Obama\u2019s clean energy policy. ____ 7. The first statistical snapshot of the United States economy in 2017 wasn\u2019t pretty. The economy grew at just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, a sharp decline from 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2016. It was the worst quarterly performance in three years. Ahead this week: Apple earnings are announced on Tuesday, and the Federal Reserve will decide on Wednesday whether to raise interest rates. ____ 8. The N.F.L. draft was highlighted by a slew of surprises in the first round. The event was transformed into an outdoor spectacle, but the league is seeing  worrisome trends under the surface. Elsewhere, the N.B.A. and N.H.L. playoffs continue this week. And stock up for your favorite mint julep recipe, because the Kentucky Derby is coming up on Saturday. ____ 9. Concertgoers in the Bahamas were promised a weekend of luxury and access to major musical acts at the Fyre Festival. Instead, they found chaos, soggy tents and cheese sandwiches. \u201cNot one thing that was promised on the website was delivered,\u201d said one visitor who paid $3,500 for a deluxe \u201clodge\u201d package but ended up in a tent encampment. The rapper Ja Rule, one of the festival\u2019s founders, said on Twitter: \u201cI truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT\u2026 but I\u2019m taking responsibility.\u201d ____ ____ 10. And now, a little news for your couch. Our TV critic has suggestions for what to watch based on how much free time you have this weekend. You might consider rewatching \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d which returns in May on Showtime, or honoring Jonathan Demme, the filmmaker who died on Wednesday. If you get through the first episodes of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d here are some fascinating articles about it. ____ 11.  We\u2019ve also scouted the internet for some of the best partisan writing from the right and the left so you can see how the other side thinks. Or, if you\u2019d prefer, you could dig into 12 great stories that have nothing to do with politics, including what makes some mushrooms glow in the dark. And our obituary of Florence Finch, an unsung hero of World War II, is one of our best-read stories this week. ____ 12. School choice in Washington has not raised student achievement and may have worsened it, according to an Education Department report. The report, which was well underway before the 2016 election, comes as Betsy DeVos, the department\u2019s secretary, and President Trump press Congress to devote hundreds of millions of dollars to voucher programs. Though a sizable study, researchers cautioned against using the results in a case for or against national programs. ____ 13. Finally, we bring you an alternative health care plan that could make your skin crawl, but would definitely crawl on your skin. Leeches are still frequently prescribed as a preventive treatment for stroke and heart disease in Russia, typically costing $1 a pop. You\u2019ll probably need three to seven of them for a 30- to 40-minute session. \u201cAfter you go through it, you understand there is nothing to worry about,\u201d one patient said. Thanks for reading, and we hope you have a worry-free week. Your Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.
