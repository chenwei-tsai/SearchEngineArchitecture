{"text": "So the threats were no more than bluster, and all is well. That is one view of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy at the 100-day-or-so mark. Wrong. Yes, there\u2019s no sign of the Wall, and NATO is no longer \u201cobsolete,\u201d and the Iran nuclear deal is still in place, and the \u201cOne China\u201d policy has not been scrapped, and the Iran nuclear agreement endures despite Trump\u2019s dismissal of it as \u201cthe worst deal ever,\u201d and the United States embassy is still in Tel Aviv, and neither the Paris climate deal nor the North American Free Trade Agreement has been abandoned. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, have ring-fenced Trump\u2019s recklessness and bellicosity. They have neutralized his ignorance even if nobody can help the president grasp its extent. Some of the loonier members of the president\u2019s entourage have been fired or marginalized. Adults have taken charge. There is still a lot of noise, but \u201cAmerica First\u201d has not upended the world. Except that it has. A disaster is unfolding whose consequences for humanity and decency will be devastating. The United States under Trump has embarked on a valueless foreign policy. The president has not met a strongman whose machismo does not beguile him. He prefers guns to diplomats. Militarism and mercantilism constitute a new policy, unconstrained by any consideration of what the United States stands for in the world or the values its alliances have defended since 1945. This is a radical departure. America is also an idea. That idea is inextricable \u2014 whatever the country\u2019s conspicuous failings \u2014 from the defense of liberty, democracy, human rights, open societies and the rule of law. Realist, neoconservative and liberal internationalist schools have different interpretations of how this may be achieved, and what limits exist on America\u2019s capacity to extend the reach of freedom. But the unblushing, public embrace of the torturer for mutual gain does not appear in any pre-Trump foreign policy manual I know. A \u201cvery friendly\u201d conversation with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines leads to a White House invitation for a man accused of waging a brutal extrajudicial drug war. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey cements his repressive and increasingly imperious rule in a dubious referendum and gets a congratulatory call from Trump. The red carpet rolls out for Egypt\u2019s autocratic president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who becomes Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat friend.\u201d President Xi Jinping of China goes from currency manipulator to \u201cterrific person\u201d and seems to inspire in Trump an embarrassing awe. President Vladimir Putin of Russia, having been lumped early on with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as somebody Trump may or may not be able to trust, basks still in Trump\u2019s agnosticism on brutality. The message is clear: The United States has granted carte blanche for despots. Whatever brutality Trump\u2019s autocrat-friends inflict on human beings, whatever contempt they have for a free press or the rule of law, is no longer an American concern. Of course, the United States has allied with ruthless strongmen before; Stalin was one. But Trump\u2019s moral abdication, divorced from any coherent strategic objective, has ushered America into new territory. This is not effective foreign policy realism; it is a form of depravity. And what of the military muscle flexing? The Tomahawk cruise missiles fired on a Syrian airfield in response to President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons was the right response years too late but became a meaningless gesture because it was divorced from any strategy to increase pressure on Assad. A big bomb on Afghanistan also looked, in the end, more like showmanship than anything. In North Korea, there\u2019s another showman with hair: Kim Jong-un (whom Trump says he\u2019d be \u201chonored\u201d to meet). Trump\u2019s brinkmanship with him has succeeded so far in being at once dangerous and ineffective. What matters to this president is the news cycle, not strategy or principle. The toll is considerable. France and Germany are no longer asking themselves whether they have been cast loose between a hostile Moscow and a hostile Washington, as they did in the first weeks of the Trump administration, but nor have they forgotten the experience. The suspicion remains, with Trump, of shared Russian-American sympathy for the weakening or breakup of the European Union. In many places, Trump\u2019s valueless foreign policy has provoked such uncertainty bordering on dismay. Trust has been eroded. The State Department, led by a cipher, has been consistently undermined. When I covered the war in Bosnia more than two decades ago, I got to know an honorable Foreign Service officer \u2014 I have known many over the years \u2014 named Ron Neitzke. He had been troubled by America\u2019s attempt to ignore genocide and done all he could to right that. Reflecting later on the experience, Neitzke wrote: \u201cOne must, in essence, be guided by the belief that a policy fundamentally at odds with our national conscience cannot endure indefinitely \u2014 if that conscience is well and truthfully informed.\u201d What Trump is attempting is no less than the destruction of America\u2019s \u201cnational conscience.\u201d This must be resisted by all means.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/opinion/trumps-valueless-foreign-policy.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T05:11:35-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-05-02T05:11:35-04:00", "abstract": "An unprecedented and dangerous assault on America\u2019s national conscience", "title": "Trump\u2019s Valueless Foreign Policy"}
