{"text": "Jim Kaat was young and Warren Spahn was old, and the kid wanted to learn from the master. He asked a coach to arrange a meeting, and for 20 minutes the ancient lefty told the green lefty about mechanics \u2014 how to use the torso to drive to the plate, and so on. The pitchers parted, and then Spahn turned back for a final word. \u201cOh, kid, one more thing I meant to tell you,\u201d he told Kaat. \u201cWhen the game\u2019s tied in the seventh inning, the game\u2019s just starting. You have to learn how to pitch Mickey Mantle differently in the ninth inning than you did in the first inning.\u201d Kaat, who ultimately earned 283 victories in the majors, laughed as he recalled the anecdote by telephone on Monday. \u201cThat would be so strange today,\u201d he said. Kaat, 78, has stayed in baseball as an analyst for MLB Network. But the games he broadcasts are very different from the ones he played. Noah Syndergaard, the muscular right-hander for the Mets, has made 63 starts \u2014 including games in October \u2014 in an electrifying young career. He has not completed any, but he has achieved one goal. For the second year in a row, Syndergaard throws a harder fastball than any other starter in baseball: 98.2 miles per hour. Only now, he cannot pitch at all, because he tore his right latissimus muscle on Sunday when he came out firing at 100 m.p.h. in Washington. Officially, he is on the 10-day disabled list. But the Mets acknowledged he will miss weeks, not days. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad to see,\u201d Kaat said. \u201cYou get a guy like Syndergaard and so many other young pitchers \u2014 they\u2019re so much more talented and gifted than we were.\u201d They know how to pitch, too. Half of Syndergaard\u2019s pitches this season have been sliders, curveballs and changeups. He has an impressive repertory and seems to enjoy the craft, not just brute force, of pitching, which makes his fixation on velocity such a shame. Syndergaard bought so thoroughly into his Thor persona last winter that he should have just carried a hammer to spring training. He was jacked, unapologetically so. Why did the hardest-throwing starter in the majors \u2014 98 miles per hour last season, according to FanGraphs \u2014 need to bulk up and throw even harder? \u201cI want to set goals, not necessarily throw harder, but just make the game easier,\u201d he said this spring. \u201cJust never become complacent and try to maintain anything, because once you start maintaining, you ultimately lose.\u201d That rationale sounds fine on the surface, but it contradicts decades of examples of pitchers who lost a little of their youthful fastballs yet continued to dominate. Syndergaard wanted more, a goal that was noble, perhaps, but ultimately reckless. Smart pitching minds saw an injury coming. Tom House, the former pitcher and coach who runs the National Pitching Academy in California, told  Bob Klapisch of The Bergen Record in February: \u201cUnfortunately, this is an injury waiting to happen by the second week of June. Unless you\u2019re picking up a ball while you\u2019re getting stronger, you\u2019re just adding muscle that doesn\u2019t know how to throw. It\u2019s unskilled muscle.\u201d Sure enough, Syndergaard had not thrown all winter, believing that consecutive seasons with around 200 innings were enough stress on his arm. And sure enough, an injury happened even before House expected. \u201cI hate being right about these kinds of things,\u201d House said by phone on Monday, adding that he had almost called the Mets\u2019 team doctor, David Altchek, last week. \u201cBut it\u2019s none of my business. I\u2019m not with Syndergaard every day; I\u2019m not part of the Mets\u2019 anything. I\u2019m friends with Danny Warthen\u201d \u2014 the Mets\u2019 pitching coach \u2014 \u201cand I just figured, well, it\u2019s going to run its course. In retrospect, I should have probably called the doctor and just kind of told him what my fears were.\u201d House, like Kaat, believes that developing pitchers should throw more, not less. The modern industry believes the opposite. Yet pitchers continue to break down. \u201cWhat happens in today\u2019s game is kids pitch too much, but they don\u2019t throw enough,\u201d House said. \u201cThat\u2019s the simplest way to explain it. They haven\u2019t created a broad enough throwing foundation to handle the pitching workloads. \u201cMy brother and I wore out three garage doors throwing tennis balls against them. We lived at the beach. I bet you I threw a million sea rocks at sea gulls. Not very environmentally friendly, but we were throwing all the time.\u201d Kaat worked under the renowned pitching coach Johnny Sain, who believed that pitchers should throw at least a little every day. Two of Sain\u2019s pitchers, Kaat and Tommy John, would go on to throw more than 4,500 innings apiece. No active pitcher has worked even 3,300 innings. \u201cThe single most important exercise that I did during my career was throwing the baseball,\u201d Kaat said. \u201cWhenever they would say, \u2018You sure you\u2019re not throwing too much?\u2019 I would say: \u2018Well, this is how I make my living. I\u2019m just spinning the ball. I\u2019m trying to figure out what makes it move, how can I make it do this and do that?\u2019 So my arm always stayed very flexible.\u201d Syndergaard is only a product of today\u2019s culture, in which the radar gun too often dictates a pitcher\u2019s value. But he also seems to have held too much sway over his employers, refusing their request for a magnetic resonance imaging for his biceps discomfort last week \u2014 and getting away with it. \u201cThe M.R.I. was not dismissed out of hand simply because Noah said he wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d General Manager Sandy Alderson told reporters in Atlanta on Monday. \u201cWe evaluate whether it\u2019s important to do so in spite of his opposition. That was factored into the decision as well. From that standpoint, who\u2019s not to say that things couldn\u2019t have been done differently?\u201d Alderson insisted there was no connection between the lat injury and the biceps problem. But did Syndergaard overcompensate on Sunday, trying to throw too hard to prove a point, and cause a new injury? \u201cAnything\u2019s possible,\u201d Alderson conceded. All we know, really, is that Syndergaard made the radar gun sizzle on Sunday. At a carnival, he would have won the biggest stuffed animal at the booth. At the ballpark, he won a lengthy trip to the disabled list.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/sports/baseball/new-york-mets-noah-syndergaards-injury.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T20:55:43-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T20:54:58-04:00", "abstract": "Noah Syndergaard, who throws the hardest fastball among starters, wanted more this season, a goal that was noble, perhaps, but ultimately reckless.", "title": "Seeing Noah Syndergaard\u2019s Injury Coming at 100 M.P.H."}
