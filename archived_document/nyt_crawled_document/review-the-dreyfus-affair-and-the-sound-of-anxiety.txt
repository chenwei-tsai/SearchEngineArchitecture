{"text": "The toxic mess of nationalism and anti-Semitism known as the Dreyfus Affair deeply divided France in the late 19th century, but any casual observer of the National Front\u2019s far-right ideology will know that the scandal\u2019s legacy continues to poison French society. A deep sense of anxiety is established from the very beginning of \u201cThe Dreyfus Affair,\u201d a hybrid of concert and theater that has proved to be the signature style of the Ensemble for the Romantic Century (\u201cJules Verne: From the Earth to the Moon,\u201d \u201cAnna Akhmatova: The Heart Is Not Made of Stone\u201d). Gyorgy Ligeti\u2019s creepy \u201cString Quartet No. 2\u201d opens the production. The music is performed live and paired with abstract projections, sometimes incorporating jumbled typography. (Handwriting played a key role in the Dreyfus debacle, as this French officer was framed for treason in 1894 based on an unsigned letter found at the German Embassy.) The effect is like watching Saul Bass credits for a psychological horror movie. As if to tighten a nightmarish vise on our minds, Ligeti\u2019s quartet returns at regular intervals during this the nearly three-hour show at the Fishman Space of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In other ways, though, the production, as written by Eve Wolf, the founder of the Ensemble, and directed by Donald T. Sanders, is straightforward. Unfairly accused of spying, Capt. Alfred Dreyfus (Max von Essen, last seen on Broadway in \u201cAn American in Paris\u201d) was dismissed from the military and shipped off to solitary confinement on Devil\u2019s Island, off French Guiana. Meanwhile, his wife, Lucie (Meghan Picerno), and brother, Mathieu (Mark Evans), tirelessly fought to clear his name. They battled not just the Army, which considered the Jewish captain a convenient scapegoat, but a virulently anti-Semitic press \u2014 David Bengali\u2019s projections include chilling period caricatures and slogans like \u201cFrance for the French\u201d (still heard at National Front rallies). The case split families and political parties, and stirred up the press. \u201cWhat a poignant drama, and what superb characters!\u201d the novelist \u00c9mile Zola (Peter Scolari, who played Hannah\u2019s father on \u201cGirls\u201d) ) enthused before going on to pen the pro-Dreyfus editorial \u201cJ\u2019accuse\u2026!,\u201d the opening salvo of the modern engaged intellectual. Zola\u2019s passion provides welcome fire to a show that otherwise hews to a calm, even-keeled tone, exemplified by Mr. von Essen\u2019s sober performance. Much of the emotion is supplied by the musical selections, which both illustrate and comment on the story, and are not necessarily from the actual Dreyfus era \u2014 a conceptual gambit that can be just as distracting as illuminating. Baroque pieces by Jean-Philippe Rameau predate the affair by centuries, and are used in a head-scratching ballet of military officers; Jehan Alain\u2019s pulsating \u201cLitanies,\u201d performed with verve by the organist Parker Ramsay, could have been lifted from the Emerson, Lake & Palmer songbook but are from the 1930s, three decades after Dreyfus was rehabilitated. The point may be to underline the timelessness of the issues raised by the officer\u2019s persecution. Bracingly, the show reminds us that in 2002, a statue of Dreyfus was defaced in Paris.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/theater/review-the-dreyfus-affair-and-the-sound-of-anxiety.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T13:09:43-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-30T13:09:43-04:00", "abstract": "This production is a hybrid of concert and theater, a combination that has become the signature of the Ensemble for the Romantic Century.", "title": "Review: \u2018The Dreyfus Affair\u2019 and the Sound of Anxiety"}
