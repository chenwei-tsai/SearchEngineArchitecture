{"text": "The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth prides itself on its collection of works by modern masters like Picasso, Matisse and Mondrian. And now it can add Amedeo Modigliani, the Italian artist who died young and today fetches upward of $170 million at auctions, to its roster. Gwendolyn Weiner, daughter of the locally famous art collectors Ted and Lucile Weiner, has donated Modigliani\u2019s sculpture \u201cHead\u201d (circa 1913) to the museum in honor of her parents. Modigliani (1884-1920) is said to have seen himself as more of a sculptor than a painter, though fewer than 30 sculptures by him survive today, compared with hundreds of paintings. The Kimbell\u2019s \u201cHead\u201d is carved in limestone, which Modigliani scavenged from construction sites around Paris, including the city\u2019s subway. The coveted \u201cHead\u201d sculptures bear Modigliani\u2019s signature look: elegant, often elongated figures that verge on abstraction and appear inspired by statues in far-flung locales like Africa and ancient Greece. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has one in its collection, from 1912, and in 2014 Modigliani\u2019s \u201cT\u00eate\u201d (1911-12) sold for $70.7 million at Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 a record for the artist until his painting \u201cNu Couch\u00e9\u201d (1917-18) fetched $170.4 million at Christie\u2019s the next year. The Weiners bought their sculpture from the Knoedler Gallery in New York in 1963. They displayed it for years alongside other 20th-century works in their Fort Worth home designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, the architect behind museums including the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Dallas Museum of Art. For the past two decades, the Modigliani has been on view at the Palm Springs Art Museum in California.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/design/kimbell-art-museum-modigliani-sculpture.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T14:47:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T14:47:03-04:00", "abstract": "Gwendolyn Weiner, daughter of the collectors Ted and Lucile Weiner, donated Modigliani\u2019s \u201cHead\u201d (circa 1913) to the museum in honor of her parents.", "title": "Kimbell Art Museum in Texas Acquires a Rare Modigliani Sculpture"}
