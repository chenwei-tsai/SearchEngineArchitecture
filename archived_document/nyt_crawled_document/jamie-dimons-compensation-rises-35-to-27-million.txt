{"text": "JPMorgan Chase paid Jamie Dimon, its chairman and chief executive, 35 percent more in 2015 than the previous year\u2019s compensation package, which was only narrowly approved by shareholders. According to a securities filing on Thursday, Mr. Dimon received $27 million \u2014 much of it in stock linked to the bank\u2019s performance, one week after the bank recorded a record profit of $24.4 billion for the year. Pay disclosures by Wall Street firms are closely watched, as many banks face pressure from shareholders to overhaul pay practices. That has caused many banks to shift more pay to stock that will be granted only if the company meets certain performance goals. JPMorgan is the first big bank to disclose 2015 compensation for its top executives. The annual disclosure about Mr. Dimon, who runs the biggest bank in the United States in terms of assets, often sets the bar for the industry. Still, overall compensation on Wall Street is down as firms grapple with volatile markets. At Goldman Sachs, where revenue slipped 2 percent last year, the amount of money set aside for employee pay was about the same as the previous year. At Morgan Stanley, compensation in the investment bank as well as the wealth management division declined. This is the first year JPMorgan is using performance share units as part of the variable pay for its top executives. The units are tied to whether the bank meets certain financial performance goals over the next couple of years. Mr. Dimon\u2019s salary was $1.5 million last year, the same as the previous year. His cash bonus dropped to $5 million from $7.5 million, but his stock award jumped to $20.5 million from $11.1 million. For 2014, Mr. Dimon got restricted stock units. He did not get a pay increase from 2013 to 2014, receiving $20 million both years. JPMorgan shareholders nearly voted down 2014 pay for the bank\u2019s top executives at last spring\u2019s annual meeting, prompting the move to performance-based awards. Only 61 percent of votes cast were in favor of the bank\u2019s executive compensation after it came under heavy criticism from the influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Company, which said the board\u2019s policies did not adequately link pay to performance. About 40 percent of Mr. Dimon\u2019s bonus was in cash for 2014. For 2015, that percentage dropped to 20 percent. Last year, JPMorgan\u2019s stock rose 5.7 percent, significantly outperforming its major rivals, almost all of which ended the year in the red.\u00a0 Banks with large Wall Street divisions, like JPMorgan, have faced a number of challenges lately, including new regulations and volatile markets. Analysts and investors have given Mr. Dimon credit for steering his firm past these rough spots. \u00a0 Other top JPMorgan executives received half their stock-based bonuses in the form of performance stock units, the bank said on Thursday. Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer, received $3.075 million in restricted stock and another $3.075 million in performance share units. Mary Callahan Erdoes, the chief executive of its asset management division, received $5.175 million in restricted stock and $5.175 million in performance share units. Daniel E. Pinto, the chief executive of corporate and investment banking, received $5,807,875 in restricted stock and the same in performance shares, and Matthew E. Zames, the chief operating officer, received $5.325 million each in restricted stock and performance shares.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/business/dealbook/jamie-dimons-compensation-rises-35-to-27-million.html", "published_date": "2016-01-20T19:00:00-05:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T07:00:08-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T07:00:08-04:00", "abstract": "The bank cut the chief executive\u2019s cash bonus and paid its top executives largely in stock awards tied to the company\u2019s performance.", "title": "Jamie Dimon\u2019s Compensation at JPMorgan Chase Rises 35%, to $27 Million"}
