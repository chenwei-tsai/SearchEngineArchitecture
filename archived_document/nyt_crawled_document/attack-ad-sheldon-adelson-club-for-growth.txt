The spot, by the 45Committee, which was heavily funded by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and the wealthy Ricketts family during the presidential campaign, centers on the Club for Growth\u2019s support for Bob Gray, one of the Republican candidates in the 18-person field in the special election in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. But hitting Mr. Gray is a proxy fight in which the 45Committee, one of the biggest outside groups behind Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential race, is taking a shot at a potential Trump critic. The spot, airing nationally on Fox News, describes the conservative Club for Growth \u2014 one of the best-funded groups on the right \u2014 as being responsible for \u201csaving\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law by criticizing the initial deal the White House considered. The spot goes on to accuse the club of \u201csaving\u201d Planned Parenthood as well, and notes that it \u201cattacked\u201d Mr. Trump. The spot coincides with a direct-mail campaign that the 45Committee sent to about 100,000 homes, criticizing Mr. Gray. The ad buy is roughly $300,000, an official for the 45Committee said. By airing it on Fox News, there is at least some chance that Mr. Trump, an avid cable news viewer, will see it. \u201cThe Club for Growth has actually spent more money this year against conservatives than the D.N.C., D.S.C.C. and D.C.C.C. combined,\u201d said Brian Baker, the 45Committee president, using the abbreviations for the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic senatorial and congressional campaign committees. \u201cAt the same time, the Club for Growth saved Obamacare from repeal and ensured continued taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood,\u201d he added. \u201cNow they\u2019re attacking some of the best and brightest young leaders in the conservative movement in an attempt to shift the blame. They\u2019ve gone too far.\u201d A spokesman for the club declined to comment, saying the group was focused on the Georgia special election. The vote on Tuesday will decide who should fill the seat vacated by Tom Price, a Republican who left the House to become Mr. Trump\u2019s health and human services secretary.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/politics/attack-ad-sheldon-adelson-club-for-growth.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T18:53:23-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Ad by Pro-Trump Group Attacks the Club for Growth", "created_date": "2017-04-18T18:53:23-04:00", "section": "U.S."}
