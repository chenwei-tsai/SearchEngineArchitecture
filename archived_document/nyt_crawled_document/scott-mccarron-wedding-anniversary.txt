A year ago, he and his then-girlfriend, Jenny Klein, took one look from the first tee at Top of the Rock, the nine-hole Jack Nicklaus-designed par-3 course that co-hosts the event, gazed at the Ozark Mountains on the horizon and were smitten. There in the distance was the resort\u2019s three-story wedding chapel with its bell-towered steeple and sweeping sunset views of Table Rock Lake. \u201cWe said, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be a beautiful place to get married someday?\u2019\u201d recalled McCarron, 51. That moment was the start of a whirlwind wedding \u2014 and a run of unprecedented success for a journeyman pro who had just begun to adjust his game after the unconventional putting style he long relied upon was outlawed. The couple married that Saturday in a spur-of-the-moment ceremony at the Chapel of the Ozarks after he completed his second round at the tournament, the Bass Pro Shops Legends of Golf. (On Sunday, his first anniversary, McCarron and his partner, Brad Faxon, finished this year\u2019s competition in a tie for 30th place with a combined 5-under-par 103 over 36 holes on the par-3 course.) Faxon was McCarron\u2019s best man. Peter Jacobsen hustled into town after his round and bought a suit so that he could walk the bride down the aisle. Other players served as groomsmen and their wives as bridesmaids. While McCarron was playing at Top of the Rock, the bride-to-be spent $150 on a wedding dress, shoes and veil and $50 on two wedding bands. The knot\u2019s one loose end was tied as the couple dressed in their bathroom, Jenny McCarron, n\u00e9e Klein, said. \u201cI said, \u2018Wait a second, you didn\u2019t ask me to marry you yet,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI made him get down on one knee right there and then on the bathroom tile, and he did.\u201d Kirk Elmquist, the Legends of Golf tournament director, officiated the ceremony. The power to pronounce the couple husband and wife, he said, was vested in him by the PGA Tour, the PGA Tour Champions and the tournament\u2019s sponsor. \u201cWe always said if we got married we\u2019d register at Bass Pro Shops,\u201d McCarron said. \u201cWe could\u2019ve planned a wedding for a year and it wouldn\u2019t have turned out as good.\u201d The marriage \u2014 the second for both; McCarron has two children from his prior relationship \u2014 has done wonders for his golf game. Jenny, 47, is a triathlete, and the couple regularly run, swim, bike and work out together. Friends say she has brought balance to his life. \u201cThey\u2019re really perfect for each other,\u201d Faxon said. \u201cJenny would be happy fishing for food and living in an igloo, and so would he.\u201d Since saying, \u201cI do,\u201d McCarron has been on a tear. In early June, he won his first tournament as a senior, the Principal Charity Classic in Des Moines, and hoisted three trophies in a span of 17 tournaments, including the Allianz Championship in February. He won just three times in 442 starts on the PGA Tour, but only Bernhard Langer has won as often as McCarron since June on the senior tour. McCarron\u2019s rise was anything but a steady climb. After playing in college at U.C.L.A., he quit the game for four years and sold embroidered shirts. He was always a long bomber off the tee, but he was held back by his putting. But then, in 1991, he attended the Senior Gold Rush in Rancho Murieta, Calif., and noticed several competitors anchoring a long putter against their chests. That night, he took a Ping Anser 2 putter and made his own. \u201cI cut off the top of the grip, then took a Cleveland Classic 3-wood, broke it over my knee and took the shaft and shoved it down as far as it went. It measured right about 48 inches,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a little light and rattled at the bottom.\u201d To add weight, he poured sand from a bunker down the shaft. A little more ingenuity took care of the rattle. \u201cI chewed Hubba Bubba bubble gum,\u201d he said. \u201cChewed it up and shoved it around the top of the shaft and glued it with Elmer\u2019s Glue.\u201d The next day, he took his homemade putter for a spin, and the game was suddenly easier. He won a local amateur event; qualified for the U.S. Mid-Amateur Championship, a competition for elite nonprofessionals age 25 and up; and realized playing golf beat slinging shirts for a living. He turned pro in 1992, and enjoyed a solid if unspectacular career on the PGA Tour, with earnings of $12,649,527. He last won in 2001, and spent his late 40s doing television commentary \u2014 a gig he still keeps up for the United States Open and a handful of events for Fox Sports. \u201cI think he eyed turning 50 and the Champions Tour as the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d said Faxon, his partner again at the team competition that began Saturday. Once eligible for the senior circuit in the summer of 2015, McCarron showed flashes that he still possessed enough game to return to the winner\u2019s circle, but he kept stalling. \u201cI was always trying to force things,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to hit the heroic shot.\u201d After stumbling in the final round of the Regions Tradition last May and finishing sixth, McCarron took Hale Irwin to dinner. He picked the brain of Irwin, a Hall of Famer, three-time U.S. Open champion and the winner of a record 45 titles on the senior circuit. Irwin gave him a piece of advice that has become McCarron\u2019s mantra. \u201cHe said, \u2018Find out what kind of player you are and be that player,\u2019\u201d McCarron said. Two weeks later, McCarron notched his first senior win, and in November, he captured the Dominion Charity Classic in Virginia, one of four Charles Schwab Cup playoff events. McCarron\u2019s run is all the more remarkable considering that the United States Golf Association banned the anchored putting stroke at the beginning of 2016. \u201cI could\u2019ve been out of golf, and yet I\u2019m putting better not anchored than I ever did before,\u201d said McCarron, who ranks fourth in putting average this season. He still uses the long putter, but keeps the handle away from his chest. McCarron\u2019s victory at the Allianz Championship in Boca Raton, Fla., was the best of both worlds. He displayed the patience and golf intellect preached by Irwin and struck the heroic shot when it mattered most. Trailing by one stroke on the par-5 18th hole at the Old Course at Broken Sound, McCarron planted a 7-iron six feet from the hole and made the eagle putt for a final-round 67 and a one-stroke victory over Kenny Perry and Carlos Franco. \u201cThe neatest part was doing it the way I did \u2014 kind of a drop-the-mike situation,\u201d he said. His first anniversary may be behind him, but the honeymoon continues for McCarron, even if it was a long time coming. \u201cI wish I was 25 again knowing what I know now and feeling this good about my game, with the team that I have in my corner,\u201d he said.", "abstract": "Scott McCarron had three wins in his entire PGA Tour career. Since a spur-of-the-moment, golf-centric wedding, he has three wins on the senior circuit."}
