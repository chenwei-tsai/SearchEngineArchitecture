{"section": "U.S.", "text": "Louisiana has dismissed all charges against a man who spent several years on death row after the his infant son died in 2012, in a case that drew national attention to a parish that sentenced young black men to death at an unusually high rate. Rodricus Crawford, 28, a resident of Caddo Parish, La., in the northwestern corner of the state, was sentenced to death in 2013 after prosecutors argued that he had suffocated his son. But Louisiana\u2019s supreme court threw out his conviction in November after finding that the jury selection in his case may have been racially biased. Mr. Crawford was released from prison later that month. In a statement announcing that it would not retry Mr. Crawford, the Caddo Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office acknowledged evidence suggesting that at the time of death, his son had pneumonia and bacteria in his blood that indicated sepsis. The state said that it could not meet the burden of proof to gain a new conviction for Mr. Crawford. Cecilia Kappel, one of Mr. Crawford\u2019s lawyers, described him in an interview on Thursday as someone who should never have been facing such a stark sentence to begin with. \u201cThey can\u2019t even justify prosecuting this guy for negligent homicide, let alone capital murder,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows the arbitrariness of the death penalty. \u201cNow he\u2019s having to start from zero at 28 years old,\u201d she added. From 2010 to 2014, among counties with four or more death sentences, more people were sentenced to to be executed per capita in Caddo Parish than in any other county in the United States. Many of those cases were prosecuted by Dale Cox, whose conduct attracted national interest after he told The Shreveport Times in a 2015 interview that Louisiana should \u201ckill more people.\u201d Mr. Cox, who returned to the district attorney\u2019s office full-time in 2011 and became the parish\u2019s acting district attorney in 2015, prosecuted four of the 16 people sent to death row from Caddo Parrish in those years. Mr. Cox, who could not be reached for comment, gained a reputation for inflammatory comments and behavior inside and outside the courtroom, and was even accused of threatening opposing lawyers. In Mr. Crawford\u2019s case, according to The New Yorker, he wrote a letter to state\u2019s probation department asking that the convicted man be forced to endure \u201cas much physical suffering as it is humanly possible to endure before he dies.\u201d Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, who has tracked Mr. Crawford\u2019s case closely, said that Mr. Cox\u2019s behavior could not be understood outside the context of Caddo Parish, pointing toward the county\u2019s long history of lynchings and to a monument to the Confederacy that sits right outside its courthouse, as well as its brief status as a Confederate capital. He said a Confederate flag continued to fly on the monument as recently as 2011. \u201cWhen one black juror expressed his displeasure at that, he was excused for cause,\u201d Mr. Dunham said, referring to a case that was not Mr. Crawford\u2019s. \u201cThey found that his objection to the Confederate flag was reason enough for him not to serve on a jury.\u201d Caddo Parish even captured the attention of the United States Supreme Court. In a 2016 dissent to a ruling on another Caddo Parish case, Justice Stephen G. Breyer noted that the parish \u201cimposes almost half the death sentences in Louisiana, even though it accounts for only 5 percent of that state\u2019s population and 5 percent of its homicides.\u201d \u201cGiven these facts,\u201d he continued, the defendant in the case in question, \u201cmay well have received the death penalty not because of the comparative egregiousness of his crime, but because of an arbitrary feature of his case, namely, geography.\u201d", "item_type": "Article", "abstract": "Rodricus Crawford\u2019s case drew national attention to a parish that sentenced young black men to death at an unusually high rate.", "created_date": "2017-04-20T15:13:17-04:00", "title": "Louisiana Man Who Spent Three Years on Death Row Has Murder Charge Dismissed", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-19T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/us/louisiana-death-row-inmate.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T15:16:56-04:00"}
