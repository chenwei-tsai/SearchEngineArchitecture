Nothing personal, of course. With that famously fluttery manner that can mask a flintiness underneath, she just seems an irresistibly ideal Winnie, the chattering central character of Samuel Beckett\u2019s bleakly sun-bleached existential comedy \u201cHappy Days.\u201d Opening on Thursday, May 4, at Theater for a New Audience\u2019s Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn, James Bundy\u2019s Yale Repertory Theater production stars Ms. Wiest as the beleaguered but unbowed Winnie, opposite Jarlath Conroy as her moldering husband, Willie. An Oscar winner for a pair of Woody Allen films, \u201cHannah and Her Sisters\u201d and \u201cBullets Over Broadway,\u201d Ms. Wiest earned admiring reviews when she undertook the formidable Beckett role last spring in New Haven. \u201cAnother heavenly day,\u201d the immobilized Winnie says as the play begins. For audiences, this may be true indeed.
