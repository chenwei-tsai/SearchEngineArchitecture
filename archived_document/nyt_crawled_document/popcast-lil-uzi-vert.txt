{"text": "The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news. Lil Uzi Vert has purple dreadlocks, a diamond-encrusted chain with a likeness of Marilyn Manson, an aversion to interviews, and a single, \u201cXO TOUR Llif3,\u201d which recently went to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. He is an unlikely subrosa hip-hop star \u2014 as much singer as rapper, as much rock as rap. With a robust SoundCloud presence and buoyed by social-media induced fanaticism, he is succeeding at his own frenetic and off-kilter tempo. On this week\u2019s Popcast, Mr. Caramanica discusses the unlikely rise of Lil Uzi Vert with Joe Coscarelli, pop music reporter for The New York Times, and David Turner, a freelance writer for Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and others who recently wrote a primer on Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s early work for Stereogum. The first point of discussion: What is it that Lil Uzi Vert does? Mr. Coscarelli describes him as originating in a small group of young hip-hop artists who \u201care really more characters and celebrities on social media than they are rappers.\u201d They\u2019re fashion-conscious, have very defined aesthetics and have learned how to craft a narrative around themselves. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is world-building \u2014 the music comes second.\u201d Mr. Turner explains why experiencing Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s catalog en masse, on SoundCloud, is the most effective method: \u201cYou maybe don\u2019t notice the details because there\u2019s so much, so the idea of Uzi is larger than the individual songs.\u201d After listening to a clip of \u201cBuy It,\u201d Mr. Coscarelli notes of Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s songwriting technique, \u201cIt\u2019s by sheer force of will and charisma and repetition that some of these things start to stick out.\u201d And Mr. Caramanica argues that the worst thing a label could do would be to teach Uzi the proper way to write songs: \u201cHe takes essentially trash parts, like waste-bin stuff, and stitches it together into something that roughly approximates rap, or not, and it works.\u201d (Later, the group listens to a snippet of a version of Migos\u2019s \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d edited to only include Uzi\u2019s \u201cya\u201d vocal over and over again.) There\u2019s a brattiness and nonsensical nature to Uzi\u2019s songs that appeal to younger audiences. And while Mr. Turner says that for kids, Uzi is a rock star (since few rock musicians have emerged to fill that role in the 2010s), that positioning is wise from a business perspective too, as festival bills are packed with bands and light on rappers. Watching \u201cXO TOUR Llif3\u201d performed in a festival setting, Mr. Coscarelli notes that the track becomes a singalong, \u201cand when you\u2019re only hearing the kids singing along, you might not even hear it as a rap song.\u201d Email your questions, thoughts and ideas about what\u2019s happening in pop music to popcast@nytimes.com.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/music/popcast-lil-uzi-vert.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T12:04:59-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T12:04:59-04:00", "abstract": "He\u2019s a rapper, a social media phenomenon, the guy yelling \u201cya\u201d on Migos\u2019s hit \u201cBad and Boujee.\u201d What\u2019s the secret of Uzi\u2019s success?
