{"text": "\u201cDuring the past four weeks, have you been tired? Been exhausted? Had difficulty getting motivated to do anything at all?\u201d These questions \u2014 which a substantial chunk of the population probably could answer in the affirmative \u2014 appeared on a questionnaire used in a major European study published recently in The New England Journal of Medicine. The authors were researching the effectiveness of a drug that is widely, if controversially, used to treat older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, better known as a slightly underactive thyroid. So many Americans take that medication \u2014 levothyroxine (brand name Synthroid) \u2014 that it topped the list of prescription drugs dispensed in the United States in 2015, according to the research firm QuintilesIMS Institute. With 121 million prescriptions annually, levothyroxine outpaced statins, blood pressure meds \u2014 and everything else. A Johns Hopkins survey published last year found that more than 15 percent of older Americans were taking it. So you\u2019d think these study results would come as shocking news: The European team reported that in older people with mild hypothyroidism, the drug had no significant effect on symptoms. At all. Instead, the results bolstered what a number of geriatricians and endocrinologists have suspected for years. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong signal that this is an overused medication,\u201d said Dr. Juan Brito, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cSome people really need this medicine, but not the vast majority of people who are taking it.\u201d A primer: Your pituitary gland manufactures a hormone called thyrotropin, or T.S.H. (thyroid stimulating hormone). T.S.H., in turn, directs the thyroid to produce hormones essential to many organs and systems: the heart, the brain, the muscles. High blood levels of T.S.H. indicate that the thyroid gland is less active than it should be. Usually, doctors order a blood test to measure the hormone when patients complain of symptoms suggestive of a failing thyroid \u2014 fatigue, constipation, weight gain, muscle weakness or cold sensitivity. Often, though, doctors simply order T.S.H. readings as part of routine blood work. \u201cAs people get older and see doctors more often, they\u2019re more likely to get these tests,\u201d said Dr. Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness. True or \u201covert\u201d hypothyroidism can cause intense symptoms and, if untreated, can lead to heart disease and other threats. People with T.S.H. readings over 10 milli-international units per liter of blood, and who have low levels of other thyroid hormones, generally get a prescription for levothyroxine \u2014 and need one. The questions arise when T.S.H. is only slightly higher than normal. Is that a disease? A slightly elevated T.S.H. may represent a normal consequence of aging. Or a temporary problem. It only rarely leads to serious hypothyroidism. Yet millions of older Americans, diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism based on T.S.H. numbers, are taking a medication that now appears pointless. \u201cWe were very aware the practices we adopt weren\u2019t really based on good evidence,\u201d said Dr. David Stott, a geriatrician at the University of Glasgow who led the new study, conducted with 737 adults over age 65 in Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland. He and his colleagues found subjects (average age: 74) through laboratory databases indicating that physicians had tested their T.S.H. at least twice. All had higher-than-normal T.S.H. levels and, on questionnaires assessing tiredness and other hypothyroid symptoms, nearly all expressed some of the standard complaints. Dr. Stott and his colleagues also administered a series of other tests assessing handgrip strength, speed of cognitive function, health-related quality of life, weight and blood pressure. Then, half the group began taking levothyroxine while the others took a placebo; all were followed for at least a year. \u201cOne would expect to see a change within a year, if you were going to see a change,\u201d Dr. Stott said. The drug, let\u2019s note, did what it\u2019s designed to do: It lowered T.S.H. to levels considered normal (in this study, .4 to 4.59 mIU per liter). Among placebo takers, T.S.H. barely budged. But, so what? On questionnaires inquiring about tiredness and other hypothyroid symptoms, on all the other pre- and post-tests, taking the drug brought no improvement. It didn\u2019t make patients physically stronger or mentally faster. They didn\u2019t lose weight or feel more energetic. \u201cWe are tending to medicalize and rush to think we need to treat it,\u201d Dr. Stott said. But older people with a T.S.H. under 10 mIU won\u2019t benefit from levothyroxine, he has concluded. Treatment of other so-called precursor conditions, like pre-diabetes and osteopenia, has generated the same sort of criticism, it\u2019s worth noting. Why are so many taking levothyroxine, then? The prevalence of overt hypothyroidism hasn\u2019t changed much, but the number of annual prescriptions keeps climbing. Dr. David Aron, an endocrinologist at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, offered one explanation: Hypothyroid symptoms can be vague and nonspecific. Tiredness, weight gain, aching muscles or joints, memory problems \u2014 how many people over age 65 don\u2019t experience some of those? \u201cAre they actually due to thyroid disease or to something else?\u201d Dr. Aron wondered. (He suggested a couple of alternative diagnoses: \u201cPostmodern humanity. The current state of politics.\u201d) Thyroid function also seems simple to test for and to treat. As an explanation for common symptoms, \u201cprimary care doctors like it,\u201d said Dr. Brito. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to talk about your life or your sleep, to find out why you\u2019re tired.\u201d Those doctors might also be prescribing levothyroxine based on a single T.S.H. test. That\u2019s a mistake, Dr. Aron said. T.S.H. levels vary day to day, even hour to hour, and often stabilize on their own. In fact, the new study excluded 60 percent of potential subjects because their T.S.H. levels had returned to normal when retested, without any treatment at all. Reassuringly, levothyroxine doesn\u2019t appear to cause a lot of side effects, unless doses get too high. Compared to many drugs, the generic form isn\u2019t expensive. But adding one more drug becomes burdensome in itself, given the complicated, expensive medication routines many older people follow. Patients in the European study, for instance, already averaged four prescriptions. Taking levothyroxine requires considerable juggling, too. Most patients need three or four blood tests over several months to get the dosage right. The drug should be taken on an empty stomach. It interacts with a number of other common medications, including certain antacids. Supplements containing iron or calcium also affect its absorption. Yet once patients begin thyroid replacement, they rarely end it, even if they feel as draggy or achy as ever. \u201cHere\u2019s a golden opportunity for many patients to simplify their medication regimens,\u201d Dr. Alexander said. Before starting it, consider Dr. Aron\u2019s approach. When older people come in with mild symptoms that might be thyroid-related \u2014 or might not \u2014 he tests for T.S.H. more than once. If it remains slightly elevated, \u201cwe can follow this and see how it goes,\u201d he tells patients. \u201cAlternatively, we could try a course of medication for a couple of months.\u201d \u201cIf it helps you feel better, great. If it doesn\u2019t, we stop.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/health/could-be-the-thyroid-could-be-ennui-either-way-the-drug-isnt-helping.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T11:33:14-04:00", "abstract": "Doctors often prescribe levothyroxine to treat an underactive thyroid, and for most it has no effect.", "title": "Could Be the Thyroid; Could Be Ennui.
