{"text": "Political figures loom large in our featured titles this week: Hillary Clinton, whose presidential campaign receives a painful autopsy in \u201cShattered\u201d; Paul Ryan, whose Wisconsin hometown is the subject of \u201cJanesville\u201d; and George W. Bush, whose best-selling book of paintings of veterans, \u201cPortraits of Courage,\u201d occasions debate about the value of bearing witness to a war of your own making. Dominic Dromgoole\u2019s \u201cHamlet Globe to Globe\u201d takes readers around the world with a production of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy, and a debut novel, \u201cMy Cat Yugoslavia,\u201d enchants with its depiction of the disorientation of exile. \u2014Radhika JonesEditorial Director, Books SHATTERED: Inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s Doomed Campaign, by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. (Crown, $28.) This blow-by-blow account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 run for the White House includes observations by campaign and Democratic Party insiders. \u201cThe portrait of the Clinton campaign that emerges from these pages,\u201d our critic Michiko Kakutani wrote, \u201cis that of a Titanic-like disaster: an epic fail made up of a series of perverse and often avoidable missteps by an out-of-touch candidate and her strife-ridden staff.\u201d THE NEW BOOK OF SNOBS: A Definitive Guide to Modern Snobbery, by D.J. Taylor. (Constable, About $21.) Taylor\u2019s clever and timely taxonomy of snobbery argues that the world would be a poorer place without a bit of insolence and ostentation. Our critic Dwight Garner wrote that Taylor is \u201castute, supremely well read and frequently very funny. In its combination of impact with effervescence, his book puts me in mind of a Black Velvet, that curious cocktail made from Guinness stout and champagne.\u201d JANESVILLE: An American Story, by Amy Goldstein. (Simon & Schuster, $27.) Goldstein, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Washington Post, writes in \u201cJanesville\u201d about the impact on the small Wisconsin factory city of the title when General Motors closes a plan there. Janesville also happens to be the hometown of Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker. Our critic Jennifer Senior called the book \u201ceye-opening, important, a diligent work of reportage.\u201d HAMLET GLOBE TO GLOBE: Two Years, 190,000 Miles, 197 Countries, One Play, by Dominic Dromgoole. (Grove, $27.) To celebrate the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s birth, London\u2019s Globe Theater performed \u201cHamlet\u201d all around the world. Dromgoole\u2019s witty account of the ambitious two-year tour \u2014 \u201ca compulsively readable, intensely personal chronicle of performances in places as various as Djibouti and Gdansk, Taipei and Bogot\u00e1,\u201d in the words of our reviewer, Stephen Greenblatt \u2014 offers insight about the play and its enduring appeal. ONE OF THE BOYS, by Daniel Magariel. (Scribner, $22.) After a brutal custody battle, two brothers watch their father drift into addiction in a gripping and heartfelt first novel that brims with wisdom about the self-destructive longing for paternal approval. For all the betrayal and resentment that binds them, Magariel\u2019s characters feel neither typecast nor pitied. A RABBLE OF DEAD MONEY: The Great Crash and the Global Depression, 1929-1939, by Charles R. Morris. (PublicAffairs, $29.99.) This overview of the policy response to the Great Depression is a deft synthesis, blending colorful accounts of the past with the scholarly literature of the present and stretching beyond U.S. borders. Instead of focusing on Wall Street, Morris turns his attention to the other side of the Atlantic, arguing that \u201cAll of the tangled threads that twisted together to create the catastrophe of the Depression originated in Europe.\u201d THE KNOWLEDGE ILLUSION: Why We Never Think Alone, by Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach. (Riverhead, $28.) Two cognitive scientists argue that not only rationality but the very idea of individual thinking is a myth, and that humans think in groups. That\u2019s not necessarily bad news, writes Yuval Harari in our review: \u201cOur reliance on groupthink has made us masters of the world.\u2026 From an evolutionary perspective, trusting in the knowledge of others has worked extremely well for humans.\u201d MY CAT YUGOSLAVIA, by Pajtim Statovci. Translated by David Hackston. (Pantheon, $25.95.) Statovci\u2019s strange, haunting and utterly original exploration of displacement and desire interweaves the stories of a Kosovan woman and her son roiled by the aftershocks of exile. A singing, dancing cat encountered in a gay bar plays a role. In our review, T\u00e9a Obreht writes that the book is \u201ca marvel, a remarkable achievement and a world apart from anything you are likely to read this year.\u201d PORTRAITS OF COURAGE: A Commander in Chief\u2019s Tribute to America\u2019s Warriors, by George W. Bush. (Crown, $35.) The former president began painting three years after leaving the White House, inspired by Winston Churchill. Now Bush\u2019s portraits of 98 veterans, accompanied by their harrowing stories of injury and recovery, reveal a surprisingly adept artist doing penance for a great disaster of American history. SIGNS FOR LOST CHILDREN, by Sarah Moss. (Europa, paper, $19.) This fine exploration of a marriage between a doctor in Victorian England and her architect husband feels contemporary in its attention to the competing pulls of work and love, highlighted by distance. Tom\u2019s employer sends him to Japan; Ally works in insane asylum in Cornwall; and the novel juxtaposes their individual quests and the effect on their nascent relationship.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/books/review/10-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T15:28:51-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "List", "created_date": "2017-04-27T15:28:51-04:00", "abstract": "Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.", "title": "10 New Books We Recommend This Week"}
