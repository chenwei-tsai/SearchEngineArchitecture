Sure enough, he was right. One of the actors, Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho, said he was contacted before filming by a Turkish ambassador. Keeping in line with Turkey\u2019s official stance, the diplomat insisted that the genocide, in which nearly 1.5 million Armenians were killed, had never occurred. After the movie\u2019s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, it racked up 55,000 lowly one-star votes on the Internet Movie Database, which is quite something considering only a few thousand people had actually seen it at the three public screenings. And then, six weeks before \u201cThe Promise\u201d hit theaters this weekend came another film that shared uncanny parallels. Like \u201cThe Promise,\u201d \u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant\u201d hinges on a love triangle set in Turkey during the early days of World War I. Unlike \u201cThe Promise,\u201d \u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant,\u201d which stars Michiel Huisman and Josh Hartnett, was backed by Turkish investors and has been pilloried by critics for whitewashing historical events. The battle over these two new films represents just the latest front in Turkey\u2019s quest to control the historical narrative. In 1915, Ottoman Turks, fearful that the restive Christian Armenian population would side against them in the war, began massacring Armenians and force-marching them to their deaths. The United Nations, the Catholic Church, the European Parliament, historians and scholars have roundly recognized the atrocities as a genocide, the 20th century\u2019s first. But Turkey has insisted that many people, both Turkish and Armenian, carried out \u2014 and bore the brunt of \u2014 wartime horrors, and that no concerted extermination effort existed. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, acknowledged in 2014 that Armenians had \u201clost their lives\u201d and sent condolences to their descendants. But he implied that they were victims of a war in which all Ottoman citizens had suffered \u2014 rather than the victims of a genocide. \u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant\u201d which tells of a dashing Turkish officer who helps save imperiled Armenians \u2014 while carrying on with an American nurse \u2014 reinforces that debunked Turkish narrative, detractors say. The American Hellenic Council, calling for a boycott, said the film was plainly aimed at undercutting \u201cThe Promise,\u201d and falsely painted the genocide as two-sided. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of mirror image of our film, but with a totally denialist perspective,\u201d said Mr. George, adding that he suspects the Erdogan government had a hand in the rival film. Yet as it turns out, there was bitter division among key players on \u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant,\u201d both during production and after. According to several people familiar with the project, Turkish producers oversaw the final cut, without the director\u2019s knowledge. The people familiar with the project said that tensions emerged on the \u201cOttoman\u201d set after producers pushed to minimize depictions of Turkish violence against Armenians. Several people who worked on the project felt the final version butchered the film artistically, and smacked of denialism: Dialogue that explicitly referred to systematic mass killing had been stripped out. The director, Joseph Ruben, who refused to comment for this article, ended up doing no publicity for the film. \u201cAs we were making the film, he always knew they could control the editing room, so this was a tightrope that he had to walk,\u201d said Michael Steele, a first assistant director and producer on the film, referring to the Turkish producers. \u201cJoe was so enraged by their version of events he attempted to take his name off the film, but he realized contractually he was obliged to remain silent.\u201d The producers, distributor and lead actors in \u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant,\u201d which according to BoxOfficeMojo.com has taken in just $241,000 since its release in March, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The struggles over the two films are the latest in a series of attempts by Turkish interests to absolve their country of responsibility for the genocide, efforts that go back decades and have extended to Hollywood. In the 1930s, MGM scuttled a plan to make a movie about the killings after Turkey exerted intense pressure on the State Department and the studio itself. When the Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan, who is of Armenian descent, was making \u201cArarat,\u201d his 2002 film about the genocide, he was deluged with threats and told that Armenians in Turkey might be harmed as a result. An ultranationalist group later threatened Turkish theaters planning to show the film, resulting in canceled screenings. \u201cThe Promise,\u201d which stars Oscar Isaac as an Armenian medical student and Christian Bale as an American journalist, was unfettered by studio pressures. The film\u2019s financier was Kirk Kerkorian, the colorful Hollywood mogul and casino magnate, and the son of poor Armenian immigrants, who before his death in 2015 at 98, pledged $100 million toward the film, making it the biggest budget picture about the genocide yet. \u201cHe felt if we don\u2019t shine a light, we\u2019re doomed,\u201d said Eric Esrailian, a lead producer with Survival Pictures, Mr. Kerkorian\u2019s production company. Still, precautions were taken. Mr. George, whose credits include \u201cHotel Rwanda\u201d (2004), said he ensured that \u201cThe Promise\u201d was made under the radar, with no publicity. Production took place in Portugal, Malta and Spain, and there was tight security on the set. Joe Berlinger, who embedded with the \u201cPromise\u201d production to shoot a documentary about the genocide, said everyone on the set was concerned about safety. \u201cA lot of that is overblown \u2014 I think we\u2019ve gone from historical assassinations to digital assassinations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we all had this nebulous fear.\u201d Mr. Berlinger said he repeatedly reached out to Turkish officials for his documentary, \u201cIntent to Destroy,\u201d and was eventually invited to Ankara for meetings on the condition that he not bring recording devices or his crew. The Turks also refused to say who he\u2019d be speaking with. He demurred. (The film is to play the Tribeca Film Festival next week.) \u201cI felt like it would be a useless trip and one that was potentially dangerous, frankly,\u201d Mr. Berlinger said. It was in \u201cIntent to Destroy\u201d that the actor Mr. Gim\u00e9nez Cacho revealed that a Turkish ambassador had bombarded him with denialist propaganda, which Mr. Berlinger believes is part of a Turkish campaign to discourage people from tackling projects related to the genocide. Whether \u201cThe Promise\u201d does well or not at the box office this weekend, it continues to garner attention. In the week leading up to its release, it racked up thousands more votes on IMDB.com. It\u2019s at 126,000 votes and counting, largely split between 1-star and 10-star ratings. And last week, Kim Kardashian West, arguably the world\u2019s most famous Armenian American, tweeted her support of the film, having visited Armenia in 2015 to highlight the genocide. There are no plans yet to release \u201cThe Promise\u201d in Turkey (\u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant\u201d will open there May 19). Either way, Taner Akcam, a leading historian on the genocide and a professor at Clark University, said that officials there might characterize it as Armenian propaganda made with Armenian money, if they say anything at all. \u201cSilence, this is their usual strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Promise\u201d opens this weekend by design. April 24 marks the 102nd anniversary of the first stage of the genocide, when hundreds of Armenian intellectuals were arrested in Istanbul, a date Armenians worldwide commemorate each year. \u201cThe genocide is burned into the soul of the Armenian diaspora,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cAnd until they get some kind of recognition, it\u2019s not going to go away.\u201d", "abstract": "Two new films, \u201cThe Promise\u201d and \u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant,\u201d represent the latest battle in Turkey\u2019s quest to control the historical narrative on the Armenian genocide.", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T22:20:39-04:00", "title": "In Two Films That Mirror Each Other, a Distortion", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/movies/the-promise-the-ottoman-lieutenant-turkey-armenian-genocide.html"}
