{"text": "In the aisles of the American supermarket, hierarchies arise and collapse with the velocity of soap-opera drama. The produce section is especially cutthroat; here, because novel products are so rare, it\u2019s the stories that must change to entice consumers. Back in the 1970s, the Chinese gooseberry went global \u2014 cultivated in New Zealand and shipped to the world \u2014 after being rechristened as the friendlier kiwi. Just a few years ago, kale was king, rehabbed as a luxury green after decades as a garnish and a Southern standby. Similarly, quinoa, long a staple crop in the Andes, has lately become a Western fixture, an ostensibly more primal alternative to rice. The latest entrant to this contest is Brazilian a\u00e7a\u00ed, a purplish, antioxidant-rich stone fruit \u2014 though most call it a berry \u2014 foraged from trees in the Amazon River basin. On an April Monday in Sherman Oaks, Calif., the Harvest Bar was packed with adults in athleisure, eating pur\u00e9ed a\u00e7a\u00ed from bowls the size of flowerpots. The restaurant is a fast-casual \u201csuperfood cafe,\u201d one in a growing class of health-food restaurants doing brisk trade in the a\u00e7a\u00ed-bowl business, selling heaps of the pur\u00e9ed berries topped with diced fruit and other sweets. \u201cThe blend is like an ice cream,\u201d the owner, Aric Haut, explained. \u201cBut healthy.\u201d More than 5,000 miles to the south, harvesters in the Amazon basin of Brazil climb palm trees to pick the wild-growing fruit. What lies between these two distant parties is the latest unspooling of the food-fad plot \u2014 a supply chain driven by remarkable health claims, with money exchanged at every step along the way. In the Amazon River basin, a\u00e7a\u00ed \u2014 pronounced \u201cah-sah-EE\u201d \u2014 has been eaten since at least the dawn of written history. The fruit, until the 1970s, was constrained to just this region, where local ribeirinhos, or \u201criver people,\u201d plucked it from trees and ate it as part of nearly every meal. As a weak jungle economy pushed ribeirinhos into cities, their gradual migration formed a distribution network. At first, they sold a\u00e7a\u00ed from makeshift roadside carts. By the \u201980s, they were shipping it to Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo, where it gained a reputation as prime fuel for jiu-jitsu. High in omega fats and low in carbohydrates and sugar, its sweet and earthy flesh is filling yet light. By the \u201990s, Brazil had an a\u00e7a\u00ed-bar scene. As the berry gained status, its price began to rise. If the superfood plot were a bit more predetermined, you might expect a\u00e7a\u00ed to go the way of quinoa. When the protein-rich grain spread to supermarket aisles and started to appear in fast-casual restaurants, it moved out of reach for the Bolivian farmers whose dependence on the grain made it famous in the first place. The story with a\u00e7a\u00ed is not so simple. Here, surprising parties become heroes and scoundrels as the coveted berry changes hands in different ways. Global consumption has further increased demand, but because of the high value of good vibes, some superfood exporters have an incentive to hew to best practices. Sambazon, the leading exporter of the berry, has emerged as an unlikely steward of the crop. The company\u2019s chairman, Ryan Black, first tasted the fruit in the late \u201990s, back when it was mostly unknown in America. Black, a jock with a stoner\u2019s lilt, was a former football captain at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has since cornered the a\u00e7a\u00ed export market, in part by paying a guaranteed minimum price to harvesters, protecting wages from dipping too low. According to a sustainability study, workers along Sambazon\u2019s vertical supply chain can earn up to three times what the average Brazilian takes home. Beyond taking pains to demonstrate that its harvest is sustainable, the company has begun funding local schools for agro-forestry education and even devoting some of its fair-trade funds to health and child-care services in the region. The domestic Brazilian a\u00e7a\u00ed market, by contrast, is structured as a game of pass the baton. The berry\u2019s rise to fame in tandem with internal migration yielded a fluid and decentralized network: The guy who picks the fruit sells to the guy with the boat, who sells to the guy with the bigger boat, who sells to the guy with a stall in the market, who sells to the guy with the processing shop, who turns the fruit into frozen pur\u00e9e and ships it to distributors in Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo. According to studies of the a\u00e7a\u00ed economy, these stages of the chain are often disconnected, their workers unaware and uninvested in the steps that come before. This poses a risk to long-term sustainability. Should some ambitious operator upstream decide it\u2019s easier and cheaper to simply cut a\u00e7a\u00ed trees down, the ecosystem could collapse. But for now, this nascent economy offers low barriers to entry in a region much in need of opportunity. Because of this, the a\u00e7a\u00ed boom hasn\u2019t created an easy narrative of exploitation. For urban consumers in cities like Bel\u00e9m, according to Black, the cost of a\u00e7a\u00ed has risen sharply. To others, like the ribeirinhos, the trend has meant a sudden influx of cash, bringing capital (and flat screens) to isolated towns. For those who learn sustainable techniques, the boom could mean a long-term source of income for the region; for others driven to make a quick buck, the boom might remain just that \u2014 a boom. As a\u00e7a\u00ed mania has progressed, even multinationals have latched on to the trend, with both Coca-Cola and Pepsi now peddling a\u00e7a\u00ed-tinged drinks. The berry, for now, remains harvested in the wild, but some who study sustainability in the region worry that increased demand for the crop might ultimately strain wild harvesting operations and result in large-scale a\u00e7a\u00ed plantations. The same vibes that drive growth in the region might also destroy the same wholesome ethic that made a\u00e7a\u00ed appealing to Americans in the first place. For us, it might not matter; we\u2019ll probably have found a new superfood by then.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/magazine/the-superfood-gold-rush.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Magazine", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T05:00:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T05:00:07-04:00", "abstract": "Like quinoa before it, a\u00e7a\u00ed has become a craze among health-conscious Americans \u2014 creating a bonanza in the regions where it\u2019s grown.", "title": "The Superfood Gold Rush"}
