Disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday showed the contributions from corporate executives, lobbyists and businesses, as well as small donors, totaling $107 million. The previous record was held by President Barack Obama, who raised  $53 million for his 2009 inauguration. Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee is not required to report how it spent money on his inauguration festivities, which drew modest crowds in January. Nor do the documents reveal whether any funds were left over after the crowds returned home. The report is likely to only intensify questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to the populist ideas raised in recent weeks by several policy shifts and realignments among White House staff.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/politics/trump-inauguration-fundraising.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T18:04:00-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Trump Raised $107 Million for Inauguration, Doubling Record", "created_date": "2017-04-18T18:04:00-04:00", "section": "U.S."}
