As the jeep drove through villages, Mr. Dar said, \u201cI saw people breaking into tears on seeing my state.\u201d The incident, which came to light when a video spread on social media, provides a gauge of an insurgency that has waxed and waned over nearly three decades in Kashmir, an area also claimed by Pakistan, which supports the rebels. Unrest surged last July after Burhan Muzaffar Wani, a charismatic, 22-year-old separatist militant, was killed by Indian security forces. The police responded by firing on protesters with pellet guns, killing scores and injuring thousands, many of whom were blinded by pellets lodged in their eyes. The abuse of Mr. Dar occurred the day Kashmiris voted to fill a seat in the local Srinagar assembly. Following a call by separatists to boycott the election, only 7 percent of local Kashmiri voters turned out to vote, a low not seen in 27 years. Eight people were killed amid reports of widespread violence. A new vote was held on April 13, but only 2 percent of voters showed up. Mr. Dar, who says he never supported the separatists, complained: \u201cI voted, and this is what I got in return. Do you think it will help India in Kashmir? No. It will give Kashmiris another reason to hate India.\u201d India\u2019s army chief, Gen. Bipin Rawat, has vowed action against those responsible for tying Mr. Dar to the jeep. But he has also thundered against Kashmir\u2019s stone-throwing youth and separatist militants, saying in February: \u201cThey may survive today, but we will get them tomorrow. Our relentless operations will continue.\u201d Such posturing will only doom Kashmir to a deadly spiral, where more brutal military tactics will feed more despair and more militancy. In January, a team of concerned citizens presented a report to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government. Citing strong feelings of discrimination and a \u201ccomplete lack of faith\u201d by Kashmiris in government promises, it pleaded for improved human rights and a multiparty dialogue aimed at a durable political solution. Mr. Modi\u2019s government would do well to follow the recommendations of the report, before Indian democracy loses its credibility and Kashmiris are robbed of a chance to dream, along with the rest of India, of a peaceful, prosperous future.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T08:21:16-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/opinion/cruelty-and-cowardice-in-kashmir.html", "item_type": "Article"}
