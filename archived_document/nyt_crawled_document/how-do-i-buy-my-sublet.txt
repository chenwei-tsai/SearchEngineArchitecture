{"abstract": "The tenant is preapproved for a mortgage and doesn\u2019t mind that the place needs work \u2014 but that might not be enough to persuade an absentee landlord.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Q. I am subletting a one-bedroom in a Sutton Place co-op, which I love and would like to buy. The owner lives out of state and rarely uses it. Since he can sublet only two out of every five years, he won\u2019t be able to rent it for three years after my lease expires, and the apartment needs a lot of work. I am preapproved for a mortgage large enough to buy this apartment. How can I persuade him to sell to me? Would he save on a broker\u2019s fee? What about the board approval process? What else might persuade him? A. You are in a good position to make an offer \u2014 assuming, of course, your landlord wants to sell. Remember, plenty of people own apartments in New York that they do not live in or even visit very often. If the owner hasn\u2019t thought about selling, he might not know what the apartment is worth in today\u2019s market. Unable to see its flaws or know how it compares to other recent sales, he \u201cmight have an unrealistic expectation in pricing,\u201d said Joshua D. Arcus, the president of Siderow Residential Group, a real estate brokerage. Be prepared to educate him on the market, but gently. The seller would certainly save money if he avoids paying a broker fee, typically around 6 percent of the purchase price. However, you still might want to speak with a broker, who could advise you about pricing and strategies for approaching a seller. What else can you offer that another buyer cannot? An inside deal means he won\u2019t have to list the apartment for sale, stage it or make any repairs. All these things take time, effort and money. If you have been a good tenant, your board application process would probably be relatively smooth, assuming your financial package meets expectations. Letters of recommendation from current residents would help. \u201cIf there have been no complaints\u201d from other residents or building staff, said Steven R. Wagner, a Manhattan real estate lawyer and former co-op board president, \u201cthe board or admissions committee will feel more comfortable that the prospective purchaser will be a good neighbor.\u201d All of these assets make you a desirable candidate. But if your landlord is not in the mood to sell, none of them will really matter.", "section": "Real Estate", "title": "How Do I Buy My Sublet?", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/realestate/how-do-i-buy-my-sublet.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T13:56:47-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T13:56:44-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Question", "item_type": "Article"}
