{"text": "Dear Diary: Lights up on a cold March morning in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Two people, a man with a cane and a woman running late to lunch with friends, walk toward each other on St. Felix Street. Across the street, piano chords tinkle from behind a sign that says, \u201cBrooklyn Music School and Playhouse.\u201d The two strangers are about to pass each other when the man with the cane looks up and straight in the woman\u2019s eye. \u201cYou walk by the theater,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they\u2019re not gonna let you in.\u201d The woman half-laughs, eager for a punch line. After a beat, the man speaks again. \u201cYou know why they\u2019re not gonna let you in?\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t got any talent!\u201d His belly shakes with laughter as walks on. The woman laughs, too. How did he know I was a playwright?", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/nyregion/metropolitan-diary-everyones-a-critic-on-st-felix-street.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:05-04:00", "abstract": "A scene between two strangers on a sidewalk in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn.", "title": "Everyone\u2019s a Critic on St. Felix Street"}
