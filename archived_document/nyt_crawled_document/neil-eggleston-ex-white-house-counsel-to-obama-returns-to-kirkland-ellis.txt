Mr. Eggleston, 63, was a partner at Kirkland, a 1,900-lawyer corporate law firm, in 2014 when Mr. Obama named him to the White House post. In that job, he advised the president on legal and constitutional issues involving foreign policy and domestic matters, including congressional investigations, the judicial selection and appointments process, government ethics and petitions for clemency. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to have had the opportunity to serve in the White House under President Obama, and am looking forward to returning to Kirkland & Ellis, private practice and teaching once again,\u201d Mr. Eggleston said in a statement. Mr. Eggleston has spent much of his career representing clients facing questioning in congressional, regulatory and criminal inquiries. As a lawyer working in President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, he represented the Office of the President in investigations related to the Whitewater land deal and Mr. Clinton\u2019s relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Mr. Eggleston also represented Federico F. Pena, a transportation secretary in the Clinton administration, and, later, Alexis M. Herman, a labor secretary under Mr. Clinton, in corruption inquiries that did not result in charges. \u201cNeil has answered the call to serve in important government roles throughout his exceptional career,\u201d said Gene Assaf, a litigation partner in Kirkland\u2019s Washington office and a member of the firm\u2019s global management executive committee. \u201cHe is a lawyer\u2019s lawyer and an intellectual heavyweight.\u201d During the presidential transition from 2008 to 2009, Mr. Eggleston represented Mr. Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, during an inquiry into whether Rod R. Blagojevich, the governor of Illinois at the time, had tried to sell an appointment to fill the Senate seat that Mr. Obama vacated to become president. Mr. Eggleston also represented Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, amid a congressional inquiry into a mortgage he received from Countrywide Financial. Another prominent client was Sara M. Taylor, a White House political affairs director in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Ms. Taylor faced questions from a congressional oversight committee that was looking into the mass firings of United States attorneys. Earlier in his career, Mr. Eggleston was deputy chief counsel to a congressional committee investigating the Iran-contra affair involving covert arms transactions. In that role, he led the questioning of witnesses, including Caspar W. Weinberger, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first secretary of defense. Mr. Eggleston is a graduate of Duke University and the Northwestern University School of Law. He was a clerk for Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, and served as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he later became the chief appellate attorney. Before joining Kirkland in 2012, he was a partner with the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.", "published_date": "2017-04-23T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "abstract": "Mr. Eggleston, who advised President Barack Obama on legal and constitutional issues involving foreign policy, ethics and judicial appointments, is rejoining the law firm as a partner in Washington.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/business/dealbook/neil-eggleston-ex-white-house-counsel-to-obama-returns-to-kirkland-ellis.html", "source": "The New York Times"}
