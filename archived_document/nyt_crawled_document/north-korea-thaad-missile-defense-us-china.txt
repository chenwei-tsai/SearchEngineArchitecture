{"text": "HONG KONG \u2014 The antimissile system that the United States deployed in South Korea over China\u2019s objections is close to becoming operational, giving the two allies the capability to defend against missile attacks by the North, the South\u2019s Defense Ministry said on Thursday. The United States deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, known as Thaad, in South Korea in early March, after the North fired four missiles into the Sea of Japan. Beijing has vigorously opposed the system, fearing it could give the American military the ability to quickly detect and track missiles launched in China. On Thursday, Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry, said the system would soon go into \u201cactual operation.\u201d \u201cThe positioning of some equipment means that South Korea and the U.S. have the capability to cope with North Korea\u2019s provocations,\u201d he said, referring to the North\u2019s growing missile capabilities. The comments by Mr. Moon followed remarks by Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., commander of the United States Pacific Command, who told a congressional hearing in Washington on Wednesday that Thaad would become operational \u201cin the coming days.\u201d The United States deployed radar and other crucial components of Thaad in Seongju, 135 miles southeast of Seoul, this week. Alarmed by the development, China\u2019s Ministry of National Defense said on Thursday that the antimissile system would undermine its own security, underlining Beijing\u2019s persistent concerns about Thaad being placed into operation so close by. \u201cThe real goal of the United States and South Korea in deploying Thaad is as a move in the game of the United States\u2019 global antimissile defense system,\u201d Maj. Gen. Cai Jun, a senior officer in the Joint Staff Department of China\u2019s Central Military Commission, said at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday, the Chinese Ministry of Defense said online. \u201cThis will further tighten the Asia-Pacific antimissile barrier enclosing China and Russia, and will weaken their strategic capacities \u2014 something we adamantly oppose.\u201d General Cai said that broader American antimissile plans \u201care in fact seeking an absolute unilateral military advantage, and this will exacerbate regional tensions, triggering localized antagonism and even an all-out arms race, and ultimately this will damage global and regional strategic stability.\u201d Late Wednesday, a report emerged from North Korea about soaring gas prices and hoarding of fuel in the capital, Pyongyang. The Associated Press, which employs one of the few Western reporters based there, said that a kilogram of gas, which had cost 70 to 80 cents, was now selling for $1.40 at one station, and that the apparent shortage had led to rumors that China was behind the problem. The Trump administration has been encouraging Beijing to put economic pressure on North Korea to curtail its nuclear and missile tests, and the Chinese state news media recently hinted that the government would cut off fuel supplies if Pyongyang conducted its sixth atomic detonation.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/asia/north-korea-thaad-missile-defense-us-china.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:43:09-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:43:09-04:00", "abstract": "The so-called Thaad system, deployed over China\u2019s objections as a defense against North Korea, will soon go into \u201cactual operation,\u201d a South Korean official said.", "title": "U.S. Antimissile System in South Korea Is Said to Be Nearly Operational"}
