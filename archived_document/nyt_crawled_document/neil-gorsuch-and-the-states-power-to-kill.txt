Urgent matters arise unexpectedly, and the court must sometimes act quickly. Still, it\u2019s worth paying special attention to Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s vote late Thursday night to deny a stay of execution for Ledell Lee, an Arkansas man who was sentenced to death in 1995 for murdering a woman named Debra Reese with a tire thumper. After Justice Gorsuch, along with the four other conservative justices, denied his final appeal without explanation, Mr. Lee, who maintained his innocence until the end, was executed by lethal injection. He was pronounced dead at 11:56 p.m. Central Daylight Time, minutes before his death warrant expired. Arkansas had not executed anyone since 2005. In short, the first significant decision by Justice Gorsuch, who was sworn in to office less than two weeks ago, was the most consequential any justice can make \u2014 to approve a man\u2019s killing by the state. That man, like so many others condemned to die around the country, was a walking catalog of reasons the American death penalty is a travesty. Evidence that Mr. Lee was intellectually disabled and suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome was never introduced into court, mainly because he had egregiously bad representation. One of his lawyers was so drunk in court that a federal judge reviewing the case later said he could tell simply by reading the transcripts. In addition to raising these issues in his appeals to the justices, Mr. Lee challenged Arkansas\u2019s lethal-injection drug protocol, which incorporates a sedative, midazolam, that has been implicated in multiple botched executions. For both moral and business reasons, drug makers have banned the use of their products for state-sanctioned killing, making it harder for states to get their hands on them. In fact, Arkansas initially scheduled Mr. Lee\u2019s execution as part of an unprecedented killing spree \u2014 eight inmates over the course of 11 days \u2014 because the state\u2019s old batch of midazolam was about to expire. (As of Friday afternoon, four of those executions had been placed on hold by the courts, for various reasons.) This rush to kill based solely on a \u201cuse-by\u201d date is \u201cclose to random,\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer wrote on Thursday in dissenting from the court\u2019s refusal to stay Mr. Lee\u2019s execution. The three more liberal justices agreed that the stay should have been granted, as they regularly do in such cases, just as the conservative justices regularly vote the other way. That 4-to-4 split effectively gave the deciding vote over Mr. Lee\u2019s life to Justice Gorsuch, sitting in a seat that by all rights should be occupied not by him but by President Barack Obama\u2019s doomed nominee, Merrick Garland. During his confirmation hearings, Justice Gorsuch talked a lot about his respect for the rule of law, and the importance of sticking to the plain text of the Constitution and of statutes. But he didn\u2019t have to rewrite the Eighth Amendment to see, as Justice Breyer did, that Mr. Lee\u2019s case exemplified \u201chow the arbitrary nature of the death penalty system, as presently administered, runs contrary to the very purpose of a \u2018rule of law.\u2019 \u201d Neil Gorsuch held the power of life and death in his hands Thursday night. His choice led to Ledell Lee\u2019s execution, and gave the nation an early, and troubling, look into the mind-set of the high court\u2019s newest member.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T21:35:23-04:00", "abstract": "The Supreme Court\u2019s newest member just cast his first vote, to deny a stay of execution.", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T23:35:43-04:00"}
