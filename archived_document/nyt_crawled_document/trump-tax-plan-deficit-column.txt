{"text": "During his campaign, Donald J. Trump embraced the cause of fiscal responsibility and accused President Barack Obama of shackling the country with a \u201cmountain of debt.\u201d Mr. Obama \u201cdoubled our national debt. Doubled it,\u201d Mr. Trump claimed in a speech in Virginia Beach. Then on Wednesday, Mr. Trump unveiled the outlines of his much-anticipated tax overhaul, calling for steep tax cuts with only modest offsetting revenue increases. Economists I spoke to this week estimate it would add trillions to the national debt over the next decade. \u201cWe\u2019ve only done the rough numbers, but this looks like a tax cut of a magnitude of about $5 trillion,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy organization for fiscal responsibility whose chairman is former Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, a Republican. \u201cThat is simply unimaginable given our fiscal situation and the size of the deficit, which is already the worst since World War II.\u201d The sense of incredulity was widely shared. \u201cPaul Ryan and Kevin Brady must be beside themselves in private,\u201d said Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, referring to the House speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee chairman. \u201cThey put in years of work on a tax reform plan that at least tried to be revenue-neutral,\u201d meaning tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes, \u201cand wouldn\u2019t explode the deficit.\u201d Or as Steven M. Rosenthal, a business tax expert and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, put it: \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s plan basically is tax cuts for everyone. Real reform, with revenue neutrality, is difficult. There are winners and losers, but Trump apparently just wants winners.\u201d Tax cuts, as opposed to tax reform, are easy, Ms. MacGuineas agreed: \u201cWho doesn\u2019t love a tax cut, especially if no one has to pay for it? This is a free-lunch mentality.\u201d That Mr. Trump would embrace such a cut-now, pay-later approach probably shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise, considering the Trump Organization\u2019s reliance on borrowed money. \u201cI\u2019m the king of debt,\u201d Mr. Trump said last year on CNN. \u201cI love debt.\u201d Just how much Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would cost the government is hard to determine, given the sketchy details. But the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that two prospective elements \u2014 reducing individual rates to three brackets of 35, 25 and 10 percent, and cutting the tax rate for corporations and pass-through entities (businesses that pay taxes at individual rates) to 15 percent \u2014 would cost the Treasury $4 trillion to $6 trillion over 10 years, said Alan Cole, an economist at the foundation. The Urban-Brookings Tax Center estimated the cost of the cuts Mr. Trump proposed during the campaign at $6.2 trillion, assuming no additional growth, and just under $6 trillion when growth is factored in. Mr. Trump also wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, each of which would cost the Treasury hundreds of millions in revenue. The administration\u2019s proposal was silent on some critical aspects of any tax plan, such as the treatment of capital expenditures for business. Mr. Trump has said he strongly supports immediate expensing of capital expenditures, which many economists agree would encourage growth. The Tax Foundation estimates that such a change from current depreciation schedules would cost the Treasury $2.2 trillion over 10 years. That would raise the 10-year revenue loss to well over $8 trillion. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal did nod in the direction of raising revenue by calling for elimination of all deductions, save those for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and retirement savings. The major deduction not mentioned \u2014 and evidently jettisoned \u2014 is the one for state and local taxes. (And it\u2019s probably no coincidence that the states that would be hit hardest, like New York and California, overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton.) Mr. Cole said eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes would add about $2 trillion of revenue over 10 years. But the Trump plan didn\u2019t address other possible sources of revenue, such as eliminating the interest deduction for businesses or imposing a border tax. Both are key elements of the Republican House plan, but have drawn fierce opposition from the powerful real estate and retail lobbies. The Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, suggested that the plan would \u201cpay for itself\u201d by bolstering economic growth and tax receipts. But no economist I spoke to this week \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 said growth could compensate for an increase in the deficit of anywhere near the magnitude of $4 trillion to $6 trillion. \u201cI want a plan that\u2019s focused on growth as much as anyone,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who served as director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative pro-growth advocacy group. \u201cBut these tax cuts are not going to pay for themselves. If you believe that, you\u2019re kidding yourself.\u201d While economists debate the impact of vast additional government borrowing on debt markets, most argue it would drive up interest rates, curbing the very growth the cuts were intended to foster. \u201cBorrowing trillions of dollars eventually shows up in financial markets,\u201d Mr. Burman said. \u201cIt will almost certainly push up interest rates.\u201d And the effect would come at a time when the Federal Reserve is already raising interest rates, even without the impact of new federal borrowing. \u201cWe\u2019re very vulnerable to higher rates,\u201d Ms. MacGuineas said. \u201cEvery 1 percent increase in interest rates adds $160 billion a year to our existing interest payments. Interest is already the fastest-growing portion of the federal budget.\u201d She, too, argued that a big increase in federal borrowing would push up interest rates, undermining growth \u201cor even causing negative growth.\u201d The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that when additional interest payments were included, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign tax proposals would add $7.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $20.9 trillion by 2036. \u201cThe losers are future generations,\u201d said Mr. Rosenthal \u2014 as Republicans have long argued. Given the huge impact on the deficit, no one I spoke to expects Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to be enacted without significant modifications. \u201cI don\u2019t think a tax cut of anywhere near this size can make it through Congress,\u201d Ms. MacGuineas said. \u201cThere are varying degrees of commitment to getting our fiscal affairs under control among members of Congress, and there are some Republicans who only use the argument against Democrats. But there are others who are very serious about it.\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin agreed. \u201cThere are many Republicans who genuinely care about deficits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey recognize that you can\u2019t create permanent tax reform if you\u2019re blowing up the deficit. \u201c He added: \u201cI think this is an opening salvo. With this president, everything is a negotiation, and this is his opening bid.\u201d Even that prospect is worrisome, Ms. MacGuineas said. \u201cThese numbers are so huge, they almost lose meaning,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start negotiating about adding $5 trillion to the deficit and $1 trillion starts to sound reasonable. But that shouldn\u2019t even be on the table without a plan to get the deficit under control.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/business/economy/trump-tax-plan-deficit-column.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T12:01:42-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T11:55:01-04:00", "abstract": "A president who campaigned as a fiscal scold offers a tax overhaul that many experts say would mean trillions in lost revenue, and new borrowing, in the next decade.", "title": "Economists Fear Trump\u2019s Tax Plan Only Heightens a \u2018Mountain of Debt\u2019"}
