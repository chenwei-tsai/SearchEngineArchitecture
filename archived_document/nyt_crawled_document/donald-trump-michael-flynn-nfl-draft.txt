{"text": "Good morning. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 A choice for the G.O.P. The broad Republican support this week for President Trump\u2019s plan to sharply reduce taxes suggests that those concerned about growing national debt will have to face off with former allies who want to chase economic growth. The president\u2019s plan would shift trillions of dollars to America\u2019s richest families and add to the \u201cmountain of debt\u201d that he criticized Barack Obama for increasing. Do you own or plan to buy a home? Answer that and 11 other questions to find out how the tax plan might affect you. \u2022 A deadline missed. An 11th-hour push to give President Trump an early legislative victory broke down late on Thursday as House Republican leaders failed to round up enough support for a revised bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The president\u2019s 100th day in office is Saturday. One of our White House correspondents takes a video tour of the state of his campaign promises. Our reporters checked back in with voters across the country with whom they spoke after the election. Many of the president\u2019s biggest supporters like what they see so far. \u2022 A warning from Trump. The president warned on Thursday of the possibility of a \u201cmajor, major conflict\u201d with North Korea, saying in an interview that he was seeking a diplomatic solution to concerns that Pyongyang is preparing another nuclear test. \u2022 More trouble for Flynn. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, was told in 2014 to seek approval for any payments he accepted from a foreign government, documents released on Thursday show. He didn\u2019t. \u2022 Welcome to Weimar. The German city, population 65,000, has absorbed 900 refugees in a year. Our journalists spent months there examining their integration from all sides. In today\u2019s 360 video, step inside the home of Sarah, a German, and Omar, a refugee, to see how they are adjusting. \u2022 \u201cThe Daily,\u201d your audio news report. In today\u2019s show, we discuss what we can we learn about the Trump administration from the taxes it would cut. Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. \u2022 The Fox News anchor Sean Hannity has vocally defended an executive at the center of a growing culture clash inside the network. Separately, our reporters spoke to Fox News viewers across the country, who disagree about the circumstances that led to the departure of Bill O\u2019Reilly. One thing they agree on: They\u2019ll stick with Fox. \u2022 United Airlines has reached a settlement with David Dao, a passenger who was dragged off one of its flights. It did not disclose the amount. \u2022 U.S. stocks were up on Thursday. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Skip the university tour. Research suggests that talking to former students is a better guide. \u2022 Turn up the music to make a strenuous workout feel easier. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Treat yourself to shrimp tossed in a butter and chili sauce. \u2022 Partisan writing you shouldn\u2019t miss. Read how the other side thinks: Debating the resonance of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d why the left should tolerate anti-abortion Democrats, and why the media bubble is worse than you thought. \u2022 A return to offense. After years of focus on linemen and defense, offensive players were the favorites in the opening round of the N.F.L. draft. We analyzed every pick from Thursday night, including the No. 1, Myles Garrett. \u2022 Here comes the weekend. Five of our art critics fanned across New York City to compile a guide to 47 favorite galleries. (Just don\u2019t expect a break from politics.) In a video review, our movie critics discuss this week\u2019s releases, including \u201cThe Circle\u201d and \u201cCasting JonBenet.\u201d We also have television suggestions, and 10 new books to recommend. \u2022 Small appreciations. Like you, we at the Morning Briefing can have a lot going on, and sometimes there isn\u2019t room for all The Times has to offer. Today, we\u2019d like to catch up with some of our favorites from The Times Magazine: \u2022 Dorie Greenspan, an award-winning cookbook author, begins a new column, all about desserts. \u2022 The Ethicist discusses whether it\u2019s O.K. to get a pet from a no-kill shelter. \u2022 And we talk with the founders of theSkimm, a \u201cgateway drug\u201d to the news that\u2019s popular with young women (and the writer of this briefing). \u2022 Also: How to avoid icebergs. \u2022 Best of late-night TV.

Was that Donald Trump in the host\u2019s chair? \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d the eighth installment of the action movie franchise starring Vin Diesel, opened in Japanese theaters today. But you\u2019d be forgiven for not finding it on cinema schedules there. In Japan, the movie is called \u201cWild Speed: Ice Break.\u201d This is not the first time that films in the franchise have been promoted under different names. Movie titles are frequently changed to resonate better with local audiences. In Japan, the sixth \u201cFast and Furious\u201d movie, which focused on Europe, was advertised as \u201cWild Speed: Euro Mission.\u201d The seventh, \u201cWild Speed: Sky Mission,\u201d included a scene featuring cars falling from a plane. If the latest film\u2019s performance in China (where it is called \u201cSpeed and Passion\u201d) is any guide, changing movie titles can bolster ticket sales. Of the $432 million it made outside the U.S. on its opening weekend, $190 million came from China. In Hong Kong, the movie was named \u201cWild Speed,\u201d and in Taiwan \u201cThe Moment You Play With Death.\u201d (In Europe, the title was more literal: \u201cFast and Furious 8.\u201d) Regardless of where you might be, here\u2019s our review of the film.
