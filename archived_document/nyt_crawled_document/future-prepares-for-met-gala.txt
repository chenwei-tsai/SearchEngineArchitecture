{"text": "You see a lot while waiting for Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, a.k.a. Future, at the Carlyle Hotel on the first Monday of May. You see, for example, Mel Ottenberg, Rihanna\u2019s longtime collaborator, carrying in bags to the singer\u2019s 15th-floor suite to complete her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons look. You see Jenna Lyons, the former J. Crew creative director, in the lobby checking in. And you see Jennifer Connelly stepping out of a car in a short Louis Vuitton frock while photographers lining the entrance yell her name. You see all of this because this isn\u2019t just any Monday in May. It\u2019s the day of the Met Gala. And the Carlyle is the epicenter of preparations for the fashion industry\u2019s elite. In that context, Future\u2019s room is pretty much a microcosm of the action taking place all over the hotel. \u201cBobby picked it; he had to convince me to wear it,\u201d Future said of the H&M suit he was planning to wear to the ball (\u201cBobby\u201d being his stylist, Bobby Wesley Williams, who was tying a bow on his organic silk shirt). \u201cI feel good about it, I feel great about it,\u201d Future continued. Simon Hallin, a developer from H&M\u2019s design team who had flown in from Sweden, reached over to help him pin down the bow. This would be the third time Future was attending the Met Gala. Last year, he wore a custom Ermenegildo Zegna suit, and in 2014, he wore a Calvin Klein suit by Italo Zucchelli, with whom he attended the event. This year, to pay homage to Rei Kawakubo, who was being honored, he chose a black tailcoat jacket embellished with a black skull and Swarovski crystal heart that was inspired by the Japanese designer. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s more artistic, more dramatic,\u201d Future said of his look this year. Mr. Williams, while keeping his eye on the fitting, said: \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t want to be in a traditional-type suit. It\u2019s mellow, cool and super-edgy. Taking more chances.\u201d \u201cIs this bow tie supposed to be off?\u201d Future asked while carefully inspecting the alignment of the shirt\u2019s tie in the mirror. Mr. Williams replied, \u201cYou know, with your earrings, it\u2019s more rock star.\u201d From the rapper\u2019s ear hung a safety-pin earring from Enfants Riches D\u00e9prim\u00e9s. \u201cHe\u2019s from Atlanta; that\u2019s my boy,\u201d Future said of the brand\u2019s designer, Henry Levy. Mr. Hallin was still thinking about the bow. \u201cIt\u2019s sustainable as well,\u201d he chimed in. Future, who is known for his outr\u00e9 style and accessories, added a pair of gold Bottega Veneta glasses to complete his look. He has 150 to 200 pairs of sunglasses, Mr. Williams guessed. The rapper would describe his look as \u201cversatile,\u201d and when asked, he could rattle off his favorite designers without missing a beat: \u201cSaint Laurent jeans, Balmain jeans, Chanel \u2026 Chanel is my favorite. Tom Ford, Linda Farrow shades, Valentino, Loewe, Stella McCartney, Dior, Bottega.\u201d He\u2019s particularly into Gucci socks right now, too, though he thinks the brand is becoming \u201ctoo trendy\u201d for him. \u201cIt\u2019s always a fashion-forward event of what\u2019s to come,\u201d Future said of Vogue\u2019s annual gala. \u201cThat\u2019s why you go to fashion shows; it\u2019s all about setting a trend. So that\u2019s what the Met Gala is great for.\u201d And setting a trend is very important to Future. \u201cMy style is always evolving because I\u2019m always getting inspired,\u201d he said. \u201cYou evolve with time. It\u2019s like a process when it comes to fashion.\u201d To help, Mr. Williams scours Pinterest and Vogue.com in his free time researching up-and-coming labels like Martine Rose, Amiri and Fear of God. So what if Future could choose the theme of the Met Gala for next year? \u201cI would want to see vintage style, like \u201970s-style vintage,\u201d he said. The time was creeping very near to 5:30 p.m., and Future still had to make his way to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he would show up arm in arm with the model Jourdan Dunn, whose dress was also H&M. \u201cThe girls, they take forever,\u201d he said. He picked up a glass of white wine before heading out. \u201cThey just need to get drunk before they go, that\u2019s my advice,\u201d he said of how he would describe the Met Gala to someone who has never been there. \u201cBe there but don\u2019t be there.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/fashion/future-prepares-for-met-gala.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T11:05:14-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T11:05:05-04:00", "abstract": "We got ready with Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, a.k.a.
