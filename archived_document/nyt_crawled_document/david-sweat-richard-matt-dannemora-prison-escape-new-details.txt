{"text": "When the two men plunged into the unforgiving wilderness of the Adirondacks, they had scant experience and supplies better suited to boys running away from home than to convicted killers fleeing a maximum-security prison: pepperoni sticks, toilet paper, a cache of black pepper, an electric shaver and 40 granola bars, all packed in a cloth guitar case. But they managed to avoid capture for three weeks in the rugged northernmost reaches of New York State. Navigating by the stars and using evasion tactics gleaned from Vietnam War movies, they pillaged peanut butter and pasta \u2014 as well as moonshine and marijuana \u2014 from remote hunting cabins. They stole sleep by the hour and tracked their pursuers\u2019 movements via news reports on a purloined transistor radio. In the end, feet worn bloody by flight, they argued and went their separate ways before their bids for freedom ended \u2014 one in capture, one in death. The escape of David Sweat and Richard W. Matt in June 2015 from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y., captivated the nation. And much of the tale has since been told: how they patiently planned their escape; how they manipulated the affections of a female prison employee; how they broke out of the prison, one of the state\u2019s toughest. But little has been disclosed about what it was actually like for the two hunted men during their 30-mile slog in the deep woods between the prison and the Canadian border. The survivor, Mr. Sweat, has told their story in novelistic detail \u2014 it reads like a new twist on a grand wilderness adventure \u2014 to investigators from the New York State Police, the state inspector general\u2019s office and the state prison agency in a series of interviews that began from his hospital bed the day he was captured. It is contained in more than 500 pages of transcripts. It is the drama as seen from the vantage point of the hunted, the police and dogs always just one step behind, hopscotching from rural roads to rutted mountainsides, dragging themselves through swamps and up and down steep inclines. The men cobbled together their supplies from what was available inside the maximum-security prison \u2014 \u201cYou plan for the worst, hope for the best,\u201d Mr. Sweat said \u2014 amassing a supply of black pepper he later used to throw dogs off his scent, along with a shaver so they would not look like bearded fugitives. Much of the time the two men spent cold, wet, shivering nights sleeping on the ground or in elevated hunting blinds, platforms hidden high in the trees from which hunters stalk and shoot their prey, a perch from which Mr. Sweat said in one instance he could identify the search area by watching helicopters and planes above. But they also spent some time in rough-hewed cabins used by hunters, at least some of which belong to state corrections officers who work in the prisons like Clinton, Mr. Sweat said. It was in one cabin that they found the moonshine and marijuana, which, along with a propane heater and an ample supply of food, would allow them to stay for two nights. In another officer\u2019s camp, they found a shotgun, which they took, and uniform jackets belonging to the corrections officers, which they apparently did not. \u201cI found their weed and everything,\u201d Mr. Sweat, 36, told his interrogators, referring to the first cabin. \u201cI was laughing my ass \u2014 because I like to smoke weed every once in a while. It mellows me out, keeps me calm.\u201d A senior investigator with the State Police asked if they had smoked any that night. \u201cYes, we got high as hell for like two nights,\u201d he said, adding that they also drank the moonshine. \u201cSo you know we\u2019d drink, get high and hang out because there ain\u2019t nobody coming up here during the week.\u201d The two convicted killers practically played house. \u201cWe\u2019d turn the heaters on and we\u2019d cook,\u201d Mr. Sweat recalled. \u201cWe made pasta and everything else because they had pasta there, because we didn\u2019t care \u2014 it was the C.O.s,\u2019\u201d he said, using the shorthand for corrections officers, noting they were unlikely to report the break-in because of the marijuana. The transcripts of the interviews were obtained under the state\u2019s Freedom of Information Law. They reveal Mr. Sweat as an enthusiastic raconteur, eager to regale his questioners with his backwoods accomplishments and his MacGyver-like skills of improvisation. He was also quick to vent his apparent frustration with what he characterized as his sluggish, foolhardy and sometimes drunken fellow escapee, Mr. Matt. \u201cI got in an argument with him because every place we\u2019d go, he\u2019d get drunk,\u201d Mr. Sweat complained. \u201cAnd he would drink when we were moving. I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, you can\u2019t be drunk when we\u2019re moving; you\u2019ve got to be sober.\u2019\u201d The two men found the transistor radio and a refrigerator full of beer at another cabin, Mr. Sweat told the investigators. And in addition to helping them keep track of where the authorities were searching for them, the radio also provided some measure of entertainment and satisfaction. \u201cIt was actually kind of a running joke between him and me because on the radio they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh they\u2019re not woodsmen, this and that,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sweat said. \u201cAnd we\u2019d laugh about it. It\u2019s funny \u2026 we\u2019re not woodsmen and we\u2019ve been in the woods for weeks.\u201d Then he gloated. \u201cThey can\u2019t catch us. But we\u2019re not woodsmen.\u201d Mr. Sweat said Mr. Matt, 49, had reckless ideas \u2014 shooting troopers, carjacking passers-by on the rural roads or sticking people up in their homes and taking their money and cars. After two weeks, Mr. Matt began to wear on him. With their hunters in hot pursuit, Mr. Sweat left him behind. \u201cI said, you know what, I hate to do it to him, but I kept my part of the deal, I got him out,\u201d he said, \u201cand I bolted on him.\u201d On June 26, a drunken Mr. Matt was confronted by a United States Border Patrol tactical unit, and, the authorities say, pointed a shotgun at one of its members. A federal agent shot him twice in the head and once in the neck. Two days later, Mr. Sweat was walking on a rural road just a mile and a half from the Canadian border when a sergeant in a State Police car approached him. Mr. Sweat believed the sergeant was confused because Mr. Sweat had shaved the night before as part of his plan for not looking like a haggard convict on the run. Mr. Sweat started to cross a field of alfalfa, heading for the tree line on the opposite side. The sergeant tried to call Mr. Sweat back to the road, saying, \u201cCome here.\u201d But Mr. Sweat responded with, \u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d and kept walking. He started moving faster. The sergeant swore at him. \u201cHe started running behind me,\u201d Mr. Sweat recalled. \u201cI took off. The next thing he says: \u2018I\u2019m going to shoot you. If you don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m going to shoot you.\u2019 I said: \u2018I ain\u2019t got no weapons. I don\u2019t have no weapons.\u2019\u201d Mr. Sweat said he held his hands up so the trooper could see he was unarmed, but he kept running. The tree line got closer. He dropped the bag he was carrying. The sergeant got down on one knee, carefully set up his shot and fired. \u201cHe hit me twice and it was \u2014 the first one hit me in the shoulder the top,\u201d Mr. Sweat said. \u201cIt killed this whole arm. I couldn\u2019t move it. And the other one was on the other side. I thought, \u2018Man, I\u2019m going to hit the ground,\u2019 and just started spitting blood up. He hit my lung.\u201d After Mr. Sweat recovered, he pleaded guilty to first-degree escape and promotion of prison contraband and was sentenced to three and a half to seven years in prison, on top of his life-without-parole sentence for the 2002 killing of a Broome County sheriff\u2019s deputy. He is currently in the Special Housing Unit at Five Points Correctional Facility in Romulus, N.Y., the state\u2019s newest maximum-security prison. Portions of Mr. Sweat\u2019s account could not be corroborated, with Mr. Matt, the only other witness to many of the events, dead. And while a report this summer by the state inspector general, Catherine Leahy-Scott, detailing the prison lapses that led to the escape in some measure relied on Mr. Sweat\u2019s account of the breakout itself, it acknowledged that questions would arise about his motivation and credibility. But the report noted that information he provided under oath had been corroborated, wherever possible, by other evidence, adding, \u201cIn instances where no independent corroboration exists, the inspector general has found Sweat\u2019s account credible and consistent with other known facts.\u201d", "published_date": "2016-09-16T20:00:00-04:00", "abstract": "Maybe breaking out of prison was the easy part.
