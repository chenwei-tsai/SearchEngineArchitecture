{"text": "Dominic Thiem upset the world No. 1 Andy Murray, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, at the Barcelona Open on Saturday to advance to the final against Rafael Nadal, the defending champion. Nadal returned to the final by beating Horacio Zeballos, 6-3, 6-4, after Thiem had dispatched Murray. Murray\u2019s defeat came a week after he lost in the third round at Monte Carlo, which prompted him to enter Barcelona to sharpen his game for the French Open. Nadal, a nine-time champion on Barcelona\u2019s clay, said that he \u201cwasn\u2019t surprised\u201d by Thiem\u2019s first win over Murray in three attempts. \u201cThiem is a specialist on clay, one of the best in the world,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cIt will be a tough match for me, but I am just happy to be back in the final.\u201d Thiem started strong, breaking Murray\u2019s first two service games before adding a third break en route to taking the first set. Thiem, ranked ninth, had a break point in the second set, but Murray held serve and broke him back to even the match at a set apiece. In the decisive set, Murray was down by 4-2 and folded when he failed to return Thiem\u2019s deep lob on match point. \u201cHe\u2019s the No. 1 in the world, so you have to find something in between playing aggressive and not making mistakes,\u201d Thiem said. \u201cI was the luckiest in the end.\u201d Thiem will be seeking his second title of the year and the eighth of his career. Nadal appeared set to roll past Zeballos, but he had to save five break points in windy conditions. Nadal won his 10th Monte Carlo title last weekend. Sunday\u2019s final will be his fifth of the season. The fourth round of the N.F.L. draft in Philadelphia featured a concentration of running backs, including Oklahoma\u2019s Samaje Perine to the Washington Redskins, Utah\u2019s Joe Williams to the San Francisco 49ers, and Donnel Pumphrey of San Diego State to the Philadelphia Eagles. Perine set the Football Bowl Subdivision rushing mark with 427 yards in a game against Kansas. The 5-foot-9 Pumphrey led the F.B.S. in rushing with 2,133 yards and is the F.B.S. career leader in rushing yards. The Giants joined the running back parade, selecting Clemson\u2019s Wayne Gallman, while the Jets picked California\u2019s Chad Hansen, a wide receiver. The Jets took Clemson tight end Jordan Leggett in the fifth round, and the Giants added defensive end Avery Moss of Youngstown State. Real Madrid needed a late goal by Marcelo to make up for Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s missed penalty kick and secure a 2-1 win over visiting Valencia. The victory kept Real Madrid on track for the Spanish league title. The victory left Madrid three points ahead of Barcelona, the defending champions, who were set to visit Espanyol later Saturday. Madrid also has a game in hand and can ensure its first league crown in five years if it wins its four remaining matches. BAYERN MUNICH WINS FIFTH STRAIGHT TITLE Bayern Munich clinched a record fifth successive Bundesliga title with a 6-0 victory over host Wolfsburg. Leipzig had opened the door for Bayern earlier on Saturday when it was held to to a scoreless draw by host Ingolstadt. SUNDERLAND RELEGATED Sunderland\u2019s 10-season stay in the Premier League is over. The team\u2019s relegation was confirmed with four games remaining after a 1-0 loss to visiting Bournemouth on a goal by Joshua King in the 88th minute. The loss, combined with Hull\u2019s 0-0 draw with host Southampton, sealed Sunderland\u2019s fate. AROUND THE PREMIER LEAGUE Stoke City and visiting West Ham United remained well clear of relegation after a 0-0 draw. Jamie Vardy extended his scoring streak to ease the relegation fears of Leicester, the defending champion, with a 1-0 win at West Bromwich. Vardy struck in the 43rd minute for his eighth goal in 12 matches. Sebastian Vettel stormed to the pole position for the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi, ending a run of 18 poles for Mercedes. Vettel, the Formula One leader, shaved 0.059 of a second off his Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen\u2019s leading time, claiming his, and Ferrari\u2019s, first pole since September 2015. Vettel will be shooting for his third win of the season on Sunday, which would increase his seven-point lead in the standings over Mercedes\u2019 Lewis Hamilton.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/sports/andy-murray-loses-in-a-semifinal-at-barcelona-open.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T15:54:36-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T15:54:36-04:00", "abstract": "Murray, the top-ranked player in the world, was upset by Dominic Thiem, who will face the defending champion Rafael Nadal in the final.", "title": "Andy Murray Loses in a Semifinal at Barcelona Open"}
