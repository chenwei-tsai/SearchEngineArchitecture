{"text": "When the composers\u2019 collective Bang on a Can alighted on the scene 30 years ago, one of its defining qualities was volume. Amplified to exuberant rock-music levels, works by its founding members, David Lang, Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon, typically featured a novel mix of electric guitars and traditional orchestral instruments. So it was a funny coincidence that these composers\u2019 microphones malfunctioned at the start of an onstage discussion at Zankel Hall on Wednesday. The first question, posed by Steve Reich \u2014 the evening was part of \u201cThree Generations,\u201d a series of concerts he has programmed exploring Minimalism\u2019s legacy \u2014 was almost inaudible. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you\u2019re closer to chaos,\u201d Mr. Lang answered, as technicians fiddled with the sound. \u201cNow I move slower. I\u2019ve got kids, I have health insurance.\u201d Unplugged, soft-spoken and unchaotic \u2014 parents now, rather than children \u2014 is a good summary of the Bang on a Can founders these days, even as their energy is undimmed. Their work, once punkishly outsiderish, is now showered with mainstream accolades. Mr. Lang and Ms. Wolfe have both won the Pulitzer Prize in the past decade; Ms. Wolfe has added to it a MacArthur Fellowship. The shifts in their styles \u2014 toward a greater restraint, and perhaps even maturation \u2014 were obvious from the earlier works performed on Wednesday by the Bang on a Can All-Stars ensemble. Mr. Lang\u2019s Pulitzer, for example, came in 2008 for his quietly chilling \u201cLittle Match Girl Passion,\u201d an ethereal cantata light years removed from his brake-drum-clanging \u201ccheating, lying, stealing,\u201d from 1995, performed with raucous verve at Zankel. Mr. Gordon\u2019s recent compositions include hyperkinetic works for acoustic instruments (bassoons, planks of wood) that uncannily evoke electronic music. These often have a meditative quality completely at odds with his \u201cYo Shakespeare,\u201d from 1992, which the All-Stars also played, and that sounds like a marching band weaving through a honk-happy traffic jam on a hot day. Ms. Wolfe\u2019s pumped-up-funk \u201cLick\u201d (1994) was a bracing reminder of the raw sass of her music in the early 1990s, before she incorporated her earlier interest in folk into works like her searing \u201cAnthracite Fields,\u201d which won the Pulitzer in 2015. The collective was born in 1987 when the three friends (Mr. Gordon and Ms. Wolfe are also married) put on a marathon concert of new music that brought together composers who had until then inhabited separate, even hostile, orbits. Mr. Reich, for instance, found himself programmed back to back with the serialist and computer-music pioneer Milton Babbitt. The annual marathon is still at the heart of Bang on a Can, even as the organization has grown to include a record label, a summer camp, the Bang on a Can All-Stars ensemble, a commissioning program and even an avant-garde marching band. This year\u2019s marathon will take place on May 6 at the Brooklyn Museum, featuring eight hours of live music encompassing works by the founders as well as Iraqi maqam music, a Brooklyn-based collective dedicated to the Moroccan gnawa tradition, and \u201cA Murmuration for Chibok\u201d by the vocalist Joan La Barbara, in memory of the abduction, by Boko Haram, of Nigerian schoolgirls. The marathon lineup suggests that the aesthetic struggle of the 1980s have given way to more overtly political ones. Back then the walls that Bang on a Can sought to breach were institutional and ideological, like the persistent division of New York\u2019s new-music scene into an academic uptown camp grounded in European modernism and a scruffy, experimental one downtown. \u201cThere was a reluctance to acknowledge others,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said before the concert on Wednesday. Mr. Lang added that even expressing admiration for a Minimalist composer like Mr. Reich was considered incendiary in a conservatory setting: \u201cBack then, those were fighting words.\u201d The divisions Bang on a Can tackle now are political and social. Ms. Wolfe\u2019s \u201cAnthracite Fields\u201d is part of a series of works honoring the history of blue-collar workers in America; both Mr. Gordon and Mr. Lang have composed pieces that focus on national anthems. But they also maintain that their efforts to build new audiences and to bring together seemingly incompatible musical styles is itself political. \u201cThe problems we face today have to do with people trying to divide the world into small groups that have nothing to do with each other,\u201d Mr. Lang said. \u201cSomeone needs to articulate the reasons why we need each other. Art does that.\u201d That artists also need each other on a practical and personal level is central to the Bang on a Can ethos. The founders on Wednesday pointed to specific musical decisions they made based on each other\u2019s advice. The nearly minute-long chord held at the end of Ms. Wolfe\u2019s string quartet \u201cEarly that summer\u201d was Mr. Lang\u2019s idea; the bringing back of the heartbreaking stammer motif evoking the freezing child in his \u201cLittle Match Girl Passion\u201d was hers. At their summer camp in the Berkshires, nicknamed Banglewood to wink at the Boston Symphony\u2019s Tanglewood, they encourage young participants to band together in their own collectives. The American new-music scene is now dotted with dozens of Bang on a Can alumni groups, among them New Amsterdam Records, the Ecstatic Music Festival, Mantra Percussion, Dither, Ekmeles and Hotel Elefant and another composers\u2019 collective, Sleeping Giant. Perhaps the most radical notion that has taken root thanks to Bang on a Can is that of success through generosity, with composers attending each other\u2019s concerts, playing each other\u2019s music and founding record labels that foster new voices. Asked to name the biggest difference between the music scenes of the \u201980s and today, Mr. Lang had a ready answer: \u201cComposers are nice to each other.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/arts/music/at-30-bang-on-a-can-still-seethes-with-energy.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T15:21:02-04:00", "abstract": "The new-music collective appears at Zankel Hall and is preparing for its annual marathon, on May 6, at the Brooklyn Museum.", "title": "At 30, Bang on a Can Still Seethes With Energy", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Arts", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T15:21:02-04:00"}
