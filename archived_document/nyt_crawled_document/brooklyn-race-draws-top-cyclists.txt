{"text": "David August Trimble first held the Red Hook Criterium in March 2008 on the sleepy streets of Red Hook, Brooklyn, with about 40 cyclists on bikes intended for a velodrome. It was informal and unsanctioned, with little vision for the future. \u201cThe first year it was just, \u2018How do I make a race that\u2019s super fun and gets people to come to my birthday party?\u2019\u201d Trimble said. But Trimble, who has a background in auto racing, eventually turned his attention toward making the race a yearly event. \u201cIn my head, the idea was to create the Formula One of bike racing,\u201d he said. Trimble\u2019s goal is to create a spectacle, despite grumblings that the race is becoming detached from its roots. On Saturday night, a warm breeze carried Trimble\u2019s voice from the booming loudspeakers across the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal as he counted down the start for 100 riders in the 10th Red Hook Criterium, now a well-loved fixed-gear bike race known as the Red Hook Crit. No longer a chaotic street race, the event is contested on a winding, closed-circuit course just over a kilometer long, featuring tight chicanes, sweeping turns and high-speed straightaways. Kacey Lloyd won the first Red Hook Crit and competed in several more, often placing in the top 10 of what was until 2014 a coed event. Lloyd, who now oversees the race\u2019s website, said she welcomed the race\u2019s evolution. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a bunch of yahoos in the street anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more structure around it. Some people think that\u2019s a bad thing. I think it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d The planning eventually became so time consuming that Lloyd and Trimble stopped competing in the event. Red Hook took a major turn toward becoming a more well-oiled, professional event in 2013 when Rockstar Games, a video game company, signed on as the title sponsor. In the preceding years, registration was limited to 100 riders on a first-come-first-served basis, and there were no qualifying races. The sponsorship allowed the organizers to accept more entries. That year, starting with the opening race in Brooklyn, the crit expanded to a four-race series. From 2010 to 2012, contests were held in Brooklyn and Milan. But with additional resources and growing interest in fixed-gear races, a stop in Barcelona and a second race at the Brooklyn Navy Yard were added. (The Navy Yard event was a one-time race, and a London race was added in 2015.) By 2014, there were enough cyclists to create a women\u2019s division. This year\u2019s crit had 279 men and 69 women complete qualifying. The top 100 men reached the final, while there were 60 spots in the women\u2019s final. What began as an underground night race among friends at the intersection of Richards and Dikeman Streets now attracts some of the world\u2019s top cyclists. The 2017 field included Colin Strickland, the 2016 series winner, who snagged three race victories with team Allez Allez-Specialized; Callum Skinner, a gold and silver medalist in track cycling for Britain at the 2016 Olympics; and the retired World Tour rider Francesco Chicchi of Italy. Francisca Campos, a former Olympic mountain biker from Chile, returned to Red Hook after finishing ninth in the 2016 women\u2019s standings. Trimble, 34, said he wanted to keep the race open to everyone, but acknowledged that rising performance levels made it difficult for all but the top riders. \u201cWhen we started, the high-level athletes were national track champions,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re gold medalists.\u201d The Red Hook race has also inspired similar fixed-gear criteriums in the United States and Europe. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about racing fixed-gear bikes without talking about the Red Hook Crit,\u201d said James Grady, the founder of San Francisco\u2019s Mission Crit. The Mission Crit held its fourth annual race a week before Red Hook\u2019s, and attracted some of the same riders. Zach Morvant, who competed at Mission and Red Hook, said more emphasis was placed on preparation than ever before. Morvant focuses on interval training, honing his track bike handling, and is attentive to nutrition. \u201cDrinking a beer before a race, that doesn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d he said. The increased participation meant adding structures such as qualifying heats and time trials to establish starting position. More racers also led to a greater focus on safety and course design. Red Hook has faced criticism for the risks of fixed-gear bikes racing at upward of 35 miles per hour, without brakes, on a course with multiple turns. A competitor sustained a shattered jaw in 2013. \u201cI\u2019ve adapted a lot of safety aspects from motor sports into this race,\u201d Trimble said. \u201cLike the way we use course marshals, and the way we use flags, and the way we use crash protection.\u201d In 2015, Trimble began working with Liam Worthy, a cycling consultant from London who worked at the 2012 Olympics. Some precautions include applying grip tape to areas of the track prone to tire slippage, and creating \u201csee throughs\u201d at corners using small orange concrete markers to lessen the risk of hitting the metal barriers enclosing the course. After each heat, Worthy rides the course to observe the conditions and make any adjustments. His team of marshals is positioned along the course and communicates safety hazards using flags, as in motor racing. Crashes are inevitable, though. Several occurred on Saturday, with the most serious in the men\u2019s final, which was red flagged with five laps left so medical staff could tend to an injured rider. The future of the Red Hook Crit will depend on reaching more spectators and keeping them engaged during a full day of racing, Trimble said. \u201cWhenever we pick a venue in another city, we really think, \u2018How can this grow?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to make bike racing spectator-friendly.\u201d The Red Hook race has built partnerships with food and drink vendors, and a five-kilometer race on the bike track was introduced in 2012. Live streaming is a likely next step in widening the crit\u2019s audience. \u201cWhen you\u2019re here in person, you feel that energy,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cWe have to figure out how to actually come remotely close to that on a screen. Doing it properly is a very expensive process.\u201d The organizers already broadcast the race on Jumbotrons at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal \u2014 just as Formula One does. The costs associated with bike races are often insurmountable. The Philadelphia International Cycling Classic, which began in 1985, was canceled this year because of a lack of funding. Trimble does not play down the financial obstacles. \u201cIt could keep going, or it could not,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are steps we need to take to make it viable. Every year it gets more expensive.\u201d Saturday\u2019s final race came down to the two breakaway riders, Strickland and Stefan Sch\u00e4fer of Germany. Sch\u00e4fer, who was the only rider to beat Strickland in the 2016 Red Hook series, took the victory on the final lap. A budding rivalry could be a good thing. \u201cI think it has huge potential,\u201d Trimble said. \u201cI think we have the right formula.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/sports/brooklyn-race-draws-top-cyclists.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T19:56:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T19:56:37-04:00", "abstract": "The Red Hook Crit began as an informal fixed-gear race in 2008.
