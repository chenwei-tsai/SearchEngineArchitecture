They almost always leave that way, too. The death penalty holds a crucial, conflicted place in a nation deeply divided over crime and punishment, and whether the state should ever take a life. But for such a long, very public legal process, only a small number of people see what unfolds inside the country\u2019s death houses. Witnesses hear a condemned prisoner\u2019s last words and watch a person\u2019s last breaths. Then they scatter, usually into the night. There is no uniformity when they look back on the emotions that surround the minutes when they watched someone die. The most recent person to be executed, Ledell Lee, died at the Cummins Unit here in southeast Arkansas late Thursday. By next Friday morning, the state hopes to have executed three more men. In separate phone interviews, five people who have witnessed executions \u2014 some years ago, one as recently as Mr. Lee\u2019s \u2014 reflected on what they had seen and what it meant to them. The interviews have been condensed and edited. Charles E. Coulson Witnessed two executions as prosecuting attorney for Lake County, Ohio In both cases, I was invited by the family to attend. The victim advocates sit down the night before, and you meet with them at dinner, and they go over step by step what\u2019s going to happen. They draw diagrams and show you where the death chamber is, where the defendant is going to be, where the defendant\u2019s family is going to be. You\u2019re watching through glass, and then the process starts. They had a chance to offer last statements, and I was disgusted because they were so self-serving, narcissistic statements for these people who had caused so much pain and suffering. We were just waiting for the signal; one time, it was when the warden touched his glasses. You\u2019re looking at the clock, but you\u2019re mostly watching the defendant, watching to see if he\u2019s still breathing or not. It is very quiet and respectful. It\u2019s not like watching a gory murder in a movie. When I watched the executions, I was very impressed with the State of Ohio and how dignified they handled this. In my opinion, these two defendants didn\u2019t deserve any dignity whatsoever. The only time that I was emotionally involved was when I had to make the decision, and I actually had to go and speak and tell the jury that this man, sitting in a room a few feet away from me, should be put to death for his crime. A prosecutor has to have no doubt: not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but no doubt that a person committed those crimes. As long as you have no doubt, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any valid argument against the death penalty. These were two evil people, and their executions did not bother me at all. It\u2019s what I thought they deserved. I don\u2019t think about it much. It was done. It should have been done. I don\u2019t really think about it. Gayle Gaddis Mother of Guy P. Gaddis, a murdered Houston police officer I wanted to be sure it was finished, and that\u2019s why I went. Before the execution, we were in a room without a clock. It\u2019s a terrible experience. We were there, it seemed, like hours, while they were making sure he didn\u2019t get a stay. We were all just miserable. Then the warden came in and said, \u201cGood news: There are no stays, and he\u2019s going to be gone,\u201d or something like that. I went in the room, and I saw him strapped on that gurney. Then I couldn\u2019t watch it. They gave me a chair, and I just turned it the other way. One son was kind of hitting his elbow against the glass. My other son asked why he was doing that. He said, \u201cI want him to look at me.\u201d Edgar Tamayo was his name, and he wouldn\u2019t look or speak or anything. I was hoping he\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t even look at us. It didn\u2019t hurt him: I would have liked to have stoned him to death or something horrible. He just got a shot like you were going to have some surgery. It was too easy, for all of the pain he caused my family all of these years. Right at the end, all of a sudden, there was the sound of motorcycles revving up that went through the walls. I realized it was the motorcycle policemen \u2014 support from the policemen \u2014 and it made my heart feel good. As we walked outside, his daughter was across the big driveway. She was holding up a great big sign: \u201cDon\u2019t kill my dad.\u201d I did feel sorry for her. He just ruined all of these lives for so long. I always thought the death penalty was right when there was no doubt that somebody was guilty. When this happened to me and my family, I was very supportive of the death penalty, and I still am. They caught him right there where he shot my son. I just don\u2019t understand: 20 years before they killed him. Jennifer Garcia Assistant federal defender in Phoenix who witnessed one execution He was my client. His name was Richard Stokley, and he was executed in December 2012. Often for our clients, they didn\u2019t have people they could depend on, or who fought for them. Once we get on a case, we will stay on it, usually, until the end. The reason why we witnessed was, he asked us to. If he needed reassurance, he\u2019d be able to see one of us smile at him. By the time we got in there and walked into the witness room, I was just so tired, and I was so emotional, and I knew I had to hold it together for him, and I had to make sure he was O.K. through the process. The execution itself was surreal. I cannot even tell you how unbelievable it was to see people deliberately get ready to kill your client. With Mr. Stokley, they couldn\u2019t find a vein. We just sat there for a long time while they started with his hands and worked their way around the body, trying to get a vein. I was trying to maintain my composure because I didn\u2019t want him to look at me and seeing me upset or crying. But it was so hard to watch somebody do that to your client and be powerless. When they pronounced him dead, I think I felt happy that he was no longer being hurt as part of the process. The fact that I knew it was over and there was nothing else worse that was going to happen as part of the execution, that part was a relief. But over all, you feel shellshocked. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m necessarily haunted by it, but I\u2019m very aware of it. If I have a client who asks me to be there, I will be there. Until you are trapped there in that room under such tight control by the prison, and there is no way you can react to that somebody is killing somebody right in front of you, it\u2019s hard to know how you\u2019ll feel. But there is nothing you have already done in your life that will make you go, \u201cOh, this is fine.\u201d Marine Glisovic Reporter for KATV in Little Rock, Ark., and a media witness for Thursday\u2019s execution of Ledell Lee You walk in, and all the seats are to your left. It\u2019s almost set up like a mini-movie theater. We walked up to the front because there were three seats left open for us. There was a black curtain in front of four window panels. They peeled back the curtain, and the inmate is lying down already, and he\u2019s got an IV in each arm. He\u2019s horizontal before us. He stared up the entire time. When they peeled that curtain down, they turned the lights off in our room, the witness room, so the only thing that was lit up was the chamber. As it\u2019s going on, it\u2019s quiet. No one\u2019s saying anything. It was very sterile and clinical. It was like watching somebody be put to sleep, if you will. We had an hour-and-a-half drive home. I got into Little Rock, stopped at the station, got into my car. It wasn\u2019t until I got to my friend\u2019s house that night, it hit me as a person, once I\u2019d gotten out of the journalism mode. I don\u2019t even know how to describe how it hit me. When I got to my friend\u2019s house, she opened the door, and I couldn\u2019t say much at first. I sat down. I want to say I got to her house at about 2 in the morning and I didn\u2019t fall asleep until probably about 5. I just keep talking to her, and just going over it, over and over again. It is probably the shortest yet longest 11 minutes of my life. No matter what anyone says, there\u2019s really nothing to prepare you for what you are about to see. The Rev. Carroll L. Pickett Former prison chaplain who witnessed 95 executions in Texas from April 1980 to August 1995 One time, we had three nights in a row. They\u2019d come in in the morning, and we\u2019d do three executions on consecutive nights. Putting people through that is terrible. I\u2019ve seen a reporter pass out. He was about 6-foot-4. I\u2019m on the inside in the death chamber itself, but I have a mirror, and I could see him just go collapse on the back row. And the major couldn\u2019t take him out because the law says you can\u2019t open the door until it\u2019s over. That\u2019s one of the byproducts that people don\u2019t realize. Family members get sick. Witnesses get sick. Some of my best guards who were with them all day long \u2014 they got sick. The warden changed it to where I would have the same guys all day long, and those are the ones that just eventually had what they called a nervous breakdown, which I just think is horrible \u2014 to see some good-looking captains and lieutenants leave the system because they just can\u2019t do executions. It affects everyone, one way or another. The victim\u2019s family is hurt, and the family of the individual. You\u2019re not just killing a person. You\u2019re killing his whole family. There\u2019s a lot of people involved in this, not just the poor kid lying on a gurney. People don\u2019t realize that you never get over it, unless you\u2019re just cold and calculated. I\u2019ll never forget it. Not a day goes by. Not a day goes by. And I don\u2019t expect it to. If it does, then I didn\u2019t do what I was supposed to do, as a Christian and as a chaplain and as a human being.", "published_date": "2017-04-22T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S."}
