{"text": "Lee Case Klippel and Justin Russell Jee were married April 29 at St. Bartholomew\u2019s Episcopal Church in New York. The Rev. Lynn Sanders, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony. The couple met at Yale, from which they graduated cum laude. The bride, who is 30 and known as Casey, is keeping her name. She is a senior strategy consultant at IBM in Armonk, N.Y. She received a master\u2019s degree in applied mathematics from Columbia and an M.B.A. from N.Y.U. She is the daughter of Lee H. Klippel and Charles H. Klippel of Avon, Conn. The bride\u2019s father is a lawyer for Aetna, the health insurance company, in Hartford. The groom, 29, is in his final year of a combined M.D.-Ph.D. program at N.Y.U., in which he has received a Ph.D. in computational biology. He is the son of Fern S. Jee and James Rodney Jee of Phoenix. The groom\u2019s father is a statistician for Discover in Phoenix. Ms. Klippel and Mr. Jee met in September 2007 at a Connecticut retreat for members of the Yale Glee Club. She was a junior composer who sang soprano for the 80-voice choir, and he was a sophomore piano player who sang bass. \u201cIt was pretty late at night, and we were fiddling around at a piano,\u201d Mr. Jee recalled. \u201cShe was a very popular member of the group, and I found her attractive and was blown away by her friendliness.\u201d He played the piano for her. \u201cBut I must have been pretty forgettable because she didn\u2019t seem too interested in me after that,\u201d he said. They spoke about music for a half-hour, and though Ms. Klippel did not feel initially attracted to Mr. Jee, she said she felt \u201che was a very friendly person, someone you could trust and open up to right away. And he had a genuine love for music, which made it a very enjoyable conversation.\u201d They remained friends for the next year and a half, seeing each other only during rehearsals and events. During her senior year, she had become president of the glee club and had written a chamber opera for three singers, a chorus, a flute, a cello and a piano. \u201cI had seen Justin play some pretty impressive piano for a couple of years and thought he would be the perfect choice,\u201d Ms. Klippel said. She showed him the music \u201cpurely with an eye toward the piano side,\u201d she said, \u201cand he really impressed me with his knowledge and understanding of so many technical aspects of piano, which made my piece so much better.\u201d After working closely with Mr. Jee for several weeks, Ms. Klippel became equally impressed with him as a person. \u201cHe was handsome and funny and very smart,\u201d she said. \u201cI started feeling differently about him.\u201d Unaware that her feelings toward him had changed, Mr. Jee had not suspected that Ms. Klippel was luring him into a first date when she later invited him to a concert on campus. \u201cI made it appear as if it were an entire glee club thing,\u201d Ms. Klippel said, laughing. \u201cBut when we got there, it was just the two of us.\u201d Mr. Jee said he \u201ceventually figured it out,\u201d and they began dating in 2009 in Buenos Aires, where the glee club was giving a concert as part of a tour of South America. \u201cFor reasons that continue to baffle me, I ended up with Casey, so I\u2019m not complaining,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I ended up with her, but I suspect that maybe in the long run, my piano playing wasn\u2019t as forgettable as I had originally thought.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/fashion/weddings/casey-klippel-justin-jee-married.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T09:05:19-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T09:05:19-04:00", "abstract": "The bride and groom met at Yale, where they graduated.", "title": "He Hit the Right Notes"}
