The ruling appeared to end a surreal standoff that arose a day after the death of Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end who was serving a life sentence for a 2013 murder. Jose Baez, a lawyer who had represented Hernandez, called a news conference on Thursday in front of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and accused the state of \u201cillegally\u201d withholding Hernandez\u2019s brain. By donating Hernandez\u2019s brain, his family could be seeking to find if he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma that has been found in about 100 former N.F.L. players. If Hernandez is found to have had the disease, the diagnosis could be used to help apply for money from a class-action settlement between the N.F.L. and former retired players, or in other legal proceedings. Symptoms of C.T.E. include memory loss, impaired judgment, aggression, depression and suicidal tendencies. For now, C.T.E. can only be diagnosed in autopsies. Several former star players, including Junior Seau, Dave Duerson and Andre Waters, committed suicide and were later found to have C.T.E. Although those players were all older than 40, the disease has been found in former athletes in their 20s. The body of Hernandez, 27, was discovered early Wednesday, tied with a bedsheet to the window of his prison cell in Shirley, Mass. Joseph D. Early Jr., the district attorney for Worcester County, released a statement on Thursday that said the cause of death was asphyxia by hanging. Hernandez, who had been acquitted days earlier of a 2012 double murder, had been alone in his cell since 8 p.m. Tuesday, the statement said. His body was discovered about seven hours later, along with a Bible and three handwritten notes. Earlier on Thursday, Baez, who represented Hernandez during the double murder trial, said it was too soon to determine whether his death was a suicide. \u201cWe don\u2019t make that call,\u201d Baez said, \u201cuntil everything is done.\u201d Baez said Hernandez\u2019s family wanted to donate his brain to the C.T.E. Center at Boston University, which has studied the disease for years. The center, which has an extensive brain bank, has produced much of the leading research on the disease and its link to repeated head trauma. \u201cWe had made arrangements for Boston University to come at 10 a.m. to pick up Aaron\u2019s brain,\u201d Baez said, but he added that the medical examiner\u2019s office had decided \u201cat the last minute\u201d to hold it longer. He also threatened to take legal action to force the release of the athlete\u2019s brain. State officials said the brain would be released in due time, and Early\u2019s ruling came several hours later. Hernandez was a rising star with a $40 million contract with the Patriots when, in 2013, he was accused of murdering a friend, Odin Lloyd, after an argument at a nightclub. Hernandez was convicted of that murder and accused of a 2012 double killing. He was acquitted of murder in that second case just last week \u2014 which made his apparent suicide all the more of a shock. Baez said he hoped the study of Hernandez\u2019s brain would help add to the body of knowledge about C.T.E. and shed new light on what exactly happened to him. \u201cWe need to leave no stone unturned, and we need to specifically do everything possible to find out what happened,\u201d Baez said on Thursday. \u201cWhy not? Doesn\u2019t everyone want to know?\u201d", "abstract": "Hernandez\u2019s family may be interested in whether the former N.F.L. player had a degenerative brain disease that can only be diagnosed in autopsies.", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T21:39:49-04:00", "title": "Aaron Hernandez\u2019s Brain Will Be Donated to C.T.E.
