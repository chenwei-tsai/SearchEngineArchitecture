President Trump is skipping this year\u2019s White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner \u2014 the first president to do so since the 1970s. His staff members are boycotting as well.

A red-carpet special leads in at 9, with an uncensored encore broadcast to follow at 11 \u2014 both on Twitter.

RACHEL GETTING MARRIED (2008) on iTunes and Amazon. Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt) may be the one getting married, but this film is mostly about her younger sister, Kym (Anne Hathaway, in an Oscar-nominated performance), \u201ca bottomless repository of guilt, destructiveness and general bad feeling,\u201d A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Furloughed from rehab, Kym arrives at the rambling Connecticut clapboard house of her father (Bill Irwin). Tensions soon boil over. Debra Winger plays the mother, who has never quite come to terms with Kym\u2019s past. And while this film, directed by Jonathan Demme, who died Wednesday, may have its faults, Mr. Scott added, it is \u201cso persuasively forgiving of the flaws of its inhabitants that you can only respond, in like spirit, with love.\u201d THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991) on iTunes and Amazon. Toast it with a Chianti: Jonathan Demme\u2019s scary tour de force, an Oscar winner for best picture and director. JONATHAN DEMME FAVORITES on Sundance Now.
