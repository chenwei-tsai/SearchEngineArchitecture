{"text": "Knicks center Joakim Noah had surgery to repair his right rotator cuff, a procedure that could sideline him until training camp. The team said that Noah had the operation Wednesday at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. It was performed by Dr. David Altchek. The Knicks did not give a timetable for Noah\u2019s recovery, but Coach Jeff Hornacek said late in the season that if Noah had the operation, the recovery time could be five months. Noah had an injury-plagued season that ended early when he was suspended for 20 games by the N.B.A. for violating the league\u2019s antidrug policy. There are 12 games remaining on the penalty that he will have to serve next season if he is healthy. Noah had surgery on his other shoulder last season, limiting him to 29 games in his final season in Chicago before he signed a four-year, $72 million deal with the Knicks. RONDO LIKELY TO SIT If the Chicago Bulls are to extend their postseason, they will almost certainly have to do it without point guard Rajon Rondo. Rondo has a fractured right thumb, and Coach Fred Hoiberg said Thursday that he was a \u201clong shot\u201d to play Game 6 against the Boston Celtics on Friday night. He said he also did not expect Rondo to be available if a Game 7 is necessary. \u201cNothing has changed as of now,\u201d Hoiberg said during a conference call. Hoiberg said Isaiah Canaan would start in Rondo\u2019s place for a second straight game. The Celtics lead the first-round Eastern Conference series, 3-2. Since Rondo injured his hand in Game 2, Boston has won three straight. The Bulls averaged only 93.0 points in those games, compared with 108.5 in the first two.
