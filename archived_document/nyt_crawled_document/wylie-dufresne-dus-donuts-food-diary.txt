{"text": "The deli menu at the Gramercy Food Market, a 24-hour bodega at the corner of East 22nd Street and Second Avenue, offers half a dozen grilled chicken sandwiches named for men of a certain stature: There\u2019s the Al Pacino (with spicy dressing), the Larry King (with Russian dressing) and the John Lennon (with chipotle sauce). Each comes with a free bag of Lay\u2019s and a Pepsi. But Wylie Dufresne doesn\u2019t do lunch here. Only breakfast. And only before 11 a.m. (to avoid the $1 late-breakfast fee). And so frequently that the guy behind the counter knows his order: one egg on a roll ($2). Except Dufresne takes two eggs (for an extra 50 cents). \u201cIt\u2019s a classic New York egg-and-cheese \u2014 the best,\u201d says the chef, who lives nearby. \u201cThere are so many bad ones. It\u2019s so satisfying when it\u2019s done right.\u201d Dufresne takes the foil-wrapped sandwich with him down 23rd Street, walking at a rapid clip. He\u2019s dressed more like a hiker than a world-renowned chef revered for artfully plated, scientifically forward food, including delicacies like fried mayonnaise and savory everything-bagel ice cream. The iconic dishes he served at his now-shuttered restaurant WD-50 influenced an entire generation of molecular gastronomists. But on this day, he\u2019s preparing for the opening of Du\u2019s Donuts & Coffee, a much more casual joint situated at the William Vale Hotel in Williamsburg. (The space is now open.) \u201cMy friend says I look like I\u2019m \u2018forever camping,\u2019\u201d he admits, referring to the waterproof backpack usually strapped across his chest, and his dry-wick North Face shorts crammed with mini flashlights and a pocketknife. As for the hot breakfast sandwich in his hand, he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat it yet. It\u2019s not ready.\u201d Not ready? \u201cThe cheese hasn\u2019t melted yet. It\u2019s still steaming.\u201d Also, he needs coffee \u2014 which he didn\u2019t order at the deli because, he says, \u201cI won\u2019t drink bad coffee.\u201d And he is constantly on the hunt for good coffee. Since the closing of his restaurant Alder two years ago, Dufresne has roamed Manhattan in search of two \u201cmeaningful coffee experiences\u201d a day. He pulls a binder clip, fat with punch cards, out of one of his many pockets to prove it. He recounts stories of buying two coffees and only receiving one punch, being called \u201cWilly\u201d by baristas \u2014 and sometimes using his eldest daughter\u2019s name, Sawyer, only to see it scrawled onto his cup as Soyer. \u201cGuess they\u2019ve never heard of Tom?\u201d Dufresne laughs. He fans out his punch cards like a poker player proud of his hand: Everyman. Birch. Ground Support. Toby\u2019s Estate. \u201cAh, they owe me a free one\u2026\u201d he says, pleased. Turns out, so does Brooklyn Roasting Company, where he ends up this morning. Standing in line, corralled by velvet ropes, he whips out his phone and started the timer. \u201cI always time it,\u201d he says. (He refuses to wait for longer than eight minutes.) He picks up his short latte (no sugar, no lid). It\u2019s a warm spring day, but even in the dead of winter, Dufresne\u2019s latte is iced \u2014 with the proper milk-to-espresso ratio only his most regular baristas get right. Purists might balk at putting milk in coffee, Dufresne says, \u201cbut for me, it\u2019s all about coffee and milk. They\u2019re friends,\u201d he explains. \u201cLike bread and butter. Wine and cheese.\u201d Speaking of, 15 minutes after leaving the bodega, his cheese is ready. Dufresne unwraps the sandwich to reveal a lightly toasted Kaiser roll, eggs scrambled, a slice of American oozing in its orange-hued glory. Though Du\u2019s is strictly doughnuts (10 highly technical flavors, including peanut butter yuzu as well as Creamsicle), eventually he plans to add an egg-and-cheese of his own \u2014 on an onion Kaiser. He really likes onion Kaisers. In fact, Dufresne has a lot of likes (and dislikes). Some more mass-market than you might expect from a James Beard Award-winning chef just back from the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants ceremonies in Melbourne. He likes Popeye\u2019s fried chicken so much he served it at his wedding. He likes the occasional McDonalds burger (no ketchup, no pickles, no sauce). He really likes the NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, enough to DVR it. And despite the ostensible competition, he deems Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 chocolate glazed \u201cperfect.\u201d Unlike most of America, though, he prefers to finish his coffee while seated rather than taking it to go. \u201cI don\u2019t like holding anything,\u201d he explains. (Umbrellas, in Wylie\u2019s world, are especially ridiculous.) \u201cScrubbies,\u201d however, are essential. He makes a beeline for Home Depot, which he navigates with the speed and expertise of a star employee, and goes directly to the Scotch-Brite Extreme Scrubs. \u201cSo much better than Scrub Daddy,\u201d he says. \u201cShark Tank\u2019s biggest seller ever!\u201d Errands done, Dufresne has one last stop before it\u2019s time to test the doughnuts at Du\u2019s: Pret a Manger. He eats Pret for lunch pretty much every day. The chain has 50 locations in Manhattan, and \u201cI\u2019ve got four in my rotation,\u201d Dufresne says. But only one order: the balsamic chicken and avocado sandwich, a cucumber seltzer and a brownie bite. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic.\u201d As good as Maile\u2019s, he says, referring to his wife, who is the editor in chief of Food Network magazine. He first tried Pret when Sawyer was a toddler. It was easy. She liked chicken. On his day off, they\u2019d sit on a rock in Union Square, near where he grew up, and share a sandwich. \u201cI remembered thinking, \u2018That\u2019s tasty.\u2019\u201d Years later, without WD-50 to feed him, and in a moment of nostalgia, he rediscovered Pret\u2019s chicken sandwich. \u201cNext thing I knew,\u201d he says, \u201cI was eating it four times a week.\u201d Soon, Dufresne started bringing his laptop, taking phone calls; Pret became his de facto office. \u201cSetting up investor meetings, my business partner once asked, in all seriousness: \u2018Which Pret do you want to meet at?\u2019\u201d he recalls, laughing. \u201cThis woman was giving us $75,000. I picked the Nomad instead.\u201d Only twice has his Pret order strayed \u2014 to the chicken soup, and only because he had a cold. He has the utmost praise for the prepackaged sandwich. \u201cIt\u2019s smartly engineered,\u201d he says, explaining that the grilled chicken, not the mesclun, is dressed in the balsamic vinaigrette and sits between the dry lettuce and the avocado, so the bread doesn\u2019t \u201csog out.\u201d He takes it outside to Sawyer\u2019s rock and eats every bite except the brownie bite. He likes to save it for later, for his second coffee experience. Meanwhile, Dufresne can\u2019t help but laugh about his steadfast devotion to eating Pret\u2019s chicken sandwich. \u201cWe\u2019re all creatures of habit,\u201d he offers. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not a candy bar.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/t-magazine/wylie-dufresne-dus-donuts-food-diary.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "T Magazine", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T05:50:46-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T05:50:46-04:00", "abstract": "Despite being known for inventive molecular gastronomy, Wylie Dufresne buys sandwiches from a bodega \u2014 and Pret a Manger \u2014 nearly every day.", "title": "One Award-Winning Chef \u2014 and His Surprisingly Cheap Eating Habits"}
