{"text": "How do interior designers make the choices they do? That\u2019s the question I ask every time I step into an artfully decorated room or look through shelter magazines in admiration. Why were those framed drawings arranged above that Art Deco table? Why were the floorboards in the loft apartment stained black? Why, out of thousands of sofas, go with a boxy seven-footer upholstered in deep green velvet? I never have a clue. Despite my love for interior design and architecture, I don\u2019t understand space and composition, and lack the ability to put a room together with confidence. Decisions are made arbitrarily, then regretted. One of my favorite design books is \u201cJacques Grange: Interiors\u201d by Pierre Passebon, which showcases the work of the renowned French decorator. Mr. Grange\u2019s layered, bohemian rooms for clients like Yves Saint Laurent, filled with rare and beautiful objects, art and lots of chairs, are an ideal for me, and I must have studied the images a thousand times. But if the book is a kind of bible, it\u2019s an inscrutable one, composed in a visual language I can\u2019t translate. What I often wonder about decorators like Mr. Grange is whether they are following an established set of rules \u2014 about space, color, proportion, materials, and so on \u2014 and experimenting within a framework of dos and don\u2019ts. If there are rules, then an amateur like me can learn them. Or is decorating a series of subjective decisions made by people with innate good taste \u2014 a make-it-up-as-you-go profession? In which case, I will never master it. To help me better understand, I called Bennett Leifer, a young, New York-based designer whose work has been featured in Elle D\u00e9cor and House Beautiful. Although Mr. Leifer, 35, didn\u2019t formally study design, he did serve a long apprenticeship in the field, working for Ralph Lauren in the brand\u2019s store development, for the architect Robert A.M. Stern and for Juan Pablo Molyneux, the high-end residential decorator. When he felt he was \u201ccooked enough,\u201d Mr. Leifer said, he started his own interiors firm, in 2013. \u201cFor me, what I do is so emotional,\u201d Mr. Leifer explained. \u201cThe right way to do things is what sets up a backdrop for how a client is going to live. It\u2019s not, for me, about color theory.\u201d But, he added, \u201cThere are rules you learn along the way. I learned a lot about proportions and dimensions.\u201d In talking with Mr. Leifer, I realized what I really wanted was to see a room through a designer\u2019s eyes. I wanted him to break down each aesthetic decision, and explain why he\u2019d made it. Mr. Leifer was game, and we decided to deconstruct the living room of his Manhattan apartment, which was sufficiently stylish to be featured in Architectural Digest. I also asked him to view a space unfamiliar to him \u2014 the living room of my apartment in Brooklyn Heights, which is not exactly A.D. worthy. Indeed, if there were decorating rules, certainly I\u2019d broken a few. Listening to Mr. Leifer explain his work and critique mine turned out to be the revelation I\u2019d hoped for. Sometimes he taught me a rule I didn\u2019t know, sometimes he operated on instinct, but the reasons were always clear and logical. Surprisingly, so many of Mr. Leifer\u2019s decisions were not guided by beauty but common sense and functionality. For me, it was interior design demystified.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/style/what-designers-know-that-you-dont.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Style", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T15:26:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T15:26:03-04:00", "abstract": "Could I learn anything important from having a designer deconstruct my space?
