{"text": "Expect to see the director Anne Kauffman\u2019s name often at New York Theater Workshop this fall. The Off Broadway company\u2019s 2017-18 season, which includes five productions, will open with a play and a musical, both directed by Ms. Kauffman, whose recent credits include \u201cA Life\u201d and \u201cMarjorie Prime.\u201d Amy Herzog\u2019s play \u201cMary Jane,\u201d about a single mother caring for a sick child amid a rain-drenched summer in New York, reunites her with Ms. Kauffman after their critically successful run of Ms. Herzog\u2019s \u201cBelleville,\u201d which ran at New York Theater Workshop in 2013. Next, Ms. Kauffman is set to direct \u201cHundred Days,\u201d a musical by the married duo the Bengsons that had its premiere at the Under the Radar Festival at the Public Theater this year. Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times that Shaun and Abigail Bengson \u201coffer luminous hope that a new generation of talent in American theater is taking up Stephen Sondheim\u2019s mantle of exquisite ambivalence.\u201d Later in the season, Rachel Chavkin \u2014 who just received a Tony Award nomination for \u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812\u201d and directed the musical \u201cHadestown\u201d at New York Theater Workshop \u2014 will direct \u201cLight Shining in Buckinghamshire,\u201d a drama by the British playwright Caryl Churchill (\u201cEscaped Alone\u201d).
