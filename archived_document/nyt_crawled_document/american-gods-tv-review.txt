{"text": "At one of the many tense moments in \u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d a character named Shadow Moon pleads with his employer, Mr. Wednesday, saying, more or less: \u201cI don\u2019t give a fig if they don\u2019t have a figging clue. I want one. Give me a figging clue.\u201d This happens early in Episode 2, by which time viewers might want one, too. Like the much-loved Neil Gaiman novel from 2001 on which it\u2019s based, \u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d which starts Sunday on Starz, is a melting pot of themes, styles and influences. There\u2019s an American-roots thing going on, with characters road-tripping across the heartland and Bob Dylan, the Band and Creedence Clearwater Revival on the soundtrack \u2014 like a much more serious \u201cSupernatural,\u201d annotated by Greil Marcus. There\u2019s a fortuitously timely displacement theme, in which the presence in America of some of the gods of the title \u2014 human avatars of deities from Norse, African, Slavic, Indian and other traditions \u2014 appears to be tied to the experiences of immigrants, explorers or slaves from those regions. But primarily, \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d fits into the television category of speculative fiction of the hard-edge, violent variety. The occasional billows and streams of blood are reminiscent of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cTrue Blood,\u201d though the show doesn\u2019t share the linear storytelling style of those HBO fantasies. It belongs instead with shows that favor fractured, withholding narratives, arresting visuals (whether they serve the story or not) and an overall sense of dread. Recent comparisons, none perfect, include \u201cOutcast\u201d on Cinemax, \u201cEmerald City\u201d on NBC and \u201cPreacher\u201d on AMC. Also NBC\u2019s canceled \u201cHannibal,\u201d which makes sense \u2014 its creator, Bryan Fuller, developed \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d along with Michael Green. And in terms of style, Mr. Fuller has outdone himself on \u201cGods.\u201d It\u2019s consistently eye-catching, sometimes in burnished, picturesque ways and sometimes disorienting, grotesque ways. (Severed limbs are a recurring motif.) But he and Mr. Green have also pushed the envelope in terms of cryptic and leisurely storytelling. Through the four episodes (of eight) available for review, viewers who haven\u2019t read Mr. Gaiman\u2019s book will have only the faintest idea of where the plot is headed. They\u2019ll know that Shadow (Ricky Whittle), just released from prison, hits the road with Mr. Wednesday (a droll Ian McShane) on a mission of unspecified aim but great importance that takes the two toward Chicago. They won\u2019t know how this connects with other sequences involving a neon-suited fancy man on a slave ship, a flame-eyed gay genie in modern-day New York or a woman who picks up men for a uniquely predatory form of sex. Those who have read the novel, or read about the novel, can assume (spoiler alert) that a battle looms that will pit Shadow, Mr. Wednesday and the other old-school gods against a crew of new gods representing the worst aspects of modern American culture. Knowing this might be crucial for making it through the starts and stops and sideways jumps of the early episodes. If you\u2019re willing to wait for the story to take shape, there are compensations. The action hums along, even if you can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s going, and there\u2019s a welcome edge of humor (not abundant in this genre), especially in the performances of Mr. McShane and Pablo Schreiber as a tall Irishman who calls himself a leprechaun. Gillian Anderson shows up, delightfully, as one of the new gods, who takes the form of Lucy Ricardo in \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d and speaks to Shadow from a display of flat-screen TVs. The elusive narrative threads of \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d make a kind of structural sense: Shadow, plunged without warning into the gods\u2019 realm, is bewildered by everything he sees, and we\u2019re experiencing his bewilderment. Whether you take to the show will depend on whether you\u2019re as patient as Shadow when it comes to getting a clue.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/television/american-gods-tv-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T14:58:15-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T14:58:15-04:00", "abstract": "The new series, on Starz, is based on a 2001 novel from Neil Gaiman and finds a range of deities in a bloody and fractured narrative.", "title": "Review: \u2018American Gods\u2019 Works in Mysterious Ways"}
