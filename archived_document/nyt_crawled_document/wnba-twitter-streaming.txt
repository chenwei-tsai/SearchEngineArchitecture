{"text": "A few months ago, W.N.B.A. President Lisa Borders reached out to Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd, who had injured her ankle while playing in China. Borders wanted to see how Loyd was recovering. During their conversation, Borders also asked Loyd for any ideas on how to broaden the game and help expand the league\u2019s reach. Loyd recommended that the W.N.B.A. stream its games on Twitter, as other leagues have done. The idea struck a chord with Borders. On Monday night, the W.N.B.A. became the first women\u2019s professional sports league to sign a rights deal with Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to calling her and telling her that you made a suggestion, I heard it, we listened and we now have a deal with Twitter,\u201d Borders said on Monday afternoon. The announcement of the three-year deal coincided with Twitter\u2019s presentation to advertising buyers on Monday night at Digital Content NewFronts, an industry conference in New York. Twitter will stream 20 regular-season games in each of the next three seasons, starting with the game between the Dallas Wings and the Phoenix Mercury on May 14. The games are exclusive to Twitter and are not simulcasts of local or national television games. Twitter is paying the W.N.B.A. guaranteed money to stream the games, but the league would not release the financial details. The W.N.B.A. also has a national television deal with ESPN that runs through 2022 and includes 16 games per season and coverage of the playoffs, the draft and the All-Star Game. \u201cWe are excited to help extend the reach of women\u2019s sports around the world by collaborating further with the N.B.A. to be the home of weekly live W.N.B.A. games for the next three seasons,\u201d Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a news release. \u201cThe growing women\u2019s basketball fan base will be able to turn to Twitter to watch free games side by side with the real-time conversation.\u201d This is the latest sports deal for Twitter, which streams weekly out-of-market Major League Baseball and N.H.L. games, some PGA Tour events and other minor events. Twitter also streamed the N.F.L.\u2019s \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d games last season, but Amazon outbid Twitter for this season\u2019s package. Amazon will air the 10 Thursday night games during the 2017 season on its Amazon Prime service, for which customers pay $99 per year. The N.F.L. deal is Amazon\u2019s first foray into sports rights. Facebook also recently struck deals to stream live sporting events. During the 2016-17 season, the N.B.A.\u2019s Development League games were streamed on Facebook Live. In March, Facebook and Major League Soccer announced that at least 22 games in the 2017 season would be available on Facebook. \u201cSports are inherently social, with the power to build and connect communities around the world,\u201d Dan Reed, Facebook\u2019s head of global sports partnerships, said in a statement. \u201cThis aligns closely with our mission, and we feel Facebook is a natural home for sports content, including live games. Early experiments with these events on Facebook have delivered great results for fans, broadcasters and rights holders.\u201d For now, major broadcasters like ABC/ESPN, NBC, CBS and Fox Sports dominate the market for sports rights and pay hundreds of millions of dollars to televise games. Major internet companies like Facebook and Amazon have the financial resources to compete with traditional broadcasters, although they have not invested much money in sports rights deals so far. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet how to make these profitable in their own right, but because there\u2019s a belief that it can be value-enhancing, I think you\u2019re just going to see more deals of this nature so long as the leagues are willing to sell those rights separately,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s worth putting some money into because they may want to go bigger.\u201d Still, deals with internet and social media companies are a way for smaller leagues like the W.N.B.A. to add revenue and experiment with new ways to show their games. In 2016, the W.N.B.A. streamed the ring ceremony for the Minnesota Lynx on Facebook. \u201cIf folks can\u2019t be physically in a market inside an arena, then we look for them to use tools like Twitter to enjoy the games,\u201d Borders said. \u201cFolks have their choice of when they want to see games and how they want to see games. This is a real nod to the future, on recognizing that some of our fans are consuming sports in very different ways.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/sports/basketball/wnba-twitter-streaming.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T20:20:29-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T20:20:29-04:00", "abstract": "The 20-game agreement makes the basketball league the first women\u2019s professional sports group to sign a rights deal with the social media service.", "title": "Twitter Signs a Deal to Stream Regular-Season W.N.B.A. Games"}
