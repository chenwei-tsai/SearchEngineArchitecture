{"text": "After two episodes, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d has shown that it excels at placing the horrific, the surreal and the achingly mundane side-by-side. In one image, four handmaids speak about the weather as dead bodies are strung up behind them, the only acknowledgment of their supposed crimes being the symbols on the bags that cloak their face. It\u2019s a masterly composition, one which succeeds by the tensions of its juxtapositions. From the very beginning, it\u2019s clear that this sort of garish imagery is meant to provoke us into wondering how such extremes are allowed to flourish. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d may be grotesque, but it\u2019s also honest about the cost of survival and the cruel complicity of women like Serena Joy who fiercely hold onto what limited power they have at the expense of others\u2019 subjugation. Episode 2 opens as Offred lies on her back, methodically free-associating her thoughts with the blue color in the ceiling mural overhead. . Her face is placid. Her body stiff but rocking as Fred rapes her and Serena Joy clenches her arms. The delicate beauty of the room with its tinkling crystal chandelier, decorative moldings and four-poster bed only heightens the horror of what\u2019s occurring. But this episode isn\u2019t only interested in detailing the profound horror of Gilead. It also explores to a deeper degree the caste system, using Janine\u2019s pregnancy as the vehicle for this commentary. Offred accompanies several other handmaids to the birthing ceremony of Janine and Naomi (Ever Carradine), the Commander\u2019s wife Janine acts as a surrogate for. Offred finds herself in a mansion full of sunlight and blinding white d\u00e9cor. The Commander\u2019s wives, including Serena Joy, attend to Naomi as she mimics the painful contractions that Janine is actually experiencing upstairs, surrounded by Aunt Lydia and a horde of handmaids. When Offred crouches by Janine\u2019s side, she starts to remember her own pregnancy. In the flashbacks, Offred gives birth to a baby girl named Hannah, which on another series wouldn\u2019t be particularly notable. But here it means everything \u2014 this is a world in which fertility rates are dropping and many children are born with defects. It\u2019s only after Offred gives birth that things start to feel amiss. The hospital is deathly quiet. There are no crying babies. No pacing parents. Save for Offred, Luke, Hannah and the nurses tending to them, the maternity ward seems empty. When Offred asks one of the nurses where the babies are, she\u2019s told: \u201cWe had a difficult night. Two went to the intensive care unit. The others are with God.\u201d Later that evening, Offred awakes to find Hannah missing. When Luke doesn\u2019t have her and an alarm sounds, she is seized with panic. She encounters a stabbed nurse resting in a pool of her own blood followed by a young woman who seems unhinged in a way that reminds me of Janine. This strange woman cradles Hannah, convinced that she\u2019s her daughter. With the help of Luke and some police officers, Hannah is returned to Offred. In this dystopia, there is a currency to fertility. The Commanders\u2019 wives may resent the handmaids, referring to them as \u201cwhores\u201d or treating them with chilly disdain. But handmaids are needed. Even one as troubled as Janine. This is the only time Aunt Lydia has shown Janine anything close to kindness. The ceremony becomes even more surreal as Janine\u2019s labor continues. In an elaborate chair, Janine sits in front giving birth while Naomi is in the elevated seat behind her. Naomi continues her farcical approximation of labor. When Janine finally gives birth, they all hold their breath. The room grows still. Will the baby be healthy or have birth defects? That the baby girl is born healthy is little comfort to Janine since she doesn\u2019t get to hold her or name her. It\u2019s Naomi who gets that distinction. Janine is only kept around to breast-feed her daughter. But soon this baby will be only a memory to Janine, and she will have another posting. This is all a clever mirror for Offred\u2019s yearnings to reconnect with Hannah. This episode demonstrates how good the series is so far at drawing out suspense. Offred is wrestling with several problems she\u2019s not sure how to handle. The first: Should she trust Ofglen? Her camaraderie is welcome, but it also feels worryingly forced at times. Ofglen eagerly tries to help by garnering information for Offred and though she isn\u2019t able to find anything out, her brazenness is worrying. Either Ofglen is, in fact, working for the resistance, or she\u2019s trying to put Offred in a terrible situation. Offred finds the truth when at the very end of the episode it isn\u2019t Ofglen who greets her but an entirely new handmaid. Then there\u2019s her Commander, Fred, who has extended an after-hours invitation to his room through Nick, his driver. Like so many things in Gilead, Fred\u2019s overture could be either an act of kindness or the first step in a deception meant to entrap. As Offred descends the stairs she muses about how all this resembles a horror film, the lone girl walking deeper into a darkness that hides her potentially brutal fate. Beyond the door of Fred\u2019s office, however, where even Serena Joy isn\u2019t allowed to go, isn\u2019t condemnation. Fred simply wants to play Scrabble with her. He beats her by just three points, and when they shake hands at the end after setting up a date for another game, it seems that this is the first time they have truly seen the humanity in each other. This surprising encounter makes me wonder: What else happens late at night behind the closed doors of Gilead? Other Gossip: \u2022 Given how important the caste system is in Gilead, I am curious about the racial dynamics for black handmaids. Are there black Commanders? Are black handmaids considered less desirable? \u2022 The voice-over still feels heavy-handed, but it has improved by providing more biting commentary. \u2022 The music choices (the song from the end of \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d for example) feel ill-suited for the mood the show is trying to invoke. \u2022 Given that Offred calls attention to the smell of real coffee, I wonder what handmaids are given to eat. \u2022 In the premiere as well as this episode, the hanged bodies of supposed criminals illuminate what counts as a crime in Gilead. So far, based on the symbolic bags that hide the faces of the condemned, that seems to include being gay, Jewish and a doctor.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/television/the-handmaids-tale-recap-birth.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T13:40:25-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T13:40:25-04:00", "abstract": "Offred\u2019s predicament grows more surreal.", "title": "\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u2019 Season 1, Episode 2: Something Primal"}
