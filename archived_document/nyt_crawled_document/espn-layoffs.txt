ESPN is by far the biggest and most powerful entity in sports broadcasting, and it also may feel the sting more as viewers turn away from traditional ways of consuming live sports. The network has paid vast sums for the broadcast rights to many major sporting events, but the revenue derived from cable subscriptions is declining. More than 10 million subscribers have been lost over the past several years. \u201cESPN was wrapped in Teflon for many years, but big payouts for rights fees plus significant losses in their subscriber base were like punches to the gut and head, and now the company is trying to make sure they are strong enough to fight in the future,\u201d said James Andrew Miller, who wrote a book on ESPN and has contributed to The New York Times. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided one way to do this is to change their approach to content and rely more heavily on digital; this has enabled them to let go of a big chunk of their talent base.\u201d In October 2015, ESPN laid off about 300 people, most of whom were not on camera. \u201cDynamic change demands and increased focus on versatility and value, and as a result, we have been engaged in the challenging process of determining the talent \u2014 anchors, analysts, reporters, writers and those who handle play-by-play \u2014 necessary to meet those demands,\u201d ESPN\u2019s president, John Skipper, said in a statement to employees on Wednesday. Here are some of the names made public so far (we will update this list as more names are announced): N.F.L. reporter Ed Werder College basketball reporter Dana O\u2019Neil Hockey reporter Joe McDonald Hockey columnist Scott Burnside", "created_date": "2017-04-26T10:53:53-04:00", "section": "Sports", "abstract": "Longtime television analyst Ed Werder is among the many personalities to be laid off.", "item_type": "Article"}
