Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen advanced to the runoff of France\u2019s presidential elections on May 7. The result was a rebuke of France\u2019s traditional mainstream parties, which quickly rallied behind Mr. Macron. Ms. Le Pen, a far-right firebrand, said the outcome was \u201cthat of a people who are raising up their heads.\u201d Mr. Macron, who has never held elected office, said he wanted to be the \u201cpresident of patriots, to face the threat of nationalists.\u201d Our journalists weighed in with analysis of the results. Among them is our Berlin bureau chief who writes that this outcome may dent the far right\u2019s rise in Europe. Check back for more coverage throughout the day. _____ \u2022 Afghanistan declared a national day of mourning after the Taliban killed scores in the deadliest attack on an Afghan military base in the country\u2019s 16-year war. The realization that even the country\u2019s most guarded places are not safe only compounded the trauma and anxiety over what could come next. Meanwhile, in Denmark, the case of Zarmena Waziri, above, a 70-year-old Afghan woman with dementia, has captured headlines as the authorities have ordered her to leave her family and return to her native country. _____ \u2022 In Tunisia, the Truth and Dignity Commission, which seeks accountability over the country\u2019s past horrors, has opened a Pandora\u2019s box of emotions. \u201cI am not denouncing people but the system,\u201d one victim said. Even former President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was said to have watched the proceedings from exile in Saudi Arabia. _____ \u2022 The International Monetary Fund is reluctant to commit new loans to a nearly bankrupt Greece, reflecting a widely held view among its officials (and in the White House) that the fund had overextended itself. Athens faces a 7 billion euro debt repayment in July, which it may not be able to meet if the I.M.F. and Europe cannot reach a new bailout agreement. _____ \u2022 An old paper trail offers new evidence of Turkish complicity in the Armenian genocide, widely acknowledged as the first of the 20th century. A historian has unearthed what he calls \u201cthe smoking gun\u201d: an original telegram from post-World War I trials that convicted the planners. Above, a site where Armenians were said to have been killed. Separately, \u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant,\u201d a new film backed by Turkish investors, has been pilloried by critics for whitewashing Turkish actions in the genocide. _____ \u2022 In his quest to build Uber into the world\u2019s dominant ride-hailing entity, Travis Kalanick, the company\u2019s hard-driving chief, has at times brought the business, and himself, to the precipice. \u2022 Fox News\u2019s decision to cut ties with its biggest star, Bill O\u2019Reilly, reflects the rising influence of a new generation at 21st Century Fox: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sons, James and Lachlan. \u2022 Not so Dickensian anymore: For the first time since the Industrial Revolution, Britain went a day without burning coal for power, a milestone that heartened climate activists. \u2022  Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 An American member of the European monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine was killed and two other people were injured when their vehicle drove over a land mine. [Reuters] \u2022 Kuki Gallmann, one of Kenya\u2019s most renowned conservationists, was shot by armed pastoralists, the latest sign of chaos ripping through a country facing a drought. [The New York Times] \u2022 North Korea appears to have resumed work at its nuclear test site after a perplexing series of volleyball matches were held there. [The New York Times] \u2022 Joachim Gauck, the former president of Germany, will be the first statesman from the country to attend Israel\u2019s official ceremony honoring the end of Holocaust Remembrance Day today. [The New York Times] \u2022 Peggy Whitson, the first woman to command the International Space Station, is on the verge of setting a U.S. record for most accumulated time in space: 534 days. [Associated Press] \u2022 There\u2019s no one rule for staying married, but being able to embrace change sure helps. \u2022 Impactful activities may be just that: Running and jumping can improve bone health. But brisk walks and other light, whole-body vibration exercises help, too. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Make a better chicken salad. No, wait: Make the best. \u2022 Lionel Messi scored in the last minute of a nail-biter el Cl\u00e1sico to give Barcelona a 3-2 win over Real Madrid. \u2022 After some rest and relaxation in French Polynesia, Barack Obama returns to Chicago today for his first public event as a former president. \u2022 Smoking a cigarette was a criminal act that could earn 20 lashes when the Islamic State ruled northern Iraq. Now it\u2019s an (unhealthy) sign of freedom. \u2022 The Times Magazine profiled six artists reshaping their crafts. Among them is Studio Swine, a London-based (but globe-trotting) design duo driven by an obsession with sustainability. \u2022 And a two-century-old statue of a naked George Washington is coming from Italy to the United States for the first time. Take a moment to appreciate the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched aboard the shuttle Discovery on this day in 1990. For 27 years, it has sent us images of far-distant celestial wonders, captured in stunning detail. The $1.5 billion telescope is the length of a school bus and orbits the Earth at about 17,000 miles an hour. It\u2019s expected to keep working until at least 2020. The Hubble\u2019s first pictures lacked clarity because of major flaws with the telescope\u2019s mirror, necessitating a repair trip. All in all, the telescope has required five major repairs, replacements or upgrades, the last of which was in 2009. The reward? Gorgeous photographs, like the one above of the so-called Pillars of Creation, part of the Eagle Nebula nearly 7,000 light years from Earth. And this recent close-up of Jupiter, 415 million miles away. Its successor, NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to launch in 2018. This telescope, equipped with a much bigger mirror, is designed to see deeper into space than the Hubble, and may solve mysteries about how the first stars and galaxies were created.
