If I had to dream up a perfect pairing for a collaborative crossword, it would be the classical pianist Emanuel Ax and music lover Mr. Wilber. And what a way to celebrate one\u2019s 50th contribution to The New York Times Crossword! Today we have another in the series of celebrity-constructed puzzles that are running as part of the 75th anniversary of The New York Times Crossword celebration. And, if you thought that the black squares in the middle of the grid looked like a musical NOTE, you would be correct. Because what else would it be? Mr. Ax and Mr. Wilber offer us a \u201cword that can go at the end of another word\u201d theme, and the set includes two Across and two Down entries. Not only do the theme entries cross, which is an elegant touch, but all four of the theme entries are lively and interesting. For example, at 20A, we have the clue \u201cClassic song with the lyric \u2018Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?\u2019\u201d and the answer is \u201cMONSTER MASH.\u201d The revealer, at 52 Down, is clued as \u201cWord that can follow the ends of 20- and 54-Across and 4- and 26-Down.\u201d The answer is NOTE, and if you add that to the end of MASH, you wind up with a MASH NOTE. Similarly, you can go out on a HIGH NOTE if you add NOTE to the end of RUNNER\u2019S HIGH at 26D. That\u2019s two theme entries; can you sing \u2014 sorry, find \u2014 the other ones? \u25a0 23A: \u201cGold in a pond?\u201d is not referring to buried treasure. It refers to the goldfish, or KOI, who swim there. \u25a0 32A: I thought this might be part of the theme as I was solving, but it\u2019s nice bonus music-related material even though it is not. \u201cWhat the keys are to a pianist?\u201d is the PLAY AREA, because that is the area in which a pianist plays. \u25a0 35A: \u201cTrattoria order?\u201d is not necessarily about the food on your plate. It could be about how bossy your server is, and that\u2019s why the answer is \u201cEat!\u201d or MANGIA. \u25a0 10D: Not a math question. Today, \u201cWhat a radius is part of\u201d is ARM, because the radius is a bone in the ARM. Nicely done, Mr. Ax. You might have an alternative career in puzzles, should the music thing not work out. And happy 50th New York Times puzzle, Mr. Wilber. Your thoughts?", "item_type": "Article"}
