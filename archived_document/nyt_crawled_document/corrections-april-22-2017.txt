The company owns casinos and restaurant chains, not the Ultimate Fighting Championship. (A company also named Fertitta Entertainment owns the UFC.) BUSINESS DAY An article last Saturday about financial aid appeals for college students misstated at one point, in some editions, the surname of the chief executive of the Independent Educational Consultants Association. He is Mark Sklarow, not Skarlow. ARTS & LEISURE An article on Page 24 this weekend about the exhibition \u201cCalder/Miro: Constellations,\u201d using information from Acquavella Galleries, misstates the number of paintings by Miro in the show. It is 22, not 23. (One painting that was to have been on loan to Acquavella was withdrawn and the gallery substituted a print; The Times discovered the change after the section had gone to press.) T: CULTURE An article on Page 114 this weekend about the quirky, unconventional work of the French artist Sophie Calle, which blurs the distinction between art and life, misidentifies the medium in which her \u201cThe Birthday Ceremony\u201d series and her \u201cVoir la mer\u201d series were made. \u201cThe Birthday Ceremony\u201d is comprised of sculptures, not photographs, and \u201cVoir la mer\u201d is comprised of digital films, not photographs. The article also omits part of the title of a Calle show. It is \u201cMy Mother, My Cat, My Father, in that order\u201d \u2014 not merely \u201cMy Mother, My Cat, My Father.\u201d In addition, the article misstates the year a show by Calle will open at the Muse\u00e9 de la Chasse et de la Nature. It will be shown starting in October 2017, not 2018. The article also misstates part of the name of the organization curating Calle\u2019s upcoming show \u201cSophie Calle: Missing.\u201d It is Ars Citizen, not Arts Citizen. And, finally, the article refers incorrectly to Calle\u2019s connection to a burial plot at Green-Wood cemetery in Brooklyn. She was offered the plot as part of a site-specific project she is making there; she has not bought a burial plot there. OBITUARIES An obituary on April 1 about the lawyer and former transportation secretary William T. Coleman erroneously attributed a distinction to him. He was one of first black members of the Harvard Law Review, not the first. (Charles Hamilton Houston had served on the board in the early 20th century.) The obituary also misstated the year Mr. Coleman graduated from Harvard Law School. It was 1946, not 1947. In addition, the obituary referred imprecisely to Mr. Coleman\u2019s military service in World War II. He joined the Army Air Forces \u2014 not the Army Air Corps, which was a component of the Army Air Forces.
