{"text": "HER BACK PAGES: You can tell a lot about a book from its index. Consider Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight,\u201d reviewed by Paul Krugman on Page 12 and new to the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1. On its face, the book \u2014 subtitled \u201cThe Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class\u201d \u2014 is all about economic issues, and the index is correspondingly flecked with terms like \u201clayoffs\u201d (one citation), \u201cmanufacturing decline\u201d (one citation) and \u201crent assistance\u201d (two citations). But really these are just the parsley on the meatloaf. Flip through the back pages and it\u2019s clear that Warren, the hard-punching Massachusetts senator, has a more personal fight in mind: The index listing for \u201cTrump, Donald\u201d is divided into dozens of subcategories beginning with \u201cbait-and-switch and\u201d (two citations), then moving on to \u201cbigotry and\u201d (four citations), \u201ccorporate influences on\u201d (five citations) and \u201ctrickle-down and\u201d (seven citations). There are also listings for \u201ctax returns and,\u201d \u201c\u2018nasty woman\u2019 comment of\u201d and \u2014 my favorite \u2014 \u201ctweetstorms vs.,\u201d which directs readers to a four-page recap of Warren\u2019s social media battle with Trump during the presidential race. \u201cI tweeted about how he cheated hardworking people who had built his hotels and golf courses,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI mentioned his bullying, his attacks on women, his racism, his obvious narcissism. And in that first tweetstorm, I did my best to sound the alarm: This guy is dangerous, and he could end up as president of the United States.\u201d THE O\u2019REILLY FACTOR: In the cultural economy, the best-seller list is a lagging indicator. Even \u201cinstant\u201d books need time to be pitched, approved, written and printed, so it can take months for the list to catch up with the zeitgeist. That\u2019s why it\u2019s too soon to say how Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s recent ouster from Fox News over multiple sexual harassment claims might affect the fortunes of Bill O\u2019Reilly, author. For now, though, there are still a couple of O\u2019Reilly titles on the hardcover nonfiction list: \u201cKilling the Rising Sun,\u201d about the end of World War II, is No. 13, and \u201cOld School,\u201d about the importance of traditional values, is No. 4. AYUH: Anita Shreve\u2019s new novel, \u201cThe Stars Are Fire,\u201d about a series of wildfires in 1940s Maine, hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 11. (Mary Pols\u2019s review is on Page 17.) \u201cI seem to be particularly drawn to Maine,\u201d Shreve told WBUR Radio in Boston recently. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of flintiness of character that echoes the jagged rocks and the view of the sea.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/books/review/elizabeth-warren-really-does-not-like-donald-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:22-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "List", "created_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:22-04:00", "abstract": "\u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight,\u201d new on the hardcover nonfiction list, is nominally about the economy.
