{"text": "\u201c*** massive reversal of fortune.\u201d This was a line I had written in my notes on this week\u2019s episode of \u201cBillions,\u201d the best one to date. I wrote the line right after Axe ended a triumphant day on Wall Street by reconciling with his wife over pizza topped with caviar, a sublime culinary fusion of their humble roots and upward mobility. All season long, Axe and Chuck have been on opposing trajectories, with Axe paying for his hyper-aggression on plays like Sandicot while Chuck, buried in civil suits and multiple threats to his job, has been rope-a-doping his way back to the top. Nevertheless, it made sense to assume that Axe\u2019s short on Ice Juice, with all the Rhoades family money on the line, would be the \u201cmassive reversal of fortune\u201d that notched that one big victory that had been eluding him all season. Nope. The four lines in my notes that immediately followed: \u201cLara trying but not entirely back with him\u201d \u201cChuck back to hotel room (serious stretch that he wouldn\u2019t take wife\u2019s advice)\u201d \u201ccries about his losses\u201d \u201cThree Weeks Ago\u201d It\u2019s a wonderful feeling to be hoodwinked by masterly plotting, and this episode is the long-term play that creators Brian Koppelman and David Levien, who wrote it, have been cooking up all season long. Our assumption that Chuck\u2019s winning streak will have to end figures into it, along with the succession of losers Paul Giamatti has played throughout his career. (The triumphant reprise of Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cEven the Losers\u201d is a laugh-out-loud moment.) But what really sells the twist is the way Koppelman and Levien have already gone to astonishing lengths to reveal the sophistication of Axe\u2019s effort to sabotage the Ice Juice initial public offering. There\u2019s no reasonable expectation that any counterplotting by Chuck would or could be in the offing. There was plenty to admire in Axe\u2019s handiwork, to say nothing of the script\u2019s expert machinations. The title \u201cThree Weeks Ago\u201d quickens the pulse. In a couple of episodes earlier this season, including the premiere, \u201cBillions\u201d had deployed \u201c[X] Weeks Ago\u201d as a framing device, so there\u2019s initially no reason to suppose that anything special was going to happen here. The episode opens with \u201cTwo Weeks Ago\u201d and then continues pressing forward with other time stamps as Axe and his people lay the foundations for Chipotle-level public health disaster on the day of Ice Juice\u2019s highly anticipated I.P.O. When Koppelman and Levien return to the same structural gamesmanship after Axe has seemingly won the day, it\u2019s like the reveal of a \u201chow did they do that?\u201d magic trick: Now all the earlier events, the ones that seemed so deviously clever on Axe\u2019s part, are upended piece by piece. \u201cEven the losers get lucky sometimes,\u201d sings Petty, but luck has nothing to do with it. The episode follows through on the idea that Chuck has figured out how his rival ticks and has adjusted his strategy accordingly. His judo instructor tips us off after Chuck pins an opponent to the mat: \u201cYou had to give him something, an opportunity, and you used it against him.\u201d Chuck baited Axe on Ice Juice, knowing he couldn\u2019t resist the chance to fleece the Rhoades boys, and boxed him into committing a criminal act in full view of the F.B.I. and Oliver Dake, the newly appointed United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. To reference another Koppelman-Levien script, Chuck is like Matt Damon at the end of \u201cRounders\u201d when he figures out John Malkovich\u2019s tell and lures him into shoving all his chips into the pot with the worst hand. In poker terms, Axe is a \u201cloose-aggressive\u201d player, someone who likes to control the action and bully the tighter players into folding, which can be an extremely effective strategy, provided that your betting patterns are varied and unpredictable. Axe\u2019s problem is that Chuck has picked up on his betting patterns and knows exactly the right time to exploit his aggression. \u201cFoolishness is right next door to strength,\u201d Wendy tells Chuck when he refuses to heed her warning about Axe\u2019s shorting Ice Juice stock. But what she doesn\u2019t know is that Chuck understands this already and it\u2019s Axe who\u2019s the fool. Wendy cautions her husband about playing in Axe\u2019s arena, the stock market, but the game is really being played in Chuck\u2019s arena, the law, and few others know it yet. Amid all the rug-pulling, the episode also solidifies Taylor\u2019s status as a major player at Axe Capital and a major character on the show. Asked to evaluate all the analysts and \u201cshiv\u201d the weakest one, Taylor pushes through some deep-seated anxiety and learns to modify a strictly numbers-based evaluation and understand the intangible qualities of those who might be weaker on paper. Beyond this initiation into office culture \u2014 and Wags makes sure it\u2019s a hazing \u2014 Taylor also has to accept the unseemly business of working among the rogues, which here takes the form of a giant duffle bag stuffed with $250,000 of rainy-day funds. \u201cEveryone in our line of work needs cash squirreled away,\u201d says Dollar Bill Stern. Taylor flinches a little at the thought, but opts to stay on the slippery slope. Bulls and Bears: \u2022 Wags remembering the first time he got to fire someone: \u201cIt tasted as sweet as the Mata Hari\u2019s armpits.\u201d \u2022 The meetings between Taylor and Wendy have been a healthy affirmation that Wendy knows how to do her unusual job exceptionally well. Wendy gains some essential insights into Taylor that aren\u2019t freely given away. She doesn\u2019t let \u201cI\u2019m used to radical shifts\u201d go without pressing further into uncertainties rooted in Taylor\u2019s childhood. \u2022 Funny timing for the Ice Juice episode to coincide with the misfortunes of Juicero, a Silicon Valley venture that began losing its cachet after it was discovered that human hands could accomplish the same goal as its $400 juice press. \u2022 \u201cBillions\u201d almost never makes reference to real-world politics, so it\u2019s notable to hear Wags talk about Chuck\u2019s father gloating at Mar-a-Lago about his Palm Beach estate. But will Chuck Sr. be able to afford that new $200,000 membership fee?", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/television/billions-recap-golden-frog-time.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T23:02:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-30T23:02:03-04:00", "abstract": "It\u2019s a wonderful feeling to get hoodwinked by masterly plotting, and this episode is the long-term play that has been brewing all season long.", "title": "\u2018Billions\u2019 Season 2, Episode 11: Even the Losers Get Plucky"}
