{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here\u2019s the latest. 1. It\u2019s been a whirlwind week in Washington, as the administration rolls out initiatives ahead of President Trump\u2019s 100-day mark. On the tax plan: It was remarkably short on details (\u201call ponies and no manure,\u201d one expert said). Economists say it would vastly expand the country\u2019s budget deficit and national debt \u2014 and offer the greatest benefits to the wealthiest Americans. Above, President Mauricio Macri and the first lady, Juliana Awada, of Argentina visited the White House. _____ 2. From Capitol Hill came news that the Defense Department is investigating Michael Flynn, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, over payments from Russia. House Democrats threatened to withhold their support for a stopgap spending plan if Republicans press for a vote on their health care bill. But our best guess is that a government shutdown this weekend will be averted. And House Speaker Paul Ryan observed Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day. _____ 3. President Trump said he yielded to pleas from the leaders of Canada and Mexico and agreed not to withdraw immediately from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Many Mexicans are starting to see Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-trade rhetoric as mere stagecraft. Above, trucks wait to cross into El Paso, Tex., from Mexico. \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s sitting at a poker table bluffing rather than making serious decisions,\u201d a Mexican legislator said. _____  4. China reacted harshly to news that the antimissile system the U.S. set up in South Korea is nearly operational. The Pentagon\u2019s Pacific commander said the crisis over North Korea was \u201cthe worst\u201d he\u2019d seen, but experts say war is not imminent. Our reporter found a good deal of nonchalance in Seoul, though children still learn how to use gas masks in case of an attack. _____  5. The fourth prisoner in seven days is set to be executed tonight at a prison in southeast Arkansas. This case has resonated the most in the surrounding rural community. The condemned, Kenneth Williams, escaped 17 years ago and killed an assistant warden living nearby. _____ 6. Syria blamed Israel for a series of explosions at warehouses near the Damascus airport that Israeli news reports said were full of weapons bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. The fires could be seen from a distance. Israel doesn\u2019t usually confirm military actions in Syria, but its intelligence minister said the strike was \u201cconsistent\u201d with its goals. _____ 7. Pope Francis heads to Egypt on Friday, just weeks after the Palm Sunday terrorist attacks on two Coptic churches there. Al Azhar mosque, above, will be among his stops. He\u2019s to meet with Christian and Muslim leaders, and he\u2019s expected to press for the protection of minority rights in a sit-down with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. _____ 8. Can we talk about a commuting nightmare? Amtrak is planning major repairs at New York\u2019s Penn Station this summer that will close several tracks \u2014 officials declined to be specific about how many and for how long. Hundreds of thousands of commuters stream daily through the station, North America\u2019s busiest, for Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road trains. _____ 9. Two takes on motherhood, sparked by two very famous mothers. Our fashion writer says Beyonc\u00e9 \u201chas created a new paradigm for what it means to be a pregnant woman in the public eye.\u201d There\u2019s just one problem: She\u2019s setting the bar too high. And then there\u2019s Serena Williams, who won the Australian Open at eight weeks. One obstetrician we spoke with called it \u201can amazing feat.\u201d _____  10. Finally, the late-night comedians had some fun with the White House\u2019s tax plan. \u201cPresident Trump unveiled his new tax plan today, and it\u2019s pretty much the same as his old plan,\u201d Seth Meyers quipped. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to pay them.\u201d _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
