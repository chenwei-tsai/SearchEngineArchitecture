Any hitter can luck into a bloop single. Any slugger can drive a mistake to the seats. The Mets seem incapable of doing much offensively, but they do take big swings. \u201cWe\u2019re a bloop and a blast away, in the last 10 games, of winning every game,\u201d Manager Terry Collins said before batting practice Sunday. \u201cWe have the kind of team that can do that. When our guys get in the batter\u2019s box, we\u2019ve got a chance to hit a homer. Now, the weather has not been conducive; we\u2019ve hit some balls that have gone nowhere. But you still feel like you can.\u201d Even more chilling, on Sunday night, was the presence of the Washington Nationals\u2019 Max Scherzer, who has won two Cy Young Awards. Scherzer has also thrown two no-hitters, including a singular masterpiece at Citi Field in 2015: the only no-hitter ever with no walks and at least 17 strikeouts. Those Mets shrugged and went to the World Series. These Mets, of course, want to get back. But before Sunday\u2019s matchup, they had sputtered to seven losses in eight games, and Washington looked fearsome. Collins said he was not overly concerned. He insisted, with odd specificity, that the Mets would have a nine-game winning streak at some point and jump right back in it. Yes, he has to say things like that, but Collins also never denies the problems facing his team. Unless the Mets hit homers, they are almost helpless. The nature of their offense limits what a manager can do. \u201cThe ideal team is to have seven guys who can run and hit homers, steal bases and play defense and throw everybody out,\u201d Collins said with a laugh. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to look at the strengths of your team, and you\u2019ve got to utilize your strengths. I hear a lot of comments about: \u2018You got to bunt more.\u2019 I\u2019m asking guys to fail. They don\u2019t bunt. We are not a bunting team.\u201d He continued: \u201cSo my job is to put these guys in situations where their strengths play and not to have them go and use their weaknesses. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re built, and you\u2019ve got to accept it.\u201d Before Sunday, the Mets ranked second in the majors in homers, with 27, but only two teams had fewer doubles. Only three teams had a lower batting average than the Mets\u2019 .211. The Mets ranked third in walks but were last in stolen bases. The Mets also had the oldest group of position players in the National League, with an average age of 30.3 years, and speed rarely ages well. The Mets do have Jose Reyes, the last major leaguer with 75 or more stolen bases in a season. But that was in 2007, and Reyes, now 33, had six hits in 63 at-bats \u2014 an .095 average \u2014 before Sunday, when Collins put him back in the lineup after having left him out on Saturday. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on base, I can make a lot of stuff happen, and I\u2019m not able to do that so far,\u201d Reyes said after Collins benched him. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of frustrating for me, because the game that I play is getting on base, making stuff happen, stealing bases, scoring runs and stuff like that. That stuff is good for your ball club, and I feel I\u2019m not able to do that so far.\u201d It is asking too much to rely on this version of Reyes to be more than a role player. But the Mets are not teeming with options. Besides the injured corner infielders \u2014 Lucas Duda and David Wright \u2014 they are missing the versatile Wilmer Flores. Collins wanted Travis d\u2019Arnaud to catch on Sunday, but d\u2019Arnaud said his injured right wrist was still sore. Then there is Yoenis Cespedes, who missed his third start in a row on Sunday with a left hamstring strain. Since trading for Cespedes in 2015, the Mets are 114-81 when he starts and 18-26 when he does not. If he \u2014 and d\u2019Arnaud \u2014 are not better by Tuesday, Collins said, the Mets will consider the disabled list. Even when the Mets\u2019 lineup is at full strength, however, its fundamental nature will not change. The Mets are unabashed power hitters, a leading example of the modern hitting ethos: Don\u2019t worry about singles or subtlety, just work the count and do damage. Last season they were fifth in the majors in homers, 25th in batting average and 28th in steals. Yet even with a rash of pitching injuries, they won the top N.L. wild-card spot. Now the Mets\u2019 top three starting pitchers are healthy, which means the team\u2019s approach \u2014 as maddening as it can be \u2014 has a chance to work. \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about it,\u201d outfielder Curtis Granderson said, \u201cknowing that even if we don\u2019t score a bunch of runs, if our pitching staff does what they\u2019re capable of, just keep us in the ballgame, we can find ways to get it done without having to be a certain type of team.\u201d Dominant pitching, with the hope of a bloop and a blast. That formula is not quite working yet, but for the Mets, it is their best \u2014 and only \u2014 choice.", "abstract": "The major leagues\u2019 second-best team at hitting home runs hasn\u2019t been able to put enough runners on base for its sluggers."}
