{"text": "Good morning.  Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022  China reacted harshly to news that the Thaad antimissile system the U.S. set up in South Korea is nearly operational. \u201cThis will further tighten the Asia-Pacific antimissile barrier enclosing China and Russia, and will weaken their strategic capacities \u2014 something we adamantly oppose,\u201d a top Chinese military official said. The Pentagon\u2019s Pacific commander said the crisis over North Korea was \u201cthe worst\u201d he\u2019d seen, but experts on the region say despite recent American military moves, war is not imminent. Our reporter found the mood essentially nonchalant in Seoul. _____ \u2022 President Trump said he yielded to pleas from the leaders of Canada and Mexico and agreed not to withdraw immediately from North American Free Trade Agreement, which he has repeatedly called \u201ca disaster.\u201d And economists told our business columnist that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to radically reorder the tax code could vastly expand the country\u2019s budget deficit and national debt. And the U.S. State Department is likely to remain understaffed and largely leaderless until well into 2018. _____ \u2022 Pope Francis begins a politically delicate trip to Egypt today. The visit comes just weeks after the Palm Sunday terrorist attacks on two Coptic churches in Egypt, the deadliest acts of violence against Christians in the country in decades. _____ \u2022  Explosions at warehouses rocked the Damascus airport, in what Syrian and rebel officials say was a strike carried out by Israel to target weapons bound for Hezbollah. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, suggested that his country would likely agree to any American request to assist in strikes on Syria. _____ \u2022 An American visa program expiring today could leave wealthy non-Americans with one less avenue for access to a U.S. green card. The EB-5 program, which is likely to be overhauled in Washington, has allowed foreigners and their immediate relatives \u2014 most often Chinese \u2014 to apply for permanent residency if they invested $500,000 in job-creating projects in areas with high unemployment, or $1 million in projects in other areas. Above, a Beijing lawyer who specializes in the EB-5 process. _____ \u2022 And a big surprise in science: Archaeologists no longer need to be thrown a bone. Using methods that took years to develop, scientists in Germany recovered ancient DNA from cave dirt, opening the door to new insights on human prehistory. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like discovering that you can extract gold dust from the air,\u201d a researcher commented. \u2022 A crackdown on polluting mines in the Philippines could sharply reduce the country\u2019s world-leading export of nickel ore. \u2022 After many years spent battling legions of counterfeit manufacturers, New Balance won an intellectual property dispute in China. \u2022 United Airlines will offer passengers who volunteer to change flights up to $10,000 in travel certificates. The company is seeking to recover from several public relations disasters. The latest involved a giant dead rabbit. \u2022 U.S. stocks were up slightly. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 All 78 crew members were rescued from a Russian naval ship after it collided with a private livestock vessel and sank in heavy fog near the Bosporus. [The New York Times] \u2022 Leaders of the 10 Asean nations begin two days of meetings in Manila that appear likely to focus more on economic issues than China\u2019s growing dominance. [Bloomberg] \u2022 Nine pro-democracy activists were arrested in Hong Kong, where the authorities appear to be cracking down on dissent two months before a scheduled visit by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. [The New York Times] \u2022 A court in Senegal upheld the war-crimes conviction of Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9, the former leader of a murderous regime in Chad. [The New York Times] \u2022 An Israeli-American teenager accused of making hundreds of false bomb threats against schools, airlines, hospitals and Jewish centers in the U.S., Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Israel may have been selling his disruptive services. [Sydney Morning Herald] \u2022 A German soldier with a \u201cxenophobic background\u201d is suspected of posing as a Syrian asylum seeker and planning a violent attack. [The New York Times] \u2022 Three refugees on Manus Island contested allegations made by Peter Dutton, Australia\u2019s immigration minister, that they triggered a shooting rampage by giving fruit to a hungry child. [The Guardian] \u2022 The Shanghai Auto Show, which closes today, showcases a range of electrified vehicles. [Hybrid Cars] \u2022 Skip the college tour.

Today, \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d the eighth installment of the action movie franchise starring Vin Diesel, opens in theaters across Japan. But if you happen to be there, you\u2019ll be forgiven for not finding it on cinema schedules. That\u2019s because, in Japan, the movie is called \u201cWild Speed: Ice Break.\u201d This is not the first time that films in the franchise have been promoted under different names in Japan or elsewhere. Movie titles are frequently changed to resonate better with local audiences. In Japan, the sixth movie in the franchise, which focused on Europe, was advertised as \u201cWild Speed: Euro Mission.\u201d The seventh, \u201cWild Speed: Sky Mission,\u201d included a scene featuring cars falling from a plane. If the latest film\u2019s performance in China (where it was called \u201cSpeed and Passion\u201d) is any guide, changing movie titles can help boost ticket sales. Of the $432 million the movie made overseas on its opening weekend, $190 million came from China. In Hong Kong, the movie was advertised as \u201cWild Speed\u201d and in Taiwan as \u201cThe Moment You Play with Death.\u201d (In Europe, the title was far more literal: \u201cFast and Furious 8.\u201d) Regardless of where you are, if you haven\u2019t seen the film, here\u2019s our review.
