{"text": "Ever since President Trump took office (and even before that), The New York Times has been capturing the most important moments on video. On January 20, Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States. His message was grim but confident. \u201cThis American carnage,\u201d he declared, \u201cstops right here and stops right now.\u201d The next day, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in protest for the Women\u2019s March. President Trump\u2019s cabinet began to take shape even before Inauguration Day. He brought together insiders like Reince Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman, outsiders like Stephen K. Bannon and millionaires like Betsy DeVos. On January 25, President Trump signed an executive order directing the construction of a Mexican border wall, a signature campaign talking point. Times video journalists looked at how the promise to build the wall gained momentum, and at the debate over who would pay for it. President Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cProtecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.\u201d The order indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and blocked citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the country for 90 days. Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, resigned in February after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials about conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The Justice Department feared this lack of disclosure could make Mr. Flynn vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow. \u201cNobody knew that health care could be so complicated.\u201d That\u2019s what President Trump said less than a month before the Republicans failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act at the end of March. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan acknowledged that Obamacare would be the law of the land for the foreseeable future. In April, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate to become the 113th justice of the Supreme Court. Adam Liptak explained the \u201celaborate dance\u201d that nominees perform in order to secure a confirmation. The final tally was 54-45. One of the worst chemical attacks of the Syrian civil war took place in April, killing dozens. The United States held President Bashar al-Assad responsible. In an exclusive interview with Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush, President Trump called the attack \u201can affront to humanity.\u201d Hours later, he gave the order to drop 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles on an airfield in western Syria. There are potential showdowns ahead over tax policy, health care, environmental regulations and more. No matter what happens, The Times will be here recording it all.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/first-100-days-donald-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T15:03:28-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T15:03:28-04:00", "abstract": "Here are highlights of the 45th president\u2019s first 100 days in office.", "title": "A Video Tour of President Trump\u2019s First 100 Days"}
