{"text": "Alexis De La Rosa, 19, attends Middlebury College in Vermont on a full-tuition scholarship. He is majoring in pre-med and theater, which he says are \u201cpolar opposite fields of study\u201d but \u201cdefinitely provide a nice balance.\u201d This would not be Mr. De La Rosa\u2019s first tricky balancing act. He was 7 when he learned how to swim. At the time, he lived with his mother and three siblings in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. That summer, his mother wanted to find something different for him to do. So off he went on a bus to New Canaan, Conn., for a two-week stay with the Reeds, a volunteer host family for the Fresh Air Fund. Although getting to know new people in new surroundings was difficult at first, he eventually settled in. And when the Reeds invited him back the next year, he happily agreed. \u201cThe second summer was so much better,\u201d Mr. De La Rosa said, \u201cand the relationships got stronger.\u201d He continued to visit the Reeds for several summers. Most days were spent swimming, diving and playing tennis, with a few reading and math lessons in between. For Mr. De La Rosa, it was the \u201clittle things that resonated,\u201d like having a daily routine that he was able to apply when he got back home. By the time he reached high school, he worked up enough courage to join the swim team. Mr. De La Rosa says he still plans to go to medical school one day, but he will take a year or two after graduation to explore \u201cwhat the theater world has to offer.\u201d He still keeps in touch with the Reeds. They have provided educational advice and emotional support through the different phases of his life. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI feel really comfortable in any space that I\u2019m put in.\u201d This year, the fund aims to serve more than 7,000 New York City children from low-income communities and hopes to raise $12 million by the end of September. Many children also participate in year-round academic enrichment programs. The cost of sending a child on a two-week vacation with a host family is $1,172, and one session at a summer camp is $1,925. Tax-deductible donations can be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 633 Third Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10017, or made online at freshair.org. Families who wish to be hosts can write to the same address, fill out a host inquiry online or call 800-367-0003.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/fresh-air-fund-diving-into-summer.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T21:59:26-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "created_date": "2017-04-28T21:59:26-04:00", "abstract": "The organization gives thousands of children the opportunity to get out of the city.
