{"text": "The question is not whether a new Kosciuszko Bridge is needed (it is), nor whether a cable-stayed Kosciuszko Bridge looks better than the old through-truss crossing (it does). The question is: How is it pronounced? Tadeusz Kosciuszko \u2014 properly, Ko\u015bciuszko \u2014 was a hero of the Revolutionary War. Born in Poland in 1746 and trained there as a military engineer, Kosciusko arrived in America in 1776. The fortifications he designed along the Hudson River, most important at West Point, were widely credited with keeping British forces at bay. He later championed Polish nationhood, fighting bravely for what was then a lost cause. He died in exile in 1817 from his partitioned homeland. Poland was under German occupation in 1940 when Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia named the new Meeker Avenue Bridge between Brooklyn and Queens in honor of Kosciuszko. Fifteen thousand Poles and Polish-Americans attended the ceremony. \u201cI am confident that Poland will live again,\u201d John J. Bennett Jr., the New York State attorney general, told the crowd. It was a stirring gesture and a fine reminder of America\u2019s indebtedness to Poland. It has also caused nothing but grief ever since. New Yorkers have struggled to master the Polish pronunciation or \u2014 as they are given to doing \u2014 have invented their own. \u201cThere are many variations regarding Kosciuszko\u2019s pronunciation,\u201d Marta Hausman, the public diplomacy assistant at the Polish consulate general in New York, acknowledged by email. \u201cThe closest one is: ko-SHCH-OO-SH-ko.\u201d Maciej Golubiewski, the consul general of Poland, nailed it on Thursday at the dedication of the new bridge. (\u201cKosciuszko Bridge Opening\u201d on YouTube, at minute 12:25.) Of course, you would expect nothing less. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo came admirably close, but seemed to miss the second \u201csh.\u201d (Minute 18:44.) The announcer, however, gave Kosciuszko a New York twist all its own: \u201cKoch-ee-OH-sko.\u201d (Minute 00:10.) Now, that is much more in line with such customary local pronunciations as \u201cKos-kee-OOS-ko\u201d and \u201cKos-kee-OSS-ko.\u201d It is easy to see why state officials simply call it the \u201cK Bridge.\u201d And it is not the only new bridge with a name that poses a pronunciation challenge. At the Goethals Bridge, new and old, some use a short \u201co,\u201d others a long \u201co.\u201d The third project is the New New York Bridge, which is to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge. It is pronounced \u201cNOO-nyawk.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/kosciuszko-bridge-pronounciation.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T19:36:38-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T19:34:29-04:00", "abstract": "There is a reason New York State officials refer to the crossing over the Newtown Creek as the \u2018K Bridge.\u2019 They do not want to pronounce Kosciuszko.", "title": "How Do You Pronounce Kosciuszko?
