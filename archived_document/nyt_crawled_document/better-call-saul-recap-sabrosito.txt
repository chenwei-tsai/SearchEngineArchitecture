{"text": "Episode-opening images don\u2019t get more promising than this: the sight of Don Eladio, the backslapping Mexican drug lord, diving blissfully into his backyard pool. Fans of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d recognize this shot as a callback to a moment that is chronologically in the future \u2014 Eladio\u2019s demise in Season 4. You may recall that later dive as an involuntary reaction to the lethal poison that Gus Fring delivered by way of a bottle of very expensive liquor, the endgame of his counterattack against the cartel. For those who hoped that \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d would tell the stories of the most unforgettably villainous characters from \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d watching this week\u2019s episode was like greeting a beloved friend whom you feared had died. Hello again, Don Eladio\u2019s hacienda, which a bit of Google searching reveals is actually located in New Mexico and is up for sale at a reduced price of just over $1 million. We weren\u2019t simply reintroduced to these people and their web of meth, cash and forced bonhomie. We learned new parts of their back stories and thus their motivations. Specifically, we learned why Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis) loathes Gus. Gus\u2019s meth is so profitable that when his patron, a toupee-sporting Juan Bolsa (Javier Grajeda), shows up to pay tribute to Don Eladio, he brings far more greenbacks than Hector. And the superior haul is even packed and presented more neatly. It\u2019s humiliating! It\u2019s plain that Hector and his Albuquerque operation, fronted by an ice cream store called El Griego Gui\u00f1ador (\u201cThe Winking Greek\u201d), is no match for Gus and his operation, fronted by fried chicken. Hector\u2019s supply route was \u201ccompromised\u201d in the previous episode, and now we understand a new facet of Hector\u2019s rage: No doubt he suspects that Gus was behind the \u201caccident\u201d that led the D.E.A. to El Griego, which is busted early in this episode. Worse, without those ice cream trucks driving back and forth to Mexico, Gus is going to out-earn Hector yet again. It\u2019s too much for one cantankerous homophobe and bully to take. So he resorts to tactics as blatant and public as Gus\u2019s are subtle and invisible. He and his henchmen walk straight into Los Pollos Hermanos and hold the store\u2019s employees in a kind of captivity until the boss shows up. The scene is filled with delightful menace, enlivened by Margolis\u2019s scene-shredding approach to Hector\u2019s toxic personal habits, which include picking dog poo off his shoes and onto Gus\u2019s desk. Think for a moment about the self-control on display in the moment that Gus finds Hector puffing nonchalantly in his office. It\u2019s not only that Hector might have just blown Gus\u2019s carefully devised cover as a civic-minded entrepreneur \u2014 who is glad-handing the fire department right as his flagship store is being invaded. Hector is also the man who, years earlier, shot Max Arciniega, Gus\u2019s original Pollos Hermanos partner and, by all accounts, the only man that Gus ever loved. (At minimum, we\u2019ve never seen him with anyone else.) We understand what Gus means when he tells Mike that a bullet to Hector\u2019s head would not result in a sufficiently painful death. One of many blanks yet to be filled in this yarn is how, exactly, Hector winds up mute and in a wheelchair, speaking only by means of a bell he rings with one finger. It seems obvious now that Gus will have a decisive hand in whatever lands Hector in that terrible condition. At the same time, Round 27 of the Jimmy vs. Chuck battle royale finds Jimmy back to his underhanded ways. He has called in a favor, asking Mike to show up at Chuck\u2019s house as a handyman to fix the door Jimmy busted. And thus the list of Mike\u2019s skills grows longer, although the main point of his visit has nothing to do with the power tools he uses to keep Chuck at bay. He\u2019s there to take a bunch of photographs, which he later shows to Jimmy. What is the point of this illicit photographing exercise? Let\u2019s tally up what we know. First, the pictures will be somehow be involved with a hearing to determine whether Jimmy should be disbarred. Second, the shot that tickles Jimmy the most is the one of a gas lantern sitting on top of a stack of newspapers. (\u201cThat tells the whole story,\u201d he tells Mike, while they eat together at a diner.) Third, in addition to photos, Mike also hands over a piece of paper. We learn nothing about it, other than that it came from Chuck\u2019s address book, or from very near it. And that\u2019s it, for now. I was glad to see Kim offering some invaluable aid during this caper. I was worried that she was going to spend this season as a moral compass, which is just no fun for anyone, especially viewers. I hope she is just getting warmed up. Bring on wicked Kim! Less impressive to me was the moment in the opening scene when Don Eladio tells Hector that he appears jealous of all the money produced by Gus. As the maxim has it, great writers show, they don\u2019t tell. It was blatantly obvious that Hector\u2019s feelings were hurt. Don Eladio\u2019s line jumped out as exactly the sort of thing that characters in \u201cSaul\u201d don\u2019t say because \u201cSaul\u201d writers know they don\u2019t need to say it. We know who the ultimate winners will be in the coming contests. (Take a bow, Jimmy and Gus.) We just don\u2019t know how they will win, nor do we know what those victories will cost them. I\u2019m eager to find out. Along the way, we\u2019ll learn the point of Mike\u2019s turn as the Ansel Adams of indoor photography, to paraphrase Jimmy. I\u2019m stumped, which is exactly what I am supposed to be, it seems. When Kim says \u201cBingo\u201d near the end of this episode, we know that Chuck has walked into a trap of some kind. We also know that Jimmy is ultimately not disbarred, since he lives to practice law, albeit under a different name. Other than that, we are guessing. And guessing is fun, so if you\u2019re so inclined, provide a theory in the comments section.
