{"text": "THE GIVERS Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age By David Callahan 343 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $28.95 Imagine you have more money than you know what to do with. Not tens of millions of dollars, but hundreds of millions \u2014 billions even. After acquiring that dream villa on Lake Como, a vintage Bugatti and a seat on Elon Musk\u2019s maiden voyage to Mars, what would you do with the rest of your fortune? Buy the Yankees? Pay the Kardashians to disappear? O.K. But then what? Among America\u2019s ultrarich, more and more people are making the laudable, if not wholly selfless, decision to give it away. Much like the poor, philanthropists have always been with us. Certainly, the United States has enjoyed its share of Rockefellers and Carnegies over the years. But in \u201cThe Givers,\u201d David Callahan aims to introduce a new breed of megadonors\u2014 more numerous, more aggressive and vastly richer than their forebears \u2014 poised to reshape American society to an unprecedented degree. This, he contends, should make everyone at least a teensy bit nervous. \u201cThe Givers\u201d concerns itself with the tippy-top tiers of \u201cthe philanthrosphere.\u201d We\u2019re not talking here about bush-leaguers like Bill and Hillary Clinton, whose family foundation has to go scrounging for other people\u2019s money. Callahan focuses on the biggest of big givers \u2014 people like Bill Gates, the Walton clan, Mark Zuckerberg and Warren Buffett, who actually struggle to give away their fortunes because the money multiplies faster than they can shovel it out the door. The book covers all the basics: Who are these people? Why do they give? What causes do they favor, and how much impact do they have? The founder and editor of the website Inside Philanthropy, Callahan clearly knows the game and its players. This has its drawbacks. Especially in the early going, the book can feel laundry listy. After spending a couple of pages ticking through top Wall Street givers, he assures readers: \u201cI could name many additional donors coming out of finance, like Jeremy Grantham, Seth Klarman, Louis Bacon, George Roberts, Glenn Dubin, Kenneth Griffin, Michael Milken, Henry Kravis and Leon Black.\u201d All right already. You know your stuff. Can we please move on? Happily, Callahan hustles through the preliminaries and into a sweeping exploration of what makes mega-givers tick, how they operate and how they differ from their predecessors. Today\u2019s masters of the universe, for instance, are donating at a much younger age and taking a much more hands-on approach. Forget spending decades amassing piles of cash to be handed over in the twilight of life to endow some foundation. These folks want to start saving the world right now. Especially absorbing is Callahan\u2019s probing of mega-givers\u2019 psyches. Of course tech billionaires are all about risk-taking and disruption and tackling problems no one else is addressing. That\u2019s how they got to be billionaires in the first place. (They are \u201cmore ready by disposition to embrace the adage that philanthropy \u2018is society\u2019s risk capital.\u2019\u201d) Wall Street donors are often drawn to the \u201cstewardship model of philanthropy\u201d and prefer to support well established institutions \u2014 universities, hospitals, land conservation trusts and so on. (\u201cThey\u2019re more into charity than change.\u201d) \u201cTitans of the old economy\u201d tend to be older, more methodical, less creative and more political. Another significant development is the growing focus on data. (Even the philanthrosphere, it seems, has been invaded by the quants.) Givers are demanding an ever-clearer picture of what\u2019s working and how to get the biggest bang for their bucks. Callahan devotes a chapter to givers\u2019 quest for \u201cleverage points,\u201d most notably the strategic use of the court system to effect change. As suggested by the book\u2019s subtitle, Callahan is not here merely to praise the new philanthropists. His core mission is to sound the alarm about how even the best intentioned among them are distorting American society and eroding \u201cthe egalitarian ethos so core to our national identity.\u201d By now, pretty much everyone recognizes the potentially corrupting aspects of big-dollar political giving. Callahan\u2019s contention is that big-dollar philanthropy affords its purveyors even greater influence, with fewer downsides and vastly less accountability. Sinking millions into, say, a presidential campaign subjects givers to intense public scrutiny and may ultimately win them nothing. Funding a nonprofit to sway thinking on, say, climate change or marriage equality or school choice \u2014 pick your issue \u2014 is a lower-profile, less risky, more enduring investment. \u201cThe Givers\u201d is not a big-P political book. While Callahan takes issue with ideologically motivated giving dressed up as philanthropy (and with politically minded nonprofits enjoying the same tax status as traditional charities), he endeavors to be bipartisan in his scolding. For every tale of a conservative pushing supply-side economics or traditional marriage via \u201ccharitable\u201d giving, he spotlights a liberal bankrolling gun control or clean energy. One positive byproduct of the swelling pool of mega-givers, he notes, is the philanthrosphere\u2019s growing ideological diversity. You may hate how Charles Koch doles out his billions but delight in how George Soros uses his. Or vice versa. Callahan stresses that it is not the specific aims of givers that make Big Philanthropy problematic so much as the fact that it\u2019s, well, big. Rich people wielding inordinate clout in any sphere is profoundly undemocratic, he contends, repeatedly lamenting that philanthropy is \u201coccupying a bigger seat at the table of power than at any time in the past century,\u201d even as \u201cordinary Americans struggle to get their voices heard at all.\u201d To the point of distraction, he asks \u201cwhether we think it\u2019s O.K. overall for any philanthropists to have so much power to advance their own vision of a better society?\u201d Indeed, the book can be exhausting in its quest to hammer home the warping nature of Big Philanthropy. By the time Callahan makes the case that charitable giving actually perpetuates dynastic influence more than simply leaving one\u2019s offspring a big pile of cash, many readers will be ready to throw up their hands in exasperation. So now we\u2019re supposed to fret about rich people being too socially conscious? What exactly does this guy want? For all his efforts toward partisan balance, Callahan has a clear political perspective. A co-founder of the progressive think tank Demos, he is an unapologetic fan of big government \u2014 which, as he sees it, is the proper shaper of society. Central to his concern about philanthropy\u2019s clout is that it is waxing as government\u2019s is waning. He warns in the prologue, \u201cWe face a future in which private donors \u2014 who are accountable to no one \u2014 may often wield more influence than elected public officials, who (in theory, anyway) are accountable to all of us.\u201d (That \u201cin theory\u201d covers a multitude of sins. While it\u2019s not Callahan\u2019s aim to grapple with the gross dysfunction of our political system, his periodic touting of the oh-so-democratic accountability of public officials nonetheless comes off as vaguely credulous.) It is not until the epilogue that Callahan really lets his progressive flag fly. He offers a handful of reform ideas that will feel familiar to anyone who has followed the money-in-politics debate over the years: greater transparency (especially when it comes to the \u201cdark philanthropic money\u201d channeled through opaque vehicles like \u201cdonor-advised funds\u201d), stricter tax guidelines and increased government regulation. (He suggests a new \u201coffice of charitable affairs\u201d to help on that front.) With such prescriptions, Callahan seeks \u201cto target the philanthropic behavior that\u2019s most troubling, not hobble the sector as a whole.\u201d But this also means that, as Callahan acknowledges, even the most ambitious of his reforms would do little to alter the fundamental nature, or spiraling influence, of the greater philanthrosphere. As Callahan sees it, the only way to knock us off the path of \u201cbenign plutocracy\u201d is \u201cto revive government as a dynamic agent of change\u201d \u2014 which is the modest proposal he presents in literally his final three pages. Such a revival would involve huge shifts in spending priorities, tax hikes on the wealthy and an overhaul of agencies. In other words: It would require an entirely different political and social climate than the one we have. Then again, tackling seemingly intractable problems is what Big Philanthropy is all about. As such, it seems uncharitable to deny Callahan his dreams of a more egalitarian world. Many readers no doubt will share Callahan\u2019s views on the dark side of Big Philanthropy, and his ideas for addressing it. But even those who don\u2019t should give \u201cThe Givers\u201d a go. Callahan offers a peek inside a rarefied, poorly understood world with ever greater power to remake the broader world. It\u2019s an engaging, thought-provoking tour well worth the taking.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/books/review/givers-wealth-power-philanthropy-david-callahan.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T07:00:27-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T07:00:27-04:00", "abstract": "David Callahan\u2019s \u201cThe Givers\u201d examines a new wave of philanthropists: how they operate, what makes them tick.", "title": "Are the New Megadonors Distorting American Society?"}
