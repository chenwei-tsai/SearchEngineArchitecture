{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 If nothing else, President Trump has already secured a place in history. It is his grasp of history that seems less secure. In his latest foray into what might be called the alternative past, Mr. Trump suggested that Andrew Jackson had been \u201creally angry\u201d about the Civil War, which did not break out until 16 years after his death. And for good measure, Mr. Trump questioned \u201cwhy was there the Civil War\u201d in the first place, suggesting that it should have simply been worked out. The comments, made in an interview broadcast on Monday, may have been attributable to imprecision, but for historians they underscored what seems to be a tenuous understanding by Mr. Trump of the course of events that preceded his ascension to power. At various points, he has seemed to suggest that Frederick Douglass is still alive, appeared surprised that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, and mounted a plaque at a golf course marking a Civil War battle that never happened. \u201cPresidents should have some better sense of the nation\u2019s history as they become part of it,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton. White House officials said that Mr. Trump was being misinterpreted and that a few random comments had been twisted into meaning something they did not. The criticism of his remarks, they said, reflects a \u201cgotcha\u201d game by intellectual elitists who fail to understand him. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of hunting for \u2018what is it that Trump has done that\u2019s dumb?\u2019\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, who taught history as a college professor in Georgia and has written multiple historical novels. \u201cTrump\u2019s not a student of history. Trump\u2019s an extraordinarily successful, entrepreneurial personality who learns what he needs to know when he needs to know it. Trump is learning history as he governs.\u201d After Mr. Trump\u2019s comments led to criticism, he tried to clarify  Monday night on Twitter. \u201cPresident Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWould never have let it happen!\u201d Many presidents find history absorbing, since they live it and make it. President George W. Bush read 14 books about Lincoln during his time in office, seeking inspiration and comfort. President Barack Obama made a point of regularly hosting historians like Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robert A. Caro, David Kennedy and Robert Dallek for dinners examining how the travails of his predecessors offered lessons for his presidency. But even presidents with more evident interest have tripped up over history from time to time. Mr. Obama mangled World War II events when he said his great-uncle helped liberate Auschwitz, which would have been possible only if his great-uncle had been a Soviet soldier. Aides later clarified that Mr. Obama meant Buchenwald, which was liberated by American troops. Similarly, when Mr. Obama referred to \u201cPolish death camps,\u201d he generated a storm of protest in Warsaw, which always insists that they be referred to as German death camps on Polish territory. Mr. Trump has made questionable comments a regular feature of his public discourse, going back years. During the campaign, he talked about thousands of Muslims in the United States cheering after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, despite a lack of evidence. At a golf course in Virginia, he posted a plaque honoring the \u201cRiver of Blood\u201d where so many soldiers died in the Civil War that \u201cthe water would turn red,\u201d even though historians said no such battle took place there. At an African-American History Month celebration in February, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that the 19th-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass was still around. \u201cFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice,\u201d he said. At a later fund-raiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee, he seemed surprised that Lincoln belonged to the Republican Party. \u201cGreat president,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t even know he was a Republican, right? Does anyone know? Lot of people don\u2019t know that.\u201d No doubt many Americans are not fully aware of the country\u2019s history, but most do know Lincoln was a Republican, according to a Pew Research Center survey in 2012. Fifty-five percent of those polled correctly said Lincoln was a Republican. Still, perhaps Mr. Trump was thinking about the 28 percent who thought the Great Emancipator was a Democrat. Even his staff has found trouble over historically loose comments. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, asserted at a briefing that Hitler did not use chemical weapons against his own people. Mr. Spicer quickly apologized. \u201cTrump seems almost uniquely ill equipped to process history, whether because of his lack of empathy, his allergy to complexity, or his tendency to keep distant from anything that might carry the whiff of defeat,\u201d said Paul Starobin, author of the newly released \u201cMadness Rules the Hour,\u201d about the confrontation at Charleston, S.C., that led to the Civil War. \u201cHistory is not tidy. Trump likes tidy. He likes slogans. History doesn\u2019t offer any.\u201d The latest historical question mark came in an interview Mr. Trump gave to The Washington Examiner in which he discussed Andrew Jackson. Mr. Trump has embraced Jackson as a kindred populist spirit railing against the establishment ever since Mr. Gingrich and Stephen K. Bannon, now the president\u2019s chief strategist, told him of the similarities last year. Mr. Trump has hung a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office and visited his estate in Tennessee. \u201cI mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn\u2019t have had the Civil War,\u201d he told The Examiner. \u201cHe was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War; he said, \u2018There\u2019s no reason for this.\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump added: \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why? People don\u2019t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?\u201d While he demonstrated knowledge of other details of Jackson\u2019s life, the Civil War comments set off a wave of scorn online. \u201cPOTUS says that Andrew Jackson (who died in 1845) \u2018was really angry\u2019 about the Civil War,\u201d Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate last year, wrote on Twitter, using the initials for president of the United States. \u201cPaging the Department of Education \u2026\u201d John Weaver, a longtime adviser to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other politicians, mocked Mr. Trump with a reference to a supposed terrorist attack in Kentucky that one of his aides once cited erroneously. \u201cToo bad Pres. Jackson didn\u2019t ride up to Bowling Green/sit down with Frederick Douglass at besieged Nordstroms & figure out Civil War thingy,\u201d Mr. Weaver wrote. Jackson, a slave owner who believed in the use of force if necessary to preserve the Union, did not live to see the Civil War, but Mr. Trump may have been thinking of the Nullification Crisis of 1832-33, when Jackson threatened to send troops after South Carolina declared tariffs imposed by the federal government null and void and threatened to secede. That was a precursor, in a sense, to the crisis that precipitated the Civil War in 1861. \u201cThat\u2019s similar in vein to what one would say about the Civil War,\u201d said Michael Dubke, the White House communications director. \u201cI\u2019m sure something along those lines is what the president was referring to.\u201d Mr. Gingrich suggested that Mr. Trump was onto something in suggesting that Jackson would have been more suited to stopping the slide to war than James Buchanan, who was passive as Southern states seceded. \u201cCompare Jackson with Buchanan, and you could make a pretty good argument that had Jackson been president in 1856, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Civil War because he would have crushed it,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. Jon Meacham, a Jackson biographer, agreed that Mr. Trump probably meant the Nullification Crisis, but he said the question on what caused the Civil War suggested that Mr. Trump might have been referring to a deal to avert conflict short of the abolition of slavery. \u201cThe expansion of slavery caused the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. So what does Trump mean? Would he have let slavery exist but not expand? That\u2019s the counterfactual question you have to ask.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/us/politics/civil-war-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T03:30:29-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T03:30:29-04:00", "abstract": "The president\u2019s comments about the Civil War underscored what seems to be a tenuous understanding of the events that preceded his ascension to power.", "title": "With Civil War Remark, a President Who Doesn\u2019t Go by the (History) Book"}
