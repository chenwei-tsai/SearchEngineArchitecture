{"text": "On the first day of seventh grade last fall, Caitlin Dolan lined up for lunch at her school in Canonsburg, Pa. But when the cashier discovered she had an unpaid food bill from last year, the tray of pizza, cucumber slices, an apple and chocolate milk was thrown in the trash. \u201cI was so embarrassed,\u201d said Caitlin, who said other students had stared. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird being denied food in front of everyone. They all talk about you.\u201d Caitlin\u2019s mother, Merinda Durila, said that her daughter qualified for free lunch, but that a paperwork mix-up had created an outstanding balance. Ms. Durila said her child had come home in tears after being humiliated in front of her friends. Holding children publicly accountable for unpaid school lunch bills \u2014 by throwing away their food, providing a less desirable alternative lunch or branding them with markers \u2014 is often referred to as \u201clunch shaming.\u201d The practice is widespread \u2014 a 2014 report from the  Department of Agriculture found that nearly half of all districts used some form of shaming to compel parents to pay bills. (About 45 percent withheld the hot meal and gave a cold sandwich, while 3 percent denied food entirely.) A Pennsylvania cafeteria worker posted on Facebook that she had quit after being forced to take lunch from a child with an unpaid bill. In Alabama, a child was stamped on the arm with \u201cI Need Lunch Money.\u201d On one day, a Utah elementary school threw away the lunches of about 40 students with unpaid food bills. Hazel Compton, 12, remembers being given a sandwich of white bread with a slice of cheese instead of the hot lunch served to other children at her Albuquerque elementary school. (A school district spokeswoman said the sandwich met federal requirements.) \u201cThey would use the sandwich like a threat,\u201d Hazel recalled. \u201cLike, \u2018If you don\u2019t want it, your parents have to pay.\u2019\u201d Oliver Jane, 15, said that when she had meal debt at Shawnee Heights High School in Tecumseh, Kan., she was told to return her tray of hot food and was given a cold sandwich instead. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t eat the lunch, they were just going to throw it away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems unfair to me to expect a bunch of kids to be responsible for putting money in their lunch accounts when they don\u2019t even handle their own funds.\u201d Marty Stessman, superintendent of the Shawnee Heights Unified School District, said that younger children were allowed to take a limited number of meals despite debt, but that high school students were not. \u201cNotices are sent home automatically when they go below $5, so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise,\u201d Dr. Stessman said. \u201cThey should know before they get to the cashier.\u201d The problem of meal debt is not new, but the issue has received more attention recently because the Department of Agriculture, which oversees school lunch programs, imposed a July 1 deadline for states to establish policies on how to treat children who cannot pay for food. \u201cIt has been a longstanding issue in schools, one that\u2019s gone on for decades,\u201d said Kevin W. Concannon, who was the department\u2019s under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services in the Obama administration. After a 2010 overhaul of school nutrition standards, the department heard from schools and advocacy groups about the burden of lunch debt and the shaming practices that often result. Last summer, the Agriculture Department concluded that meal debt should be managed locally, but required states to formalize their debt policies. \u201cWe\u2019re not telling schools what to put in their policy, but we do want them to think about the issue,\u201d said Tina Namian, who oversees the school meals policy branch.\u201d The department does not prohibit practices that stigmatize children with meal debt, but offers a list of \u201cpreferred alternatives,\u201d such as working out payment plans and allowing children with unpaid balances to eat the regular hot meal. In March, New Mexico passed a law that directs schools to work with parents to pay debts and ends practices like cold sandwich substitutes that may embarrass children. \u201cOur biggest hope for this bill is that no student will have to contemplate what meal they are going to get,\u201d said Monica Armenta, a spokeswoman for Albuquerque Public Schools, where Hazel Compton was given a cheese sandwich. Minnesota and the San Francisco Unified School District, among others, also have adopted anti-shaming policies. Recently, the Houston Independent School District notified its food service department that children with debt should be served the regular hot meal. \u201cThis is fundamentally a right-versus-wrong decision,\u201d said Brian Busby, the chief operating officer for Houston schools. \u201cIf a kid needs a meal, he\u2019s going to eat.\u201d But feeding hungry children whose families have meal debt does not solve the problem for schools, which still must grapple with paying the bill. In 2016, the School Nutrition Association published a review of almost 1,000 school lunch programs, finding that nearly 75 percent of districts had unpaid meal debt. One solution is the federal free meal program. But not every struggling family meets the income requirements, and those that do may have language barriers or fears over immigration status, or fail to file the paperwork. An Agriculture Department guidance document suggests that districts reach out to the community for help, for example through \u201crandom acts of kindness\u201d funding and school fund-raisers. Such efforts around the country have begun to help some districts solve the problem. In 2014, when a theater technician, Kenny Thompson, was mentoring fourth graders in the Houston suburb of Spring Branch, he saw a cafeteria worker refuse to serve a child the hot meal of chicken, potatoes, fruit and milk. \u201cThe lunch lady says: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I told you yesterday you couldn\u2019t have this today. You need to tell your parents to pay their bill.\u2019 And then she turns around and gives him two slices of bread with cold cheese,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. He knew the child\u2019s mother was in the hospital, and he stepped in to pay the bill. Later, Mr. Thompson started Feed the Future Forward, which has hosted crawfish boils and charity golf tournaments to raise money for lunch debt. It has wiped out more than $30,000 in food bills and is planning an additonal $23,000 in donations. The giving comes with a catch: Schools must promise they will not give alternative meals to children with unpaid bills. Spring Branch, where Mr. Thompson first witnessed the practice, has taken the pledge. Rob Solomon, chief executive of GoFundMe, said it had about 30 active campaigns to raise money for meal debt. Camille Billing, a teacher in Hamilton, N.J., recently started a GoFundMe page. In Galveston, Tex., a retired teacher, Donna Woods-Stellman, paid off the city\u2019s meal debt after raising $1,000. A YouCaring page has raised more than $6,000 for students at impoverished high schools in Virginia. In West Palm Beach, Fla., two high school juniors started  School Lunch Fairy to help erase lunch debts. While the efforts are laudable, \u201cthey should be a last resort,\u201d said Abby J. Leibman, president and chief executive of Mazon, a Jewish anti-hunger organization. Others argue that school meals should be offered free to all children, regardless of income, as is the case in Sweden and Brazil. \u201cWe need to provide school meals on the same basis on which we provide school transportation and textbooks,\u201d said Janet Poppendieck, a senior fellow at the CUNY Urban Food Policy Institute and author of \u201cFree for All: Fixing School Food in America.\u201d Some cities, including Boston, Chicago and Detroit, offer free meals to all students under the Community Eligibility Provision, a federal regulation that allows districts in high-poverty areas to do so regardless of individual need. In New York City, a pilot free lunch program is under review. Most schools in the United States, however, do not qualify for the provision, and only about half of those that do take advantage of it. As a result, districts struggling with unpaid lunch bills, which can run into the millions in large urban areas, often resort to shaming tactics to push parents to pay the debt. Crystal Jarek, a retired teacher in Lee County, Fla., said she remembered the staff taking debt notices to class. \u201cThe cafeteria staff would come in at noon, wearing their hairnets, and hand out letters,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the kids would turn around to see who was getting one.\u201d During the 2015-16 school year, Lee County began offering free meals for all students at 76 of its schools, including the one where Ms. Jarek taught. Kerry Krepps, a retiree in Kansas City, Mo., has seen the lasting effects of lunch shaming. Her adult son refuses to eat peanut butter because it reminds him of middle school in western Minneapolis, when students with debt were sent to a table to make peanut butter sandwiches. \u201cThe humiliation has persisted for 20 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows how lasting these experiences can be.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/well/family/lunch-shaming-children-parents-school-bills.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Well", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T20:52:08-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T20:52:08-04:00", "abstract": "As school districts struggle under the burden of unpaid lunch debt, many of them resort to tactics that stigmatize children.", "title": "Shaming Children So Parents Will Pay the School Lunch Bill"}
