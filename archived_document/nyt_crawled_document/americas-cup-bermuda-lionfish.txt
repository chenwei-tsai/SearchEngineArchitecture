Make a breakthrough in design \u2014 be it a winged keel or, in this era of hydrofoiling, a better daggerboard \u2014 and your chances of securing the oldest major trophy in sports increase considerably. But the Cup\u2019s arrival in Bermuda, the British territory in the North Atlantic where the competition will begin next month, has also been a catalyst to help solve an altogether different type of technological challenge. Bermuda has a growing problem with the lionfish, a spiny and voracious invasive species with no natural predators that is a threat to its native fish and the health of its coral reefs. The British America\u2019s Cup team, Land Rover BAR, and its sustainability sponsor, 11th Hour Racing, are intent on leaving a legacy in Bermuda and have made the lionfish a priority. Ben Ainslie, Land Rover BAR\u2019s founder and skipper, has made sustainability part of the conversation in this edition of the Cup. Last year, he was a driving force in persuading all the teams to sign a sustainability charter that committed them to eliminating single-use plastics, avoiding water pollution, reusing materials and protecting marine habitats. \u201cMy wife, Georgie, and I are good friends of Richard Branson\u2019s, and we have been to stay with him on Necker Island a few times,\u201d said Ainslie, a four-time Olympic gold medalist and the biggest star in British sailing. \u201cBeing there in the Caribbean and here in Bermuda and talking to the locals, you realize the extent of the lionfish issue, and the potential devastation it could cause,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s something they are really, really concerned about.\u201d This week, a small group of scientists and conservationists, with the financial and promotional help of Land Rover BAR, is deploying a robot prototype in Bermuda designed to stun and capture lionfish at depths that human divers rarely reach. \u201cIt\u2019s an inventive way to try and tackle this issue,\u201d Ainslie said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to get developed over time, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make it work.\u201d The robot is the brainchild of a new organization, Robots in Service of the Environment, which was founded in 2015 by Colin Angle and his wife, Erika. Colin Angle is the chief executive and co-founder of iRobot, whose products include the robot vacuum Roomba and the bomb-disarming PackBot. Avid divers, the Angles founded Robots in Service of the Environment, known as RSE (pronounced rise), after a trip to Bermuda. Native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the lionfish, which reproduces at a rapid rate, has been colonizing the Caribbean and Atlantic. With its protruding spines and distinctive coloration, it is a popular aquarium fish and was possibly released \u2014 intentionally or unintentionally \u2014 into United States coastal waters. The Bermuda robot is RSE\u2019s first initiative. Wendy Schmidt, a co-founder of 11th Hour Racing, has helped fund the project through Schmidt Marine Technology Partners, and Ainslie\u2019s team has helped promote it. \u201cIt certainly wouldn\u2019t have happened as quickly without the America\u2019s Cup, because we are a volunteer organization and we count on contributions from the community,\u201d Orin Hoffman, RSE\u2019s chief roboticist, said last week in Boston before heading to Bermuda. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of attention on Bermuda right now because of the Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see these beautiful boats sailing around Bermuda, and underneath them there\u2019s this pretty horrific environmental catastrophe underway with this lionfish invasion, so I think it brings the community of people who are passionate about the ocean together.\u201d The long-term goal is to control the lionfish by making it a popular seafood choice. That will require the involvement of commercial fishermen. \u201cBelow recreational dive depths there are still enormous populations of lionfish, and some biologists believe they are doing most of their breeding at depths below the typical 90 feet that recreational divers swim at,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cSo the goal is to have our robot go down to 400 feet and be easy to use so commercial fishermen can efficiently use it. \u201cIn order to do that,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe need to make it low cost, so we\u2019re targeting $1,000 or under. That\u2019s a really hard problem.\u201d To promote lionfish consumption, Land Rover BAR and the five other America\u2019s Cup teams will take part in a cook-off Wednesday night at the National Museum of Bermuda, where leading chefs representing each team will compete to prepare the best lionfish dish. Ainslie and the other skippers will be the judges. Participants include Chris Kenny, the head chef on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands, and Rob Ruiz, the chef and owner of the Land and Water Company in Carlsbad, Calif., and a leading voice for responsibly sourced seafood. \u201cWe humans have created this lionfish problem for ourselves, so now our hope is that we can eat our way out of it,\u201d Ruiz said by telephone last week from San Diego. \u201cLionfish are delicious, and they are nutritious. It\u2019s a slightly sweet, white, flaky and versatile fish that can be utilized like a pollock or a snapper.\u201d Ruiz sees developing a large commercial market for the species as a rare win-win (unless you\u2019re a lionfish). \u201cAll of our main fishing stocks right now are in critical condition, so this is a brilliant way to alleviate stress on all of the other species that we are targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s a very beautiful creature we can capture and make a positive impact.\u201d The lionfish is increasingly on the menu in restaurants in the United States and the Caribbean, but Ruiz said there was not yet a supply large or consistent enough to create a reliable market. The fact that lionfish spines are poisonous could dissuade some diners, but Ruiz said they were easily snipped off after capture. As a rock dweller that does not school in large numbers, the lionfish is impractical to catch by net. Spearfishing is the typical collection method, but RSE\u2019s new robot could change that. The robot is being developed by a team of volunteers, including biologists, that is working out of the Boston garage of John Rizzi, RSE\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of moved in,\u201d Hoffman of RSE said with a laugh. \u201cWe work in folks\u2019 backyards; we\u2019ve had water tanks in, you know, questionable spots. This is a pretty classic start-up technology story. But instead of looking for an I.P.O., we are looking just to raise enough funding for us to get robots out there to make an impact.\u201d The robot is about three and a half feet long and about 20 pounds, Hoffman said. It is equipped with a camera and controlled by a digital tablet operated at the surface. The robot is designed for now to collect up to 10 lionfish on each dive and does so by stunning the fish with a charge generated by two 14-inch, low-voltage electrical probes. \u201cBasically the strategy is to take advantage of the fact that lionfish have no known predators, so they stay relatively stationary underwater, even when the robot approaches,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cSo we stun the fish, then suck the fish up into a collection tube and repeat.\u201d Schmidt said the ability to distribute the robot and the development of a fishery in Bermuda would be important to the success of her team\u2019s efforts. \u201cI would count those as big wins if we can be a catalyst towards that kind of outcome,\u201d she said, \u201cand obviously if Ben and his team win the America\u2019s Cup, they get an even bigger platform for their messaging.\u201d", "abstract": "On the sidelines of the sailing race off Bermuda, one team and its partners are backing tests of a new way to capture a destructive nonnative species.", "section": "Sports", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/sports/sailing/americas-cup-bermuda-lionfish.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "In America\u2019s Cup Waters, a Robot Takes On an Invasion of Lionfish", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T20:12:12-04:00"}
