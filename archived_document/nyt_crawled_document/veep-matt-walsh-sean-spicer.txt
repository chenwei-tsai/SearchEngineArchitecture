{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Mike McLintock, who has experience as the White House press secretary on the HBO show \u201cVeep,\u201d knows a thing or two about handling the White House press corps and is no stranger to foot-in-mouth moments. The actor behind the character, Matt Walsh, was in Washington on Friday meeting with lawmakers about the National Endowment for the Arts. He talked with Julie Hirschfeld Davis, a White House correspondent for The New York Times, about what advice the on-screen spokesman would have for the man who holds the job in real life, Sean Spicer. The McLintock character made an appearance during the interview. When asked about the rumors that he might be fired by Selina Meyer, who (briefly) reached the presidency, he quickly dismissed the possibility. \u201cThese are stories that come up for every press secretary, and I\u2019m as secure as anyone in Selina\u2019s administration,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, no, there\u2019s no truth to that rumor. And this is actually a waste of time to ask that question.\u201d To watch the full interview, visit facebook.com/nytimes.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/arts/television/veep-matt-walsh-sean-spicer.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T18:24:15-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T18:17:45-04:00", "abstract": "Matt Walsh, who has portrayed the gaffe-prone White House press secretary on HBO, has some advice for Sean Spicer, the man who holds the job in real life.", "title": "What Mike McLintock From \u2018Veep\u2019 Would Say to Sean Spicer"}
