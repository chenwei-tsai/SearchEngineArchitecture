{"text": "Humpback whales have been dying in extraordinary numbers along the Eastern Seaboard since the beginning of last year. Marine biologists have a term for it \u2014 an \u201cunusual mortality event\u201d \u2014 but they have no firm idea why it is happening. Forty-one whales have died in the past 15 months along the Atlantic coast from North Carolina to Maine. In a news conference on Thursday, officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries said that they had not identified the underlying reason for the mass death, but that 10 of the whales are known to have been killed by collisions with ships. The agency is starting a broad inquiry into the deaths. These whales \u201chave evidence of blunt force trauma, or large propeller cuts,\u201d said Deborah Fauquier, a veterinary medical officer at the agency\u2019s Office of Protected Resources. These collisions with ships were \u201cacute events,\u201d Dr. Fauquier said, and were being treated as the \u201cproximate cause of death.\u201d Dr. Fauquier said that the number of whale strandings was \u201calarming,\u201d and that she hoped the investigation might give a sense of what kind of threat this presents to this population of humpback whales and those around the world. On average, eight humpback whales are stranded each year from Maine to Virginia, and fewer than two are hit by ships, according to data from NOAA. An unusual mortality event is a specific designation under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and is defined as \u201ca stranding that is unexpected, involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population, and demands immediate response.\u201d Whale or other marine mammal die-offs are often poorly understood by scientists, and this case is no exception. Officials from NOAA Fisheries could not explain why the animals were coming into greater contact with vessels, or if there were any human-caused or climate-related disturbances that had changed their behavior. Gregory Silber, marine resources manager in the agency\u2019s Office of Protected Resources, said that there had not been any increase in ship traffic in the region, and that the whales might be following their prey \u2014 they mostly eat krill and small fish \u2014 to areas where there could be more shipping. Ten whales other than those killed by ships have been examined, but officials have not yet determined the cause of death. There is no indication that they were killed by disease. Humpback whales, which can be as long as 60 feet, weigh as much as 40 tons and can live for 50 years, are found in all of the world\u2019s oceans. There are 14 distinct population segments \u2014 groups that follow certain migration and breeding patterns \u2014 of humpback whales, some of which are classified as endangered or threatened. The population along the Atlantic coast, which winters in the Caribbean and summers in the North Atlantic or Arctic regions, is considered \u201cthreatened\u201d by NOAA, meaning that while it is not endangered now, it could become endangered in the near future. Around the world, there are an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 humpback whales \u2014 about a third of its original population. The Atlantic population is around 10,000. Scientists have suggested that some whale deaths could be a result of marine noise, often a result of military activity, offshore drilling or exploration, which can disorient the animals and send them in the wrong direction, possibly toward beaches where they get stuck instead of into the deeper ocean. Mr. Silber, the NOAA manager, said he was not aware of a connection between ocean noise and these strandings. A recent study has shown that dolphins, when escaping predators or the source of marine noise, might shoot up from a dive more quickly than they otherwise would, switching from slow, deliberate strokes to faster, longer ones, which can cause them to use double the energy they normally do, and exhaust them. The last major mass casualty event for marine mammals in this part of the world took place from 2013 to 2015, when a resurgence of the morbillivirus killed thousands of bottlenose dolphins on the Eastern Seaboard. Among humpback whales, there was an unusual mortality event in 2006, following others in 2005, which involved other large whales, and 2003, which was primarily humpback whales. In each investigation, the cause was undetermined, officials said. NOAA officials said that members of the public looking to help with the investigation could report stranded or dead floating whales to numbers listed on their website.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/climate/whales-atlantic-mass-dieoff-noaa.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Climate", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T13:54:18-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T13:53:25-04:00", "abstract": "Officials are seeking the reason for an \u201cunusual mortality event\u201d that has left 41 humpback whales dead since early 2016 from North Carolina to Maine.", "title": "NOAA Is Investigating Mass Die-Off of Whales in the Atlantic"}
