If you\u2019ve been a workaholic your whole life, you can\u2019t enjoy retirement. What are you supposed to do with yourself? Gwyneth Horder-Payton, who directed the episode, opens with a haunting and beautifully constructed montage of Crawford\u2019s life after she moved to Manhattan. Her apartment is immaculate, decorated in shades of puce and lemon-yellow. She is amazed by her microwave. She gets a small dog. She sits on her plastic-covered couch, watching scenes from the Vietnam War on television. In an echo from \u201cBaby Jane,\u201d there\u2019s a beautiful moment when she comes across one of her movies on television. Lange\u2019s face melts into soft affection and gratitude that somewhere out there people have not forgotten her. The sequence goes on for some time, one evocative fragment after another, a poignant portrait of a woman slowly turning into a ghost. When Crawford\u2019s agent comes to her with an offer for a low-budget film called \u201cThe Missing Link,\u201d her face lights up. Work! (This film was Crawford\u2019s last.) The film\u2019s name was changed to \u201cTrog,\u201d short for \u201ctroglodyte,\u201d and it was so low-budget that Crawford\u2019s \u201cdressing room\u201d was a battered Volkswagen van. But there is gallantry in her commitment to such schlocky material. Crawford published a book in 1971 called \u201cMy Way of Life,\u201d in which she dispensed advice on fashion, home d\u00e9cor and style. (It\u2019s a truly nutty book, Crawford breezily advising at one point, \u201cA red vegetable next to a yellow one looks unappetizing.\u201d) But she\u2019s ill. She spits blood into the sink. She refuses to admit she\u2019s dying. Mamacita returns to take care of her part-time. As the sun begins to set on Crawford, Davis continues her own fight. She throws herself into filming television pilots that may or may not get picked up. She stars with Faye Dunaway in a 1973 television movie called \u201cThe Disappearance of Aimee.\u201d Davis\u2019s feelings about Dunaway make the feud with Crawford look like child\u2019s play. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know true hatred until she met Faye,\u201d says Victor Buono in another of the show\u2019s flashes forward to 1978. There\u2019s a vicious scene between Davis and B.D., in which B.D. accuses her mother of being a drunk, which Davis denies (\u201cYou\u2019re drinking a margarita, Mother,\u201d B.D. snaps. \u201cAt 11 a.m.\u201d) Worse, she tells her mother that she will only be allowed to see her and Jeremy\u2019s children under supervision. The centerpiece of the episode is a dream sequence in which Crawford, near the end of her life, dying, wanders through her apartment at night, hair long and gray. She enters her living room, finding Jack Warner and Hedda Hopper sitting at a table, playing cards, reminiscing and roaring with laughter. They look as vivid as gems against black velvet. Crawford joins them, and suddenly she is herself again, black hair piled high, stunning red dress. She laughs at Warner\u2019s jokes, but then she admits, frightened, almost mad, \u201cI don\u2019t know who I am when I\u2019m by myself.\u201d Suddenly Davis appears, and \u2014 across the table \u2014 there is a meaningful exchange of acknowledgment, forgiveness and understanding. Mamacita interrupts the hallucination and gently brings the disoriented Crawford back to bed. It\u2019s a bold choice. It\u2019s what creator Ryan Murphy clearly wishes had happened. I have resisted some of the show\u2019s more plainly stated themes about the importance of sisterhood, but this scene unleashed a torrent of emotion. \u201cFeud,\u201d with all its style and panache, is personal filmmaking. And if the creator\u2019s vision is executed with clarity of purpose and intent, that vision beckons you to enter, even if you have ambivalence about some of it. Crawford and Davis were not oil and water. More accurate, they were steel and flint, creating sparks, starting fires. Dan Callahan, in his recap of Episode 7 for Nylon, suggests: \u201cSome women and some men are natural enemies, and some hatreds can be as stimulating and enjoyable and productive as love affairs. You don\u2019t hate someone without some kind of intense, thwarted love lurking somewhere as a flip side to that emotion.\u201d But Murphy, a romantic at heart, seems to mourn the fact that the two women couldn\u2019t (or wouldn\u2019t) bury the hatchet, and that mournful emotion keens through the finale. \u201cFeud\u201d has had a very strong point of view. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t, but it gives an audience so much to chew on, confront, discover. Murphy doesn\u2019t play it safe. Davis and Crawford didn\u2019t play it safe. And in the series\u2019s melodramatic, emotional and spikily funny atmosphere, Murphy has given Lange, Sarandon and the rest of the cast an enormous space in which to operate. The series lets the two historical women at its center be as complex as they really were. It lets them be obnoxious, irritating, grandiose, unsympathetic. It lets them be human. Most important, a passionate affection for Davis and Crawford is the churning engine of the whole thing. Late in the finale, shortly after Crawford dies, Davis, Olivia de Havilland and Joan Blondell stand backstage at the Oscars ceremony, watching the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d tribute on the monitor. For a moment, Crawford\u2019s face appears, and it\u2019s as though the air is suddenly sucked out of the room. Someone remarks sadly that this was a woman who had been in films for four decades, and \u201ctwo seconds was all she got.\u201d Davis snaps, tough as nails but clearly stamping down her own overwhelming emotion, \u201cTwo seconds is all we\u2019ll all get.\u201d In the end, \u201cFeud\u201d says something quite old-fashioned, but no less essential. It says: Honor your elders. Listen to them when they tell you what it was like for them. Care about their stories. Recognize that you have benefited from their fights for change. There is still a lot of hard work to be done. And watch the films of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Watch Davis in \u201cThe Letter,\u201d \u201cMr. Skeffington,\u201d \u201cNow, Voyager,\u201d \u201cJezebel\u201d and \u201cOf Human Bondage.\u201d Watch Crawford in \u201cGrand Hotel,\u201d \u201cThe Women,\u201d \u201cMildred Pierce,\u201d \u201cSudden Fear\u201d and \u201cHarriet Craig.\u201d Their true legacies are there.", "abstract": "In the end, the show said something quite old-fashioned, but no less essential."}
