Bodysurfing is generally benign, but even experienced watermen like Hopkins can be surprised once in a while. When a wave caught him unprepared, his board slipped and smacked him in the face. Hopkins did not sleep well that night, or the following night. He visited a chiropractor. But it was not until several days later, pain still lingering, that he agreed to a magnetic resonance imaging test. The revelation was chilling: He had fractured the C2 vertebra in his neck. On went a neck brace, which Hopkins wore throughout the fall until Nov. 19, two weeks before he assumed command of the Orange while Boeheim served a nine-game suspension for his program\u2019s infractions of N.C.A.A. rules. Syracuse lost five of those games. The effect of those losses amounted to another wave blindsiding Hopkins \u2014 this one even more forceful, at least emotionally, than the last. The Orange recovered, winning eight of their first 10 games with Boeheim back, inching into the mix in the Atlantic Coast Conference, sneaking into the N.C.A.A. tournament, and soaring into their second Final Four in four years, where they will face North Carolina on Saturday. Hopkins, who has been an unshakable steward to Boeheim\u2019s program for over two decades, is respected in coaching circles and is as strongly wedded to the Syracuse ideology as anyone. He has had a more difficult time than the team in grappling with that 4-5 record tied to his name. It was a seminal period for the team, which has pointed back to those games as a trial that brought the locker room closer together, helped forge its identity and sharpened its focus. Alternatively, it was a humbling and tormenting month for Hopkins, who said in a telephone interview this week that his emotions related to the effort to \u201cprotect\u201d his beloved program in Boeheim\u2019s stead remained difficult to express. \u201cPeople wanted me to talk about this, and I kind of wanted to stay away from it,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be about me, because it\u2019s not.\u201d Hopkins added, \u201cThe biggest takeaway is\u201d \u2014 he sighed, pausing for several seconds \u2014 \u201cthere are about a thousand.\u201d After gathering his thoughts, Hopkins said, \u201cUntil you sit there, there is so much to learn.\u201d In two years, Hopkins will sit there; that much is clear. Boeheim announced in March 2015 that he planned to retire after the 2017-18 season \u2014 his 42nd at the helm \u2014 and he said again this week that he intended to honor that pledge. Hopkins, who was first publicly named as Boeheim\u2019s successor in 2007, was officially designated as such in June by Kent Syverud, Syracuse\u2019s chancellor, if only because almost a decade had passed. Hopkins has flirted with leaving on multiple occasions \u2014 he has been considered for openings at Charlotte, St. Bonaventure, Boston College and Southern California, among others \u2014 but has always returned. He has been the team\u2019s senior staff member since Bernie Fine was fired in 2011, and he joined Boeheim and U.S.A. Basketball for the 2012 London Olympics. Boeheim said Friday that Hopkins was \u201cmuch more prepared than I was to be a head coach.\u201d \u201cMike has proven to me over and over again that he understands the game, the players, the other things that surround what a head coach has to do,\u201d Boeheim said. So when the N.C.A.A. held up Boeheim\u2019s suspension on appeal, forcing him to go on \u201cvacation\u201d \u2014 Boeheim\u2019s term \u2014 in early December, the Orange\u2019s interim coach seemed well prepared to handle the job. Only, Hopkins says now, he was not. How could that be? For one, there was the sudden amplifying of focus, from the tasks he is responsible for as an assistant to myriad others as head coach. Suddenly, wave after wave was smacking him all over again. Sleepless nights followed. Hopkins lost his appetite, narrowing an already angular figure. Hopkins kept running the same plays, the same rotations, the same drills as Boeheim. But his best attempt at mimicry could not produce the same winning results. In so trying, he learned valuable lessons. \u201cThe nine games helped me immensely,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity I would never give back. If I had to do it all again, I would do it all again. If I had won the nine games, I don\u2019t think I would have learned as much as I did. It was a priceless opportunity. Priceless.\u201d When Hopkins arrived at Syracuse from Southern California in 1989, all elbows and knees, and still kicking the beach sand out of his sneakers, it seemed an odd pairing of player and program. Tim Welsh, then an assistant for the Orange, had no idea who the sandy-blond Hopkins was when he walked into the gym. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was going to last two years,\u201d Welsh said. Adrian Autry, one of Hopkins\u2019s teammates, said the adjustment might not have been easy, but the scrawny Hopkins eventually became a team captain. \u201cI never looked at him as someone that would run from a challenge,\u201d said Autry, now another of Syracuse\u2019s assistants. But when Hopkins\u2019s playing career with the Orange ended in 1993, he had no desire to coach. He intended to take a job with his father\u2019s manufacturing business, Paper Pak Industries. As it happened, that year had been hard on the company, and Hopkins had to reconsider his decision. He started assisting a sixth-grade boys\u2019 Amateur Athletic Union program. \u201cThere was nothing like the feeling of helping somebody get better,\u201d Hopkins said. In 1995, a spot opened up on Syracuse\u2019s bench, and he called Boeheim, who invited him to return. Syracuse, it seems, is a difficult place to leave. Boeheim has never done it, and the team\u2019s video coordinator, Todd Blumen, has been there since 1986; the trainer, Brad Pike, since 2000; the strength coach, Ryan Cabiles, since 2007. The team\u2019s two other assistants, Autry and Gerry McNamara, are former Syracuse players. But Hopkins\u2019s loyalty verges on obsession. On social media, he posts pictures of orange sunrises and lake-effect snowfall. When Hopkins went trick-or-treating on Halloween with his three children, he dressed as a Stormtrooper from Star Wars, with an orange ray gun. His sunny demeanor and high-energy persona can seem antithetical to Boeheim\u2019s, who admitted as much. \u201cHe\u2019s much better than I am with the media,\u201d Boeheim said, \u201cwhich probably isn\u2019t hard.\u201d But on the sideline, they are in lock step. Boeheim said he had always believed that teams were better off when they hired from within, and he has groomed Hopkins for 20 years. As for the nine games, \u201cyou can\u2019t coach somebody else\u2019s team,\u201d Boeheim said. Hopkins does not want to make any excuses. For 21 years, it has been his team, too. \u201cThe way that I am is I\u2019m striving for perfection,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cYou\u2019re up all night thinking what you should have done differently. That\u2019s how I was as a player. I take every experience and try to get better from it.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T04:00:12-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/sports/ncaabasketball/mike-hopkins-boeheims-successor-is-learning-to-ride-waves-as-head-coach.html", "item_type": "Article"}
