{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 In a corner of this city where stores burned, and rocks flew through windows, I found a garden growing. \u201cIt\u2019s the heat that makes them grow,\u201d Rafael Martinez, 79, told me as he stood over a patch of chamomile bushes in a community garden underneath power transmission lines in the Watts neighborhood of South Los Angeles. Days of constant California spring sunshine had produced thousands of tiny white flowers with yellow pistils. Upheavals of looting and arson swept through South Los Angeles twice in the second half of the 20th century, in 1965 and 1992. Today, squash, alfalfa and a leafy Mexican vegetable called quelite grow just 500 feet from where the 1965 Watts riots started in reaction to police brutality against black and Latino residents. Mr. Martinez, a retired factory worker with roots in Mexico, finds peace and a sense of purpose there. When he steps away from the garden, however, things don\u2019t look so wonderful. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to make ends meet here,\u201d he said in Spanish. Thanks to Southern California\u2019s crazy real estate market, a three-bedroom house in Watts can go for more than $300,000. \u201cI used to spend $5 and get a bag of groceries to feed my family. Now $5 doesn\u2019t buy you anything.\u201d Twenty-five years ago this month, after the second riot struck on April 29, I heard people in South Los Angeles express the economic frustrations of an earlier era. \u201cIt\u2019s not a recession for minority communities,\u201d one African-American resident told me that day. \u201cIt\u2019s a depression.\u201d Down the street from her home, columns of smoke rose from torched liquor stores. The 1992 riot, or \u201cuprising,\u201d as it\u2019s often called here, was set off by the acquittal of four officers charged in the videotaped police beating of Rodney King. As a reporter for The Los Angeles Times, I drove across the city, following the multiethnic frenzy of violence as it spread across my hometown from South Los Angeles to the Hollywood neighborhood where I was born and raised. With those horrible days only a memory, South Los Angeles can look and feel like a poor man\u2019s Eden. Over the decades, many different kinds of people have built lives there: families escaping the oppression of the Ottoman Empire, the racism of the Jim Crow South, and the poverty of Mexico and Central America. The avocado trees, rose bushes and nopal cactuses they\u2019ve planted still rise, bloom and give fruit in the front yards. But South Los Angeles is also a place of hurt, confusion and rage, where life is harsh. At the flash point of the 1965 riots, the only historical marker I found didn\u2019t commemorate that event at all, but rather the 2001 killing of a school crossing guard in a drive-by shooting. Most of the big auto and tire plants that circled the community closed long ago, and parts of the neighborhood look like a sun-drenched Rust Belt with sea breezes, where sea gulls eat from overflowing trash bins. \u201cRiot is the voice of the unheard,\u201d an African-American leader said in the days after the 1992 conflagration. I understand such sentiments, but up close, a mob is an ugly thing to see, its actions pointless. People take things that don\u2019t belong to them. They beat up the weak and defenseless. Today, Latino and black officers together make up a majority of a much-reformed Los Angeles Police Department. A quarter-century on, the people who live here are not about to riot. But many feel that their voices are as unheard as ever \u2014 and thousands of South Los Angeles immigrants face a cruel, arbitrary power of another kind: federal agents carrying out the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policies of deporting the undocumented. \u201cWhat do you say to the immigrant families?\u201d a young Latina asked me when I visited students at Locke High School in Watts this month. \u201cDoes this country still want them?\u201d she wanted to know. \u201cDo they still have a future here?\u201d The answer I had to offer students like her was that they should have faith in their own abilities to transform Los Angeles and the United States into better places to live. And they had already started. With the help of 826LA, a nonprofit group focusing on youth literacy, Locke students had just written a book about the legacy of the 1992 riots, an event that unfolded before they were born. They interviewed black, Latino and Korean-American residents about that experience, and offered their own descriptions of daily life in one of the city\u2019s toughest neighborhoods. \u201cI don\u2019t think people understand what it feels like to move from hell to a place in between,\u201d writes one of the students, Jonathan Lopez, a Salvadoran immigrant, \u201cbecause for me L.A. isn\u2019t heaven, but it\u2019s also not hell.\u201d For another student, Alejandra Vasquez, finding a home in South Los Angeles after journeying from El Salvador also meant being reunited with her father after nine years of separation. \u201cNobody says the way is easy, that we would never have problems,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut behind all this there is something good, a better life.\u201d She takes solace, she said, in a saying her mother repeats often: \u201cThere is always calm after a storm.\u201d In South Los Angeles, there is calm, an uneasy one given the ever-present threat of gun violence and rumors of immigration roundups and raids. The city will not be consumed in flames again soon, but like other troubled parts of the United States, it burns a little every day. It smolders with seething resentments. The people there know they deserve better, but their most common act of resistance is simply to work hard, plant gardens and watch them grow.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/south-la-revisited-25-years-after-the-rodney-king-riots.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T21:56:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-04-28T21:56:24-04:00", "abstract": "The unrest I reported on in 1992 is a distant memory.
