{"text": "LIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Pedro\u2019s sublime goal helped move Chelsea a step closer to the Premier League title as the ruthless leaders swept to a 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday. Chelsea had to work hard to break down Everton\u2019s stubborn resistence, but Pedro\u2019s majestic second-half goal put the Blues on course for a fourth win in five games. Late goals from Gary Cahill and Willian wrapped up the victory as the Blues opened a seven-point lead at the top of the standings, piling pressure on second-place Tottenham ahead of its North London Derby against Arsenal later Sunday. Regardless of the result at White Hart Lane, Chelsea\u2019s steely display ensured the destiny of the title remains in its hands with four matches left: against Middlesbrough, West Bromwich Albion, Watford and Sunderland. Only West Brom, currently eighth, is in the top half of the league table. Chelsea need nine points to be assured of being crowned English champions in Manager Antonio Conte\u2019s first season in charge. Restoring Pedro to the starting lineup Sunday in place of Cesc F\u00e0bregas, Conte put the emphasis on attack, but the leaders were nearly caught cold at the back in the opening minutes. Dominic Calvert-Lewin wriggled free for a shot from a tight angle that deflected onto a post and rebounded to Romelu Lukaku, whose close-range strike was goalbound until Cahill came to the rescue with a last-ditch block. Chelsea squandered a chance to take the lead when Diego Costa scampered away from the Everton defence and picked out Eden Hazard\u2019s run.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/sports/soccer/chelsea-beats-everton-premier-league.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T11:39:02-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T11:39:02-04:00", "abstract": "A 3-0 win extended the Blues\u2019 advantage over second-place Tottenham, which faced Arsenal later Sunday, to seven points with four games to play.", "title": "Chelsea Beats Everton to Move Closer to Premier League Title"}
