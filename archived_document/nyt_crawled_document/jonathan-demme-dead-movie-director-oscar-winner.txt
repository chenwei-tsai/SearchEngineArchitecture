He was 73. His publicist, Leslee Dart, confirmed the death. Mr. Demme disclosed that he had cancer in 2015. Mob wives, CB radio buffs and AIDS victims; Hannibal Lecter, Howard Hughes and Jimmy Carter: Mr. Demme (pronounced DEM-ee) plucked his subjects and stories largely from the stew of contemporary American subcultures and iconography. He created a body of work \u2014 including fiction films and documentaries, dramas and comedies, original scripts, adaptations and remakes \u2014 that resists easy characterization. A personable man with the curiosity gene and the what-comes-next instinct of someone who likes to both hear and tell stories, Mr. Demme had a good one of his own, a Mr. Deeds kind of tale in which he wandered into good fortune and took advantage of it. A former movie publicist, he had an apprenticeship in low-budget B-movies with the producer Roger Corman before turning director. Mr. Demme became known early in his career for quirky social satires that led critics to compare him to Preston Sturges. They included \u201cHandle With Care\u201d (1977), originally titled \u201cCitizens Band,\u201d about an eccentric network of rural Americans linked by trucks and CB radios, and \u201cMelvin and Howard\u201d (1980), a tale inspired by true events, which starred Jason Robards as the billionaire recluse Howard Hughes and Paul LeMat as an earnestly good-natured gas station owner who picks him up in the desert after Hughes has crashed his motorcycle. Hughes ostensibly leaves a colossal fortune to the man, who never gets the money, of course, losing his claim to it in court. \u201cMr. Demme and Bo Goldman, his screenwriter, take Melvin\u2019s tale at face value and present the movie as Melvin\u2019s wildest dream,\u201d Vincent Canby wrote in a review in The New York Times. \u201cThe comic catch is that this wild dream is essentially so prosaic. It\u2019s also touched with pathos since Melvin \u2014 in spite of himself \u2014 knows that it will never be realized. This is the story of his life.\u201d Later, as a known commodity, Mr. Demme directed prestige Hollywood projects like \u201cBeloved\u201d (1998), an adaptation of Toni Morrison\u2019s novel about the lingering, post-Civil War psychological horror of slavery, with Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover in starring roles, and \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate\u201d (2004), a remake of the 1962 Cold War drama of the same title about a brainwashed American prisoner of war. Mr. Demme\u2019s updated version, starring Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, takes place during the Persian Gulf war. Mr. Demme may be best remembered for that pair of films from the 1990s that were, at the time, his career\u2019s biggest anomalies. The first, \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d (1991), was a vivid thriller based on the novel by Thomas Harris that earned five Oscars, including best picture and best director. Unlike his previous films, with their arch amusement and tender melancholy, this was straightforward and serious storytelling with only a few moments of shivery humor. The story is told largely from the perspective of an F.B.I. trainee who becomes a key figure in the pursuit of a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill when she is assigned to conduct a prison interview with Hannibal Lecter, a mad and murderous psychiatrist, hoping to extract from him clues to Bill\u2019s identity. Lurid and titillating, the film is full of the perverse details of heinous crimes and marked by a seductively ambiguous bond that forms between the young agent-to-be, Clarice Starling, and the brilliant monster Lecter. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both won Oscars for their memorably distinct character portrayals. The movie is also marked by Mr. Demme\u2019s characteristically restless camera and the prominent use of music. The score, with its eerie leitmotif, is by Howard Shore. Mr. Demme\u2019s next narrative venture, \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d (1993), brought to the fore the strain of advocacy in his work that was otherwise evident in his documentaries about Haiti, former President Jimmy Carter, New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and his cousin, Robert W. Castle, a white activist priest in Harlem. \u201cPhiladelphia,\u201d from a script by Ron Nyswaner, starred Tom Hanks, as an ambitious lawyer who is fired from his prestigious firm when the partners learn he has H.I.V., and Denzel Washington, as the scrappy independent lawyer who represents him in a suit against the firm. It was the first big-budget Hollywood film about AIDS, and with its forthright depiction of homosexuality, homophobia and the disease that was rampaging through the gay community, it became a turning point in the way mainstream American movies treated gay men and lesbians, whose sexual orientation had previously been treated with hush-hush delicacy or flamboyant caricature. Mr. Hanks won an Oscar, and so did Bruce Springsteen, for the song that introduces the film, \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Rock music \u2014 music in general, really, but rock and its Caribbean siblings most of all \u2014 is central to many of Mr. Demme\u2019s films. Among them was one of his last, \u201cRicki and the Flash\u201d (2015), which starred Meryl Streep as the aging singer of a bar band in California who is the ex-wife of a well-to-do Indianapolis businessman (Kevin Kline) and the estranged mother of their children. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll plays a heroic role in the film, knitting the family back together as Ms. Streep, playing with Rick Springfield among others, covers several rock standards, including Mr. Springsteen\u2019s \u201cMy Love Will Not Let You Down\u201d and Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d a song that is featured in at least two of Mr. Demme\u2019s other movies as well. \u201cMusic was my first love, movies came second,\u201d Mr. Demme once told the long-defunct New York newspaper The SoHo News. In a 1988 interview with Premiere magazine, he said: \u201cI grew up with rock \u2019n\u2019 roll \u2014 literally,\u201d adding, \u201cThe first rock song I remember was \u2018Sh-Boom,\u2019 and since then I\u2019ve never stopped obsessing on at least something.\u201d The synchronization with music and narrative is most evident in \u201cSomething Wild\u201d (1986), a \u201creally screwball\u201d comedy, as Pauline Kael of The New Yorker Kael described it, that \u201cbreaks conventions and turns into a scary slapstick thriller.\u201d The beginning, set in New York City, features a telling establishing shot, perfect for the time and place \u2014 the Reagan \u201980s, with its ostentatious masters of the universe and a teeming, disdainful underclass \u2014 in which the head of a young man with a boom box on his shoulder is held briefly but firmly in the frame before the camera moves. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other director who is so instinctively and democratically interested in everybody he shows you,\u201d Kael wrote. The movie tells the story of Charlie Driggs (Jeff Daniels), a straight-arrow tax consultant, who is seduced away from his humdrum office life by a hedonistic and charmingly flaky young woman played by Melanie Griffith. Calling herself Lulu, she inveigles him into a road trip that takes the pair from rebellious delight into danger and violence (in the form of Lulu\u2019s ex-husband, an ex-con played by Ray Liotta in his movie debut) before its rather pallid Hollywood denouement. What elevates the ending from disappointing sentiment to a winking, it\u2019s-only-a-movie joy is the credit sequence, in which the singer Sister Carol, who plays a minor role in the film, sways against a graffiti-splashed wall and performs a reggae variation on the 1960s standard \u201cWild Thing.\u201d The song was one of 49 to be featured in the movie, which also included music by Jimmy Cliff, Oingo Boingo, Fine Young Cannibals and David Byrne of Talking Heads. Mr. Byrne and Mr. Demme worked together frequently, notably on \u201cStop Making Sense,\u201d a 1984 concert film about Talking Heads that many critics (and filmgoers) found mesmerizing, though it had few filmic bells and whistles. (Mr. Demme preferred to call it a \u201cperformance film\u201d because, he said, it wasn\u2019t about the concert experience \u2014 he didn\u2019t show the audience until the end.) Mr. Byrne also scored Mr. Demme\u2019s \u201cMarried to the Mob,\u201d a gaudy 1988 farce in which Michelle Pfeiffer plays the wife of a Long Island gangster (Alec Baldwin) who tries to exit the mob life after her husband is bumped off when he dallies with the girlfriend of the local boss (Dean Stockwell). Things get especially dicey when she moves with her young son into a shabby Manhattan apartment and strikes up a romance with the F.B.I. agent (Matthew Modine) who has her under surveillance. In her review of the film, Janet Maslin of The Times took note of the m\u00e9lange of Mr. Demme\u2019s filmmaking eccentricities \u2014 not just the music, \u201cwhich drifts mischievously through the film,\u201d but the details of costume and language and performance that are all pitched to a particular note of fond, giggly amusement. \u201cJonathan Demme is the American cinema\u2019s king of amusing artifacts: blinding bric-a-brac, the junkiest of jewelry, costumes so frightening they take your breath away,\u201d Ms. Maslin wrote. \u201cMr. Demme may joke, but he\u2019s also capable of suggesting that the very fabric of American life may be woven of such things, and that it takes a merry and adventurous spirit to make the most of them.\u201d Robert Jonathan Demme was born on Long Island, in Baldwin, on on Feb. 22, 1944, and grew up mostly in nearby Rockville Centre, where he listened to music and went to the movies. His father, Robert, was a publicist in the travel industry; his mother was the former Dorothy Rogers. (Years later, at age 71, Dorothy Demme appeared in a music video for UB40 and Chrissie Hynde, directed by her son. She later appeared in some of his films, including \u201cSomething Wild\u201d and \u201cPhiladelphia.\u201d She died in 1995.) The family moved to Miami, where Jonathan went to high school and worked for a time in a kennel and an animal hospital. Wanting to be a veterinarian, he attended the University of Florida with that in mind until he failed chemistry, at which point he went to the university newspaper, discovered it had no movie critic, and assumed the job himself, he told interviewers, so he could go to the movies with free admission. He also became a critic for a shopping guide in Coral Gables, for which he wrote a glowing notice for \u201cZulu\u201d (1964), about a bloody 19th-century battle between British soldiers and African warriors, a film whose executive producer was Joseph E. Levine, the founder of Embassy Pictures, the film\u2019s American distributor. It happened that Mr. Levine was on vacation in Miami Beach, staying at the Fontainebleau Hotel, where he had become acquainted with the hotel\u2019s publicist, Robert Demme. The elder Demme introduced Levine to his son, whose review of \u201cZulu\u201d impressed him. Levine offered him a job. Mr. Demme worked in the Embassy publicity department (the company changed its name to AVCO Embassy in 1967) in New York and also held other jobs in and around the film business, including writing film and music reviews, before moving to London in 1969. There he earned his first film credit, as music coordinator for \u201cSudden Terror\u201d (1970), a thriller about a boy who believes he is being hunted by a killer, for which he corralled several rock bands and put together a score. In 1971 he took a job as a unit publicist in Ireland for a Roger Corman film, \u201cVon Richthofen and Brown,\u201d about a German flying ace. Shortly after that he began making films of his own for Corman\u2019s production company. He wrote (with Joe Viola) and produced a biker film, \u201cAngels Hard as They Come,\u201d and wrote and directed a handful of others, including \u201cCaged Heat\u201d (1974), a heavy-breathing women\u2019s prison movie; \u201cCrazy Mama\u201d (1975), a campy road story with a \u201950s rock score that starred Ann Sothern and Cloris Leachman as mother-and-daughter outlaws; and \u201cFighting Mad\u201d (1976), starring Peter Fonda as a farmer battling corrupt land developers in Arkansas. After several other directors passed on \u201cCitizens Band,\u201d a script by Paul Brickman, Paramount hired Mr. Demme to direct it. The movie had the wry humor of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, one of Mr. Demme\u2019s idols, and an interconnected group story that echoed Robert Altman\u2019s \u201cNashville,\u201d but it flopped at the box office (both immediately and later, when it was rereleased as \u201cHandle with Care\u201d). Still, movie insiders recognized the touch of a sly and promising director. Thom Mount, at the time the head of production at Universal, called Mr. Demme to direct \u201cMelvin and Howard\u201d after Mike Nichols had dropped out of the project. The movie opened the New York Film Festival and drew rave reviews, a pair of Oscars (for Mr. Goldman\u2019s script and for Mary Steenburgen\u2019s supporting role as Melvin\u2019s beleaguered wife) and a best picture citation by the National Society of Film Critics. Mr. Demme\u2019s first marriage, to Evelyn Purcell, ended in divorce. He later married Joanne Howard, an artist. She survives him along with three children, Brooklyn, Ramona and Jos. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Demme also had a home in Nyack, N.Y. Mr. Demme\u2019s other films include documentaries about the folk-rock singer and songwriter Neil Young; concert films featuring the country singer Kenny Chesney and the pop star Justin Timberlake; and \u201cSwimming to Cambodia\u201d (1987), Spalding Gray\u2019s monologue ruminating about Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and his experience appearing in the film \u201cThe Killing Fields.\u201d Mr. Demme was a member of the alternative arts scene of Lower Manhattan, which included Mr. Gray, who died in 2004, as well as Mr. Byrne and the composer and performer Laurie Anderson, who scored \u201cSwimming to Cambodia.\u201d His other narrative features included \u201cSwing Shift\u201d (1984), a story about female factory workers during World War II that starred Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell and Christine Lahti. Mr. Demme and Ms. Hawn clashed over the film\u2019s editing, and the result was a film generally seen as unsatisfying. Better was \u201cThe Truth About Charlie\u201d (2002), a well-paced remake of \u201cCharade,\u201d the 1963 thriller set in Paris about a woman (Thandie Newton was Mr. Demme\u2019s stand-in for Audrey Hepburn) pursued by men who are out to reclaim a treasure filched by her husband, who has turned up dead. And even better was \u201cRachel Getting Married\u201d (2008). Set during a weekend in which Rachel (Rosemary DeWitt), a white woman, is to wed her black fianc\u00e9, Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe), the film presents a protean and diverse gathering of the two families and various friends within and around the sprawling Connecticut home of Rachel\u2019s father (Bill Irwin) and his second wife (Anna Deavere Smith). The main element of friction in the film is Rachel\u2019s sister, Kym (Anne Hathaway), an intelligent and breathtakingly needy young woman who arrives on furlough from nine months in drug rehab. Filmed in a documentary style with an array of musical genres on the soundtrack \u2014 though it is only music that the wedding guests hear \u2014 \u201cRachel Getting Married\u201d recalls another Altman film about a similar occasion, \u201cA Wedding,\u201d in its piling up of characters and snatches of conversation. It gives viewers a sense of being wedding guests themselves \u2014 \u201can experience we\u2019ve all had,\u201d as the critic Roger Ebert wrote. He added, \u201cWe don\u2019t meet everyone at a wedding, but we observe everyone.\u201d In many ways, \u201cRachel Getting Married\u201d synthesizes the main characteristics and concerns of Mr. Demme\u2019s body of work. Among the wedding guests are several character actors who make appearances in other Demme films, so there\u2019s a family within a family on the screen. And in its obvious but casual multiethnicity, the movie recognizes, with the progressive hopefulness often present in his films, an American whole after providing many close-ups of individual slices. \u201cIt might seem that this tableau is a kind of utopian wish fulfillment, the na\u00efve projection of a longed-for harmony that does not yet exist,\u201d A. O. Scott wrote in his Times review. \u201cTo some extent this may be true, but the texture of \u2018Rachel Getting Married\u2019 is so loose and lived in, its faces (many of them belonging to nonprofessional actors) so interesting and real, that it looks more plausibly like a mirror of the way things are. \u201cIt is not that racial division is willed away or made to disappear,\u201d Mr. Scott continued, \u201cbut rather that, on this particular weekend, other matters are more important. A wedding, after all, represents a symbolic as well as an actual union, an intimation of possible perfection in a decidedly imperfect world.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T12:39:13-04:00", "section": "Movies", "abstract": "Mr. Demme, an auteur whose films included documentaries and narrative features, won an Academy Award for \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
