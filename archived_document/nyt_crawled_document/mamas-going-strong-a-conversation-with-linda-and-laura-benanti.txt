{"text": "Fans of Laura Benanti, the Tony Award-winning actress of Broadway (\u201cGypsy\u201d) and television (\u201cSupergirl,\u201d \u201cThe Sound of Music Live!\u201d), know that she has an entertainingly complicated relationship with her mother, Linda. Linda Benanti, a voice teacher and former Broadway actress, is often name-checked in her daughter\u2019s cabaret show and on her Twitter feed, portrayed \u2014 in Laura\u2019s telling, anyway \u2014 as a voice of well-intentioned parental nagging, encouragement and reason. It\u2019s a bond that has grown even stronger since Laura gave birth to a daughter of her own, Ella Rose Benanti-Brown, on Feb. 14. Linda and Laura Benanti will bring their delightfully sparring relationship, as well as some of their favorite songs, to audiences in a cabaret show, \u201cThe Story Goes On,\u201d that they will perform at Feinstein\u2019s/54 Below on May 5 and 6. Recently, at Laura Benanti\u2019s home in West Harlem, Laura was settling into her new life as a mother, with baby Ella snoozing in her lap, while Linda looked on in appreciation. Together they tried to predict how Linda\u2019s mothering skills had been passed down (\u201cI\u2019m going to be that weird parent at the sleepover, trying to make sure everybody\u2019s nice to her,\u201d Laura announced), while also campaigning not-so-subtly for the performer\u2019s next Broadway role. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How has your relationship changed since Ella was born?LAURA She was here for the first 10 days of Ella\u2019s life. LINDA Pitched a tent, moved in, took care of them so [Laura and Patrick Brown, her husband] could take care of the baby. And then they came out to our house. LAURA Because I lost my mind. The first 10 days, it was like, everything\u2019s perfect! The baby\u2019s amazing! And then the day she left, everything went to hell. The baby was inconsolable.  Did you always know Laura would grow up to be an actress?LINDA Oh, Laura knew. [Laughs] It wasn\u2019t me saying: \u201cYou know what, honey? I think you might like this.\u201d This was Laura getting up on her wooden Fisher-Price slide, going, \u201cPresenting \u2014 !\u201dLAURA Shy. Always shy. My first words were, \u201cCan I have an agent?\u201dLINDA I filmed her saying that. Laura, when did you realize that your mother was a talented performer in her own right?LAURA When I was 5 years old, I was coming up the stairs, and I saw my mom standing there, singing \u201cA Quiet Thing\u201d a cappella, and it was such a differentiating moment for me. I realized that we are separate from each other \u2014 she has dreams and goals. You weren\u2019t just there to bring me stuff. It stuck with me my whole life. LINDA You used to critique my voice students. This one particular student was not great. Laura was on my lap, I think you were about 2, and he sang and she looked at him and she went, \u201cNo.\u201d LAURA Telling people what to do since 1981. Linda, how could you be sure your professional assessments of Laura were objective, and not just coming from a place of motherly pride?LAURA I\u2019m actually interested in this answer as well. LINDA It\u2019s complicated. I was trying not to go, \u201cThat\u2019s my daughter \u2014 she\u2019s brilliant!\u201d Because I see a lot of moms like that. But as a voice teacher, I know someone\u2019s voice could develop really early and then plateau out. You wait and see. My husband and I both felt it was really important for her to develop who she is from the inside. LAURA You\u2019re going to get so much hate mail from the stage moms. The entire cast of \u201cSchool of Rock\u201d is going to come after you. What is it like now, to see Laura go through a negative experience, like not getting a role she wanted \u2014 LAURA Never. No. Always got it. So, no that one. \u2014 or getting a bad review? How do you process that as her mother?LAURA How do you process that?LINDA I think you process that like any parent would process anything that happens to their child. Having been in the industry before, I was probably more nervous than a normal parent would have been. And more excited than a normal parent. LAURA A bad review, you\u2019re like, meh. But when it\u2019s been personal, you want to protect me and correct someone\u2019s misinterpretation. LINDA And hit them.  Laura was in \u201cGypsy,\u201d a show about a notorious stage mother who comes to resent her daughter for achieving a stardom she did not. Did you feel any of those feelings yourself?LAURA She\u2019s like the opposite. Even in my speech, I called her the anti-Mama Rose. [Breathlessly] When I won the Tony Award. LINDA I never, ever felt, \u201cOh, that should have been me.\u201d Not in a million years. LAURA You were saying for years I should play her. LINDA There\u2019s a lot of roles that I always thought that about \u2014 Amalia [in \u201cShe Loves Me\u201d] was one of them. Louise [in \u201cGypsy\u201d] was one of them. LAURA [Whispers] Say \u201cMy Fair Lady.\u201d LINDA And \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d is definitely one of them. Gee! Obviously. LAURA Good job. When did you commit to these concerts at Feinstein\u2019s/54 Below?LAURA When I was pregnant, and, like, \u201cBeing a mom\u2019s going to be easy!\u201d And now I\u2019m like, \u201cGreat.\u201d LINDA It\u2019ll be fine. LAURA I\u2019m excited to do this with you. I wish you had continued on, because you\u2019re so talented. I wish you\u2019d been able to pursue that for yourself, and that you weren\u2019t in a position where you had to take care of me, and transition solely to being a voice teacher. I feel like 35 years later, you have an opportunity to share your gift with people, and it is a gift.  Do you think Ella will follow in Laura\u2019s footsteps?LAURA My husband was playing the piano for Ella \u2014 he was playing \u201cF\u00fcr Elise,\u201d the only piano piece he remembers \u2014 and her eyes welled up with tears. And we were like, whoa, O.K., that\u2019s a one-off. He did it again the next day \u2014 same thing. LINDA She\u2019s going to sing. LAURA She better. LINDA Laura had a very husky voice when she was a baby. And as her mom, I thought, where does she get this? We called her Moose. LAURA I\u2019ve talked to a lot of therapists about this.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/theater/mamas-going-strong-a-conversation-with-linda-and-laura-benanti.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T05:00:30-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T05:00:30-04:00", "abstract": "Laura Benanti, the Tony-winning actress and a new mother, talks with her own mom, Linda, a former stage actress and co-star of her new cabaret show.", "title": "Mamas Going Strong: A Conversation With Linda and Laura Benanti"}
