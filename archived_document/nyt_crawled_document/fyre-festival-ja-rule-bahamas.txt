{"text": "A supposedly opulent music festival on a private island in the Bahamas, which was plugged as an unprecedented V.I.P. event by Instagram influencers including Kendall Jenner and Emily Ratajkowski, descended into dysfunction and disarray as soon as it began on Thursday and has since been postponed indefinitely, organizers said. The inaugural Fyre Festival, founded by the rapper Ja Rule and the tech entrepreneur Billy McFarland, was set to feature performances by G.O.O.D. Music, Blink-182, Migos, Lil Yachty, Major Lazer and more \u2014 plus \u201cfirst-class culinary experiences and a luxury atmosphere,\u201d with ticket packages reaching six-figures for chartered yachts and private planes. But when guests arrived for the first weekend on Thursday, they found grounds that were woefully lacking in the promised amenities and organization, according to accounts on social media that highlighted the soggy tents, bad food and general disappointment verging on panic. By Friday morning, the festival was in damage-control mode as attendees attempted to flee the gathering. \u201cFyre Festival set out to provide a once-in-a-lifetime musical experience on the Islands of the Exumas,\u201d the organizers said in a statement. \u201cDue to circumstances out of our control, the physical infrastructure was not in place on time and we are unable to fulfill on that vision safely and enjoyably for our guests.\u201d \u201cAt this time, we are working tirelessly to get flights scheduled and get everyone off of Great Exuma and home safely as quickly as we can,\u201d they continued. \u201cWe are working to place everyone on complimentary charters back to Miami today; this process has commenced and the comfort and safety of our guests is our top priority.\u201d Eddie James, a representative for the festival, said in a brief interview that some guests were still on site as of early Friday afternoon. \u201cBut there are plans in place to get everybody off the island safely today,\u201d he said. The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism expressed its dismay in a statement on Friday, citing the festival\u2019s \u201cdisorganization and chaos.\u201d It continued: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in the way the events unfolded yesterday with the Fyre Festival. We offer a heartfelt apology to all who traveled to our country for this event.\u201d The reality of the festival \u2014 which had been set to repeat for a second three-day weekend from May 5 to 7 \u2014 was a far cry from what was sold in a series of glamorous Instagram posts and other promotional material. \u201cMiles of white beach and turquoise water await attendees for a variety of sonic, communal and artistic activities,\u201d one early description said. \u201cA marina which serves as V.I.P. docking space for yachts is located within yards of the festival grounds. Guests can choose to stay in a variety of tented accommodations, V.I.P. housing or private yachts.\u201d Attendees were told they could \u201cstart each day with morning yoga and guided meditation on the beach,\u201d while also enjoying \u201cmassages, henna tattooing, sound healing, chill-out sessions and a festive Bahamian junkanoo parade kicking-off each weekend.\u201d Descriptions of the food options pledged \u201ca uniquely authentic island cuisine experience,\u201d with \u201clocal seafood, Bahamian-style sushi and even a pig roast.\u201d Fyre was attempting to compete amid an increasingly elaborate landscape of boutique music festivals that have sprung up in the mold of industry leaders like Coachella and Desert Trip. Mr. McFarland, the co-founder, told Vanity Fair earlier this week, \u201cObviously we think our lineup now is pretty awesome, but the experience is what we\u2019re really packaging here.\u201d (Tickets ran from about $1,000 to $12,000, though a spokeswoman for the event told Vanity Fair it was possible to spend \u201cin excess of $104,995\u201d for add-ons.) There were, however, some early indications that what was being positioned as \u201cthe cultural experience of the decade\u201d may not have been ready for the crowds. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that some artists had not yet been paid in accordance with their contracts, while guests \u2014 about 7,000 people were expected \u2014 complained of a concierge service that was slow to make contact. On Friday, Fyre Festival said the whole thing was on hold \u201cuntil we can further assess if and when we are able to create the high-quality experience we envisioned.\u201d \u201cWe ask for everyone\u2019s patience and cooperation during this difficult time,\u201d Fyre said, \u201cas we work as quickly and safely as we can to remedy this unforeseeable situation.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/music/fyre-festival-ja-rule-bahamas.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T12:15:28-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T12:15:28-04:00", "abstract": "A high-end event founded by Ja Rule and the entrepreneur Billy McFarland was supposed to feature shows and yachts.
