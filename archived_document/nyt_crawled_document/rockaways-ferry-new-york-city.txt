{"text": "If all New Yorkers were as grateful to Mayor Bill de Blasio for expanding ferry service as residents of the Rockaways seemed on Sunday, this year\u2019s mayoral election might be declared no contest. The mayor received a hero\u2019s welcome on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens a day before the scheduled launch of daily ferry service between the peninsula and Manhattan (with a stop in Brooklyn along the way). Some local residents and elected officials representing the Rockaways cheered the mayor and then rode along with him to Manhattan on the Urban Journey, a new boat that was christened for the occasion. \u201cThank you very, very much,\u201d said Lew M. Simon, a Democrat like Mr. de Blasio and an Assembly district leader from Rockaway Park. \u201cYou kept your word. Bless you.\u201d The Rockaway route is the first of several new legs of a service that is intended to reach every borough but Staten Island. One of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s most heavily promoted initiatives, the service is coming at a high price to the city \u2014 but not to riders. The city has pledged to spend more than $325 million to build and operate 20 ferries that will connect 22 landings in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Mr. de Blasio has promised to hold the fare even with that of the subway, currently $2.75 per ride. That is quite a bargain for the hourlong trip to Wall Street from the dock at Beach 108th Street and Beach Channel Drive in a 149-passenger boat equipped with Wi-Fi, bike racks and a concession stand selling snacks and drinks, including draft beer and wine, said Delia Brooks, a resident of Belle Harbor. \u201cIt\u2019s a good deal,\u201d said Mrs. Brooks, who was admiring two of the new ferries with her husband, Keith. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make our life much better.\u201d Mrs. Brooks said she would take the boat to appointments with doctors in Brooklyn and speculated that schoolchildren would ride the ferries on field trips to Manhattan to visit museums and see Broadway shows. Mr. Brooks said he thought the ferry service would also attract more visitors to the Rockaways. \u201cA lot of the people from Manhattan, the hipsters, are going to come flying out here now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to revitalize the area. We\u2019re going to need more restaurants.\u201d Mr. de Blasio seemed energized by the reception the ferries received. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that this administration has kept our promise to the people of the Rockaways,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow morning, a new era begins in New York City,\u201d he said, alluding to the scheduled start of service at 5:30 a.m. Monday. \u201cTomorrow morning, we go back to the water.\u201d Mr. de Blasio said the expanded ferry service was intended to provide New Yorkers with another way to get to and from work and could help to ease the congestion of the city\u2019s streets and subways. Wearing a suit but no tie, Mr. de Blasio even took a turn at the helm, steering the boat past Breezy Point before turning the controls over to Councilman Donovan J. Richards of Queens, a fellow Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s like driving a Fiat,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cVery responsive.\u201d The Urban Journey, which the mayor said sounded \u201clike a \u201970s rock band,\u201d eventually will run on other routes on the East River. Built by Horizon Shipbuilding in Bayou La Batre, Ala., it is one of five ferries that have been delivered so far. Metal Shark, a shipyard in Louisiana, is building some ferries with deeper hulls and larger engines to manage the rougher waters near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge between Staten Island and Brooklyn. City officials enlisted second-grade classes in Brooklyn to suggest names for the first batch of boats. \u201cLunch Box\u201d and \u201cFriendship Express\u201d were two of the winners, along with \u201cMcShiny,\u201d which Mr. de Blasio said was his personal favorite. On the inside, though, the boats have a more grown-up atmosphere, with dark gray seats, work spaces and concessions operated by the New Stand. Andrew Deitchman, the company\u2019s chief executive, said the boats going to the Rockaways might carry sunscreen, flip-flops and Frisbees. Now, Mr. de Blasio implied, the onus is on city residents to ride the ferries in numbers sufficient to justify the city\u2019s investment. \u201cIf this works as well as we hope, if people ride this, we can go farther,\u201d the mayor said, hinting at the possibility of expanding the service beyond current plans. Those were encouraging words to Terry MacRae, the chief executive of Hornblower, the company that will operate the ferries. \u201cIf there\u2019s demand and it\u2019s good service, everyone will rush to take credit and want more of it,\u201d he said. Just a year ago, doubts about the city\u2019s ability to create a ferry fleet from scratch seemed rampant. Tom Fox, who formerly ran the Water Taxi service in New York, was one of the skeptics. \u201cThere was a lot of skepticism, and they proved the skeptics wrong,\u201d Mr. Fox said on Sunday. \u201cWhen you\u2019re wrong, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how they operate the service.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/nyregion/rockaways-ferry-new-york-city.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T05:00:33-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T05:00:33-04:00", "abstract": "Mayor Bill de Blasio received a hero\u2019s welcome in Queens a day before the start of an hourlong route from the peninsula to Brooklyn and Manhattan.", "title": "To Rockaways Residents, New Ferry Service Is a Promise Kept"}
