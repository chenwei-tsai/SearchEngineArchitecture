Yet as her band, Paramore, worked to transcend its restrictive genre dogmas across four increasingly ambitious albums, taking the angsty pop punk of the Myspace moment to the Grammys and the Billboard charts largely on the strength of Ms. Williams\u2019s voice, the singer, now 28, began to feel beholden to a visual shtick. Last year, staring down a deep depression amid more personnel changes in a band plagued by them \u2014 and questioning herself under the hefty burdens of adulthood \u2014 Ms. Williams opted for \u201ca blank slate,\u201d she said, her currently white-blond locks further minimized under a beanie. \u201cYou can run on the fumes of being a teenager for as long as you want, but eventually life hits you really hard,\u201d Ms. Williams, a mighty presence who barely cracks five feet, explained last month, speaking for the first time about the tumultuous period since Paramore last released an album, in 2013. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know if we were going to make another record,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a moment when I didn\u2019t even want it to happen. Then it was like, I want it to happen, but I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d Paramore, somehow, pulled it off again. On May 12, the band will release \u201cAfter Laughter,\u201d its fifth LP, introducing another lineup \u2014 each Paramore album has featured a different combination of members around Ms. Williams \u2014 and, more notably, a new sound. Instead of the meaty, distorted power chords and hyperactive riffs of its adolescence, Paramore has dipped into cleaner, more rhythmic and synth-kissed textures of the \u201970s and \u201980s, owing to recent obsessions with Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Cyndi Lauper and Blondie. But while the group has long functioned in its own bizarre hybrid milieu \u2014 \u201ctoo rock for pop and too pop for rock,\u201d said the guitarist and Ms. Williams\u2019s chief songwriting partner, Taylor York \u2014 Paramore returns to a Top 40 landscape even less hospitable to guitars than the one it left on an idiosyncratic high note. (\u201cAin\u2019t It Fun,\u201d which won a Grammy for best rock song, was also the band\u2019s highest-charting crossover single.) In pop, a throwback \u201980s sound has since been tried with varying degrees of faithfulness and success by the likes of Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen and Jason Derulo, but has not, of late, been credibly executed by a band. Paramore, though, may be suited to this moment: Ms. Williams, cartoon hair or not, remains the focus, and her nimble melodies and sneakily huge pop hooks are as crisp and magnetic as ever, unbeholden to genre walls. As a frontwoman, Ms. Williams\u2019s shadow of influence has only grown during her break from music, with the most vibrant rock, especially in offshoots of punk, coming increasingly from female-led bands who aren\u2019t afraid of a chorus. Bethany Cosentino, the lead singer of Best Coast, called Ms. Williams an industry mentor, despite being her elder by two years. \u201cShe\u2019s the most humble person I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d Ms. Cosentino said. \u201cShe\u2019s a major superstar, but on any given day in Nashville you\u2019ll see her in the back at a show. She\u2019s still true to her punk roots.\u201d Ms. Williams demurred at suggestions that for a new generation of female musicians, she represents what Gwen Stefani of No Doubt and Shirley Manson of Garbage were for her, insisting that she is the one inspired by much younger acts like Cherry Glazerr, Tacocat and Bleached. But she also recalled her determination when Paramore started in a male-dominated scene. \u201cIf we were booked on a bill with all dudes that were twice as old as us I wanted to be better than any of them,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care if they had a penis or not. I had to be great at my job.\u201d Musically, her band \u201ccan do whatever we want and then when Hayley gets on it, that\u2019s what makes it Paramore,\u201d Mr. York, 27, said, adding that his recent guitar tones and phrasings had also been inspired by Afrobeat and other international sounds. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a point with our new music where we don\u2019t really want to headbang anymore.\u201d In addition to a fresh direction, \u201cAfter Laughter\u201d is a partial reunion for the group, which, during recording, welcomed back the drummer and founding member Zac Farro. Formed in 2004 as a teenage garage band in Franklin, Tenn., Paramore fractured nearly seven years ago when Mr. Farro and his older brother, Josh, then the main songwriter, quit in a fit of acrimony, having dubbed the band \u201ca manufactured product of a major label\u201d that \u201cbecame all about Hayley.\u201d (Paramore\u2019s 2011 damage-control interview with MTV is an excruciating document of an awkward period.) Mr. Farro\u2019s homecoming developed gradually after a personal rekindling with Mr. York, his childhood best friend, that became a necessity because the pair kept running into each other socially. \u201cEvery teenage year that I lived was in this band, on tour,\u201d said Mr. Farro, 26, a lovable goof whose mellow presence balances that of his more high-strung bandmates. \u201cI needed a reset button.\u201d Carlos de la Garza, who worked as an audio engineer on \u201cAfter Laughter\u201d and its self-titled predecessor, called Mr. York and Mr. Farro, who spent his time away traveling New Zealand and making his own music, \u201ctrue kindred spirits.\u201d What resulted from that refreshed partnership were many jubilant, even danceable, instrumental tracks that Ms. Williams then flipped on their head. \u201cThere was a little bit of a dark side creeping in to Hayley\u2019s psyche,\u201d Mr. de la Garza said. \u201cSomething was eating at her, and she was able to use a lot of that as fuel for lyrics.\u201d Despite the joyful, collaborative energy that stemmed from the reconciliation with Mr. Farro, Ms. Williams agreed that \u201cthere was a dark cloud\u201d over the writing and recording process, stemming from relationship issues both personal and professional. In the last two years, \u201cA lot of life happened,\u201d said Ms. Williams, who married a fellow musician, Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory, last February. Just before that, Paramore announced that it had parted with its longtime bassist, Jeremy Davis, who in a lawsuit invoked claims that have long dogged the band, and especially Ms. Williams. While Mr. Davis contends in court papers that he was a creative partner, entitled to additional profits from songwriting royalties, merchandise and live shows, pre-emptive filings on behalf of Ms. Williams noted that she is the only member officially signed to Atlantic Records, leaving the rest of Paramore to be paid as at-will employees. (Lawyers for the singer noted that \u201cbecause she wanted to foster a feeling of camaraderie within the band, at her direction, the band members\u2019 salaries included a portion of Williams\u2019 earnings.\u201d) Derek Crownover, a lawyer for Mr. Davis, said in a statement: \u201cJeremy Davis did not leave the band,\u201d adding that the bassist \u201cdid not initiate the lawsuit either.\u201d While the case is ongoing, Mr. Crownover expressed hope for an amicable settlement soon. \u201cAgain?\u201d Ms. Williams asked herself as she pondered the group\u2019s fate. \u201cI prayed until my knees bled, pretty much,\u201d she said, acknowledging that Paramore has at times felt more like a soap opera than a band. \u201cWe were down another member \u2014 same old story almost from Day 1,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt made me question everything \u2014 am I doing something wrong? You read things that people say about you and eventually you just think, \u2018Oh, I must be some kind of diva bitch.\u2019 I know that\u2019s not me, but it caused a lot of self-doubt.\u201d Ms. Williams, never one for love songs, channeled her disquiet into an album preoccupied with betrayal, disappointment and regret. \u201cHard Times,\u201d the opening song and first single, begins with lines like, Elsewhere, she sings, \u201cI can\u2019t think of getting old/it only makes me want to die,\u201d while other album highlights are titled \u201cForgiveness\u201d (sample lyric: \u201cI just can\u2019t do it yet\u201d), \u201cFake Happy\u201d and \u201cGrudges.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine putting something on an album that says \u2018life\u2019s great, everything\u2019s cool, party with me,\u2019\u201d Ms. Williams said. And it\u2019s true that despite long-running accusations of major-label meddling in Paramore\u2019s career, the band has written its own often-bitter songs across three straight platinum albums without fiddling from the pop machine. Though its members said their record label has previously tried to pair them with hitmakers of the moment, \u201cWe\u2019ve somehow earned our freedom,\u201d said Mr. York, Paramore\u2019s softest spoken member. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine getting up there and playing a Max Martin song,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point we might as well just stop.\u201d Now, as Paramore moves from re-establishing its foundation in private to the public glare of an obsessive, impatient fan base, its members are openly anxious about how it will be portrayed and received. One recent night, the trio attended a hockey game for its hometown Nashville Predators, something they hadn\u2019t done as a group since childhood. Exceedingly gracious to all who recognized them, there remained a nervous but endearing energy among the band, not unlike recently reconciled exes around skeptical old friends. Yet in quiet moments, as Mr. York, Mr. Farro and Ms. Williams picked food out of each other\u2019s teeth and retreated to the safety of inside jokes, they couldn\u2019t help but seem downright content. \u201cThis is what you go through hard times for, so you can have these moments where you\u2019re proud of yourself, proud of your choices and your friends,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cI have a public diary of my life,\u201d she added, \u201cand I feel useful because of it.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/arts/music/paramore-hayley-williams-after-laughter-interview.html", "section": "Arts", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "Hayley Williams and her band, which haven\u2019t released an album since 2013, return with \u201cAfter Laughter.\u201d", "title": "Paramore Bounces Back With Old Faces and a New Sound", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T12:00:17-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
