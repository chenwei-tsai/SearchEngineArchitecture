{"text": "BOSTON \u2014 When Kris Bryant gobbled up the grounder last fall and made the throw that landed in Anthony Rizzo\u2019s glove at first base, a wave of joyous disbelief washed over Quinn Ehemann. His Chicago Cubs had finally won the World Series. \u201cI\u2019ve waited my whole life for this,\u201d he said. Did we mention that Quinn is 10 years old? As his parents, Beth and Chris, recounted the story Friday afternoon, they stood alongside a friend, Megan Ward, who laughed along. The Ehemanns are Cubs fans who live outside Chicago, and Ward, a card-carrying Red Sox fan, is from Boston. But as the Cubs arrived for a weekend series, these friends were outside Fenway Park sharing common ground in a way that fans of two sports franchises rarely can. If Cubs fans endured several lifetimes of disappointment, replete with heartbreak and talk of curses, before they won a World Series for the first time in 108 years, they have kindred spirits in Red Sox fans. Their goblins were vanquished in 2004, when the Red Sox ended their championship drought at a mere 86 seasons. Now, just as the Red Sox had to do, the Cubs are learning to cope with an altogether foreign problem: success. \u201cIt\u2019s like we were always the guy at the dance who could never get a date with the pretty girl,\u201d said Jonathan Gates, 54, of Boston. \u201cNow, we are the dance.\u201d The Cubs and Red Sox share more than histories. They play in the two oldest parks in baseball, Fenway and Wrigley Field, jewels at the center of rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods. They also share an architect, of course \u2014 Theo Epstein, the boy-wonder general manager when the Red Sox won in 2004 (and again in 2007) who then left to build a championship team in Chicago. Epstein, who grew up in nearby Brookline, was back at Fenway this weekend for the first time since he left after the 2011 season, frustrated with the political infighting after the Red Sox had collapsed in September and missed the playoffs. He arrived Thursday, went for a jog along the Charles River and then watched the last few innings of the Red Sox\u2019 loss to the Yankees with his close friend, the Red Sox\u2019 president, Sam Kennedy. On Friday, at Fenway, he chatted with Boston Manager John Farrell, signed autographs and talked with Red Sox employees during batting practice. He did not wear his latest World Series ring \u2014 \u201cI wore the only ring that matters,\u201d he said, flashing his wedding band \u2014 but brought it to show his father, to whom he gave his Red Sox ring. Inevitably, Epstein gave off the air of a conquering hero returning home. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to coming back,\u201d he said, having missed the Cubs\u2019 last visit here in 2014, when his second child was about to be born. Back then, the Red Sox were reigning champions and the Cubs were in the midst of another last-place finish as Epstein\u2019s rebuilding efforts at Wrigley Field slowly took hold. \u201cThe fact that we won \u2014 obviously it feels good,\u201d Epstein said, referring to the Cubs, not the Red Sox. \u201cIt feels nice to the extent that it kind of validates my decision to try a new challenge a little bit and it wasn\u2019t a foolish thing to leave. That part feels good, but I\u2019d be happy coming back here under any circumstances.\u201d As Epstein walked to the ballpark Friday from the nearby Commonwealth Hotel, turning left on Brookline Avenue, crossing the bridge over the I-95 turnpike and turning onto Yawkey Way, the neighborhood around him was changing. Large apartment and office buildings have sprouted up south of the ballpark, and chain restaurants, bars and retail shops have proliferated. An example of how quickly gentrification has taken place is the popular Tasty Burger, which opened in 2010 in an abandoned gas station. But the land it sits on is too valuable not to develop, so Tasty Burger will relocate. \u201cAt some point soon, we\u2019ll move across the street,\u201d said Tim Garrity, who mans the bar at the restaurant. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be the same.\u201d What has not changed is the immense popularity of both teams \u2014 in a sense, they are national brands \u2014 and that was reflected in how many Cubs fans found their way into Fenway on Friday night. Among them were Mike Trafton and his wife, Melissa. Mike, dressed in a vintage Ernie Banks uniform, recalled going home from school and watching the Cubs on television with his grandfather. It was a bonding experience that Red Sox fans old enough to remember the frustrating days before 2004 can appreciate. Another Cubs fan, Eric Draut, pointed out that just as the Red Sox had Bill Buckner, the first baseman who infamously let a ground ball go through his legs in the 1986 World Series, the Cubs had Leon Durham, who did the same thing in the final game of the 1984 National League Championship Series. But those days, if not quite forgotten, no longer seem to weigh so heavily. In fact, they have led to the inevitable question for Epstein: If he was able to turn around two of the most enduring losers in American sports and make them champions, what can\u2019t he do? Fortune Magazine recently called Epstein the world\u2019s greatest leader. And David Axelrod, the former adviser to President Barack Obama \u2014 and a die-hard Cubs fan who has befriended Epstein \u2014 recently told Politico that Epstein has all the requisite qualities to run for political office except one: He does not want to. \u201cI think as soon as he gets that call, he\u2019s immediately changing his number,\u201d Axelrod told the website. Epstein, speaking at a charity event earlier Friday, said he had laughed at the Politico article, according to The Boston Globe. At Fenway Park later, he expressed gratitude for the chance to head the Cubs and the Red Sox. Just as he lived within walking distance of Fenway Park, he does so in Wrigleyville, too. \u201cYou come to a place with this kind of history, this kind of ballpark, these kind of passionate fans \u2014 it enhances the entire experience,\u201d Epstein said of Boston. \u201cPeople care more. The wins and losses matter more. You know people are talking about what happened in the eighth inning at the dinner table along with: \u2018Hey, how was your day at school? How was your day at work?\u2019\u201d Epstein said Chicago had the same level of passion. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could go anywhere else, a run-of-the-mill baseball market, and work, because it would probably feel like work,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Boston and Chicago, it doesn\u2019t feel like work.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/baseball/theo-epstein-chicago-cubs-boston-red-sox.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T20:57:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T20:56:11-04:00", "abstract": "Epstein, the architect of the Red Sox\u2019 championship in 2004, was back at Fenway for the first time since he left in frustration after the 2011 season.", "title": "Theo Epstein, Conquering Hero, Returns With Chicago Cubs to Fenway Park"}
