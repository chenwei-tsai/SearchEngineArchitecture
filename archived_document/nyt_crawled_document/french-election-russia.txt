As it happens, Mr. Fillon\u2019s lead in the polls existed only in a world of alternative facts shared by the French-language service of Sputnik, a state-funded Russian news operation with the motto \u201cTelling the Untold.\u201d For weeks, Sputnik and a second Russian outfit, the new French-language arm of RT, a Kremlin-funded television station, have published reports that critics characterized as \u201cTelling the Untrue\u201d but that fans welcomed as a breath of contrarian fresh air. The broader question as France charges toward the first round of the presidential election on Sunday, however, is what exactly lies behind what looks to many, particularly supporters of the liberal front-runner, Emmanuel Macron, like a replay of Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election in the United States last year. Is Moscow meddling covertly, as American intelligence agencies say it did before Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory? Or is it just benefiting from a network of politicians, journalists and others in France who share the Kremlin\u2019s views on politics there, and much else besides? Whatever the answer, squalls of fake news reports and a barrage of hacking attacks on the computers of Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign have left many in France \u2014 and Washington \u2014 with an unnerving sense of familiarity. It all looks so recognizable that Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, recently said, \u201cI think it\u2019s safe by everybody\u2019s judgment that the Russians are actively involved in the French elections.\u201d Stung by criticism that its services turbocharged the spread of fake news during the United States election campaign, Facebook announced last week that a drive to purge \u201cinauthentic activity\u201d had led it to \u201ctake action against over 30,000 fake accounts\u201d in France. It is also clear, however, that Russia often does not so much intrude as amplify existing voices with which it agrees, notably on Syria, the perils of American power and the futility of economic sanctions on Moscow. Nataliya Novikova, who leads Sputnik in Paris, said that its operations there, while eager to present Russia\u2019s take on events, did not serve Moscow but rather a French audience eager for a \u201cdifferent angle.\u201d Complaining that Mr. Macron and members of his staff had repeatedly ignored interview requests, she said that Sputnik tried to represent all points of view and had been unfairly branded a Russian bullhorn. \u201cThere are many different truths,\u201d Ms. Novikova said. \u201cThere has to be a pluralism of truth.\u201d C\u00e9cile Vaissi\u00e9, a professor of Russian, Soviet and post-Soviet studies at the University of Rennes 2, said the Kremlin, building on methods and contacts developed in the Soviet Union, had assembled a \u201cformidable machine of influence\u201d in France that works to promote its interests as well as those of its preferred candidates. Russia, or at least its state-controlled news media, has been backing two horses in the French race. One is Mr. Fillon, who, while prime minister from 2007 to 2012, struck up a friendship with Vladimir V. Putin, who is said to have sent the French politician a bottle of wine after the death of his mother. Among the accusations of financial impropriety engulfing Mr. Fillon\u2019s campaign is that he received $50,000 from a Lebanese businessman in return for arranging a meeting with Mr. Putin. The Kremlin dismissed the report as \u201cfake news.\u201d Lately, Mr. Fillon has seen a bump in real opinion polls. They still put Mr. Macron in the lead, but the race is tight enough now that the final result, like those of the British referendum on leaving the European Union and the American presidential election, may defy the forecasts of pollsters. Russia\u2019s other preferred candidate is Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front party who traveled to Moscow last month for a meeting with Mr. Putin, whom she openly admires. Her party, traditionally hostile to the United States and the European Union, has received millions of dollars in loans from Russian banks. Mr. Macron, on the other hand, is the most enthusiastically pro-European Union candidate in the race, and Russia has been seeking to undermine and divide the union. Unlike in America, where attitudes toward Moscow formed during the Cold War often continue to hobble Russian efforts at public outreach, France has numerous individuals and organizations that speak out for views that mirror Russia\u2019s \u2014 and its preferences for the French election. Russia\u2019s influence machine, said Ms. Vaissi\u00e9, the Rennes professor, has been fueled in large part by \u201cthe paradox at the heart of our political discourse: a fascination with the United States and a permanent rejection of it that provides absolutely fertile ground for the Russians.\u201d Anti-Americanism in France has seeped deep into the center-right, encouraging an infatuation among some politicians with Russia and Mr. Putin that has provided Russian news outlets in France with some of their most bombastic pro-Russia and anti-Macron voices. One of those is Nicolas Dhuicq, a member of Parliament, secretary of the legislature\u2019s France-Russia Friendship Group and a member of the board of the French-Russian Dialogue Association, an organization stacked with pillars of the French establishment and led by an old political ally of Mr. Putin\u2019s. It was Mr. Dhuicq who told Sputnik in February that Mr. Macron was a closet homosexual supported by a \u201cvery rich gay lobby.\u201d The claim, which set off a firestorm on social media, put Mr. Macron briefly on the defensive. The furor quickly fizzled, however, after the allegation was ridiculed by the candidate and the mainstream news media as a transparent exercise in the dark Russian art of \u201ckompromat,\u201d or using compromising information to embarrass or hinder. Mr. Dhuicq also contributed to a Sputnik article that derided Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, as a \u201cU.S. agent lobbying banks\u2019 interests.\u201d In an interview, Mr. Dhuicq stood by his claim that Mr. Macron had a secret double life and scoffed at allegations of Russian meddling as fantasy driven by paranoia imported from America. \u201cI trained as a psychiatrist and know what paranoia looks like,\u201d he said. The Russians \u201care clever enough to know their influence is close to zero on French voters,\u201d he added. \u201cMost people don\u2019t even know what Sputnik is.\u201d It is true that very few people read or watch Russian news coverage in French, but what those outlets say gets recycled on social media. Once there, the Russian source often gets stripped away, allowing raw kompromat to churn through blogs, on Twitter and on what Mr. Macron\u2019s supporters call the \u201cfascisphere\u201d of anti-establishment and often extreme-right websites. \u201cThe American phenomenon is being repeated here in France,\u201d said Pierre Haski, a founder of the liberal news site Rue89. \u201cA large section of the population has broken with the mainstream media and gets its information from parallel sources. This is the world in which RT and Sputnik have found their place.\u201d Sputnik\u2019s report about Mr. Fillon\u2019s surge in opinion polls, based on research by a company based in Moscow that studies social media, got some traction online but never really took off \u2014 in part because of a swift rebuke from a French watchdog that monitors polling claims. Using information from the same Moscow company, Sputnik again declared \u201cFillon the favorite in the presidential race\u201d on Friday, but this time it made clear the assertion was not based on polling data. Mounir Mahjoubi, digital director of the Macron campaign, said the principal goals of the state-funded Russian media outlets were to spread chaos and uncertainty and to undermine Mr. Macron while diverting attention from Mr. Fillon\u2019s legal troubles. In one striking example, Sputnik and RT reported in February \u2014 citing what they said was an interview by the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, with the newspaper Izvestia \u2014 that WikiLeaks had \u201cinteresting information\u201d about Mr. Macron and was preparing to release it. \u201cAssange will pour oil on the fire of the French election campaign,\u201d RT reported. But a spokesman for WikiLeaks said that Mr. Assange had never given such an interview and had merely sent a short email responding to a question from an Izvestia reporter. Murkier still are the thousands of cyberstrikes against the Macron campaign\u2019s website and hundreds of attempts to gain access to its email accounts through so-called phishing attacks. The same tactic was used to gain entry to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers last year. Yet Damien Bancal, a French journalist who founded and runs the website Zataz, which focuses on digital security, said that attributing such activities to Russia was wild conjecture. The Macron campaign\u2019s computer system \u201cis like a Swiss cheese,\u201d he said, open to attack not only by Russia but also by \u201cany 15-year-old with a computer.\u201d The government has nonetheless taken the danger seriously, with Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault warning Moscow that \u201cthis kind of interference in French political life is unacceptable,\u201d and the country\u2019s equivalent of the National Security Council in Washington holding a special meeting to discuss cyberthreats. Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris said he doubted that any Russian efforts, whatever their nature, would have much impact on the election. While at times highly skilled at planting false information and creating confusion, \u201cthey often burn themselves while trying to burn down the house,\u201d he said.", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00"}
