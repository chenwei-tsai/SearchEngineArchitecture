{"text": "At least five people were killed in Texas on Saturday afternoon when a series of tornadoes tore through rural counties east of Dallas, the authorities said. The tornadoes touched down around 5 p.m. and left a broad trail of damage, tossing cars, knocking down trees and power lines, and flattening homes. The city of Canton and the surrounding area in Van Zandt County, about 60 miles east of Dallas, appeared to be the hardest hit. Capt. Brian Horton of the Canton Fire Department said late Saturday that five people had been killed and dozens were injured. \u201cWhat we do know is that it is very severe,\u201d Captain Horton said at a news conference. He said some people remain unaccounted for and that search-and-rescue teams from across Texas were on their way to assist. The death toll will most likely rise on Sunday, when the authorities are better able to survey the damage, Captain Horton said. Scores of people from the counties of Van Zandt, Henderson and Rains were taken to hospitals in East Texas. A spokeswoman for the East Texas Medical Center Regional Healthcare System said its hospitals received 55 patients, but only one person was in critical condition. \u201cWe still have ambulances from our hospital as well as other systems that are on the scene tonight,\u201d the hospital spokeswoman, Rebecca Berkley, said. \u201cOne of our helicopters is helping tonight and landing and doing searches.\u201d A school in Canton and another in the city of Fruitvale were set up as triage centers to accept injured people, the authorities said. The National Weather Service reported that three tornadoes touched down. The tornado that hit Canton appeared to start southwest of the city and traveled more than 40 miles northeast to Emory.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/east-texas-tornadoes-canton-van-zandt.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T01:43:08-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T01:43:08-04:00", "abstract": "Three tornadoes touched down east of Dallas, flipping cars, knocking down trees and destroying homes, the authorities said.", "title": "At Least 5 Are Killed in Tornadoes in East Texas"}
