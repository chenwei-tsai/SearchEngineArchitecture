{"text": "She scurried up the Met Gala red carpet so quickly that if you blinked you probably missed her. She did not stand for two hours on the receiving line with some of the evening\u2019s glittering co-hosts, among them Anna Wintour, Katy Perry and Tom Brady. And for a while, the guest of honor was quipping that she might skip the Monday night event altogether. And yet, a little after 7 p.m., there was the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons designer Rei Kawakubo huddled near the entrance of the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Exhibition Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, dressed in a slightly spruced-up version of her everyday outfit (her usual black leather motorcycle jacket swapped for a white one, a silver tiara perched on her trademark bob), and not only receiving the congratulations of well-wishers like Bruce Weber and the 10 Corso Como retailer Carla Sozzani, but also posing gamely for a few pictures. Ms. Kawakubo is shy to the point of reclusive, quiet to the point of absent, and indifferent to the celebrities other designers court. Who are, naturally, just the people who came flooding into the Met for a gala opening that is New York\u2019s biggest social night of the year and which, this time, raised more than $12 million for the Costume Institute. Andrew Bolton, the exhibition\u2019s curator, looked happy and relieved, not least by the good reaction from his subject. \u201cThere\u2019s been a change over the last few days,\u201d he said, his partner, Thom Browne, alongside. \u201cI think she\u2019s almost enjoying it.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlmost.\u201d Meanwhile, around the serene-looking Ms. Kawakubo, guests circled the galleries wonderingly. Mr. Weber, who shot some memorable Comme des Gar\u00e7ons mailers in the 1980s, had brought his camera and was snapping away; Rick Owens, with his wife, Mich\u00e8le Lamy, one of the few brave and chic enough to wear Comme, were looking around in awe. Ms. Kawakubo\u2019s creations are not for the faint of heart. \u201cI wear it so conservatively,\u201d said Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, the creative director and longtime Comme collaborator, who was wearing a large dress from Ms. Kawakubo\u2019s \u201cInvisible Clothes\u201d collection, crowned with a headband studded with spikes. It, too, was by Ms. Kawakubo. For men. The others who did \u2014 including Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Tracee Ellis Ross, Stella Tennant, Anna Cleveland and Caroline Kennedy \u2014 looked marvelous. Ms. Ross, in a high-collared floral Comme des Gar\u00e7ons coatdress, said she had been a fan for years. \u201cIt\u2019s the merging of art and fashion in a way that pushed the boundaries,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just everything to me. And I can do this!\u201d She ducked her head into the high collar of her coat, like a glamorous turtle in retreat. \u201cI think I did it on the red carpet.\u201d Mindy Kaling, who was working her way through the exhibition with Gary Ross, her director on \u201cOcean\u2019s Eight,\u201d said she was also a fan, \u201calthough I must say I feel only bold enough to wear separates and perfume and accessories.\u201d She is also the veteran of previous Met Galas, real and fictionalized. The gala is featured in \u201cOcean\u2019s Eight,\u201d and the cast spent 10 days filming at the museum. \u201cI staged my own,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cNow I\u2019m seeing theirs as a civilian. I find it much more relaxing to be a civilian than have to direct. It\u2019s fun to be here.\u201d Part of the fun is the people-watching, which is heady. Once upon a time, the Met Gala was a smaller, more socialite-driven event (\u201cYou look even lovelier than when you first came,\u201d a courtly older gentleman told Carolina Herrera, the designer and perennial social fixture), but now, free-range stars mingle and kibitz. Laura Dern, dressed by and on the arm of the designer Gabriela Hearst, was about to weigh in on the exhibition when she was interrupted by her \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d co-star, Alexander Skarsgard, who played a villainous husband of Monterey, Calif., in the mini-series. \u201cLook at this lovely man!\u201d Ms. Dern exclaimed. \u201cNow everybody\u2019s scared of him.\u201d Mr. Skarsgard said: \u201cI\u2019ve been in the woods for two months and I got back two days ago. I haven\u2019t even seen the show. I got back and people are like, \u2018Ooh \u2026 no.\u201d He laughed. \u201cSo I\u2019ll never work again. But we had a good time.\u201d Downstairs, in the Petrie sculpture court, where cocktails were served, the celebrity swell was growing. Here and there were a few CDG touches, like the \u201cLive Free Die Strong Comme des Gar\u00e7ons\u201d jacket that the Oscar de la Renta and Monse designer Laura Kim had over her dress, or the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Play heart logo patch that Ms. Kim had removed from one of her T-shirts and stitched on to her co-designer Fernando Garcia\u2019s tuxedo. (\u201cI\u2019m going to put it back tomorrow,\u201d she said.) With them was Zo\u00eb Kravitz, in a blush-pink Oscar de la Renta gown with a bodice of real, preserved roses. She wasn\u2019t wearing Comme, but she still had one of the night\u2019s savviest reviews: Comme is \u201cso modern and feminine and weird,\u201d she said. \u201cExactly what fashion should be.\u201d Serena Williams, pregnant and glowing in a green gown by Atelier Versace (\u201cI feel good,\u201d she said), was catching up with her old friend Vera Wang. Were they Comme fans? \u201cI\u2019ve actually never worked with them,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cBut I love their stuff. It\u2019s so forward, so fashion. It\u2019s something you\u2019re really inspired by.\u201d Ms. Wang is not only an admirer; \u201cI\u2019m a client, too!\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s even better. Fully participating, all the way. For a long time, too.\u201d But as the throng grew denser, most guests seemed blithely unaware of Ms. Kawakubo and her small retinue in a corner, just as she would probably prefer. Selena Gomez and Abel Tesfaye (a.k.a. the Weeknd) were holding hands by the bar. Eddie Redmayne was deep in conversation with a Dior-beret-topped Isabelle Huppert. Trevor Noah and Hasan Minhaj, the latter fresh from the White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner, were chatting up Aziz Ansari and Judd Apatow; Stephen Colbert made a dash past the crowd up a side colonnade. A drummer sounded the call for dinner, but with the highest-profile attendees (Nicki Minaj and Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and Madonna) still outside on the red carpet, the procession moved slowly. All the better opportunity for a few straggling fans whose tickets were cocktail-only to take in the sight of Roger Federer, the tennis champion and longtime favorite of Ms. Wintour\u2019s, in a Gucci tuxedo whose jacket back was elaborately bedazzled with a rearing cobra. He was perfectly game to pose for photos. \u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone is taking a photo of the back for a change.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/fashion/met-gala-rei-kawakubo-comme-des-garcons.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T17:05:25-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T17:05:25-04:00", "abstract": "At the party of the year, the guest of honor was a somewhat elusive presence.", "title": "At the Met Gala, Paying Homage to Rei Kawakubo"}
