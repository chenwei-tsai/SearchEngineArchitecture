{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With an eye to President Obama\u2019s legacy and his own, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew on Wednesday will hail the success of economic sanctions against Iran and other global offenders, but warn that their overuse could threaten the primacy of the United States and the dollar in the world economy. In his prepared remarks and in an interview, Mr. Lew also answered criticism from Congress and the Republican presidential candidates who oppose the Iran deal and the lifting of international sanctions that was part of it. He warned that if the United States had failed to respond as the agreement called for after Iran dismantled its weapons infrastructure, it would have lost credibility in threatening sanctions in the future against other bad actors to change their behavior. \u201cIf you were sitting in Tehran now, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily feel like you\u2019d gotten very much relief,\u201d Mr. Lew said in the interview this week. \u201cWe have to be very attentive to keeping our part of the bargain if we want others to do the things that we\u2019re trying to use sanctions to create the pressure for them to do.\u201d Both in his speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and in the interview, Mr. Lew acknowledged the difficulty of relieving Iranians of nuclear-related sanctions given their other offenses \u2014 support for terrorism and human rights violations \u2014 that have provoked separate sanctions by both the United States and its allies. The nuclear sanctions were included in four United Nations resolutions during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, and supplemented by separate American financial sanctions. \u201cEconomic sanctions have become a powerful force in service of clear and coordinated foreign policy objectives \u2014 smart power for situations where diplomacy alone is insufficient, but military force is not the right response,\u201d Mr. Lew says in his prepared remarks. But their effectiveness has spurred demands for more sanctions, including from Congress, outside groups and other nations, and he warned, according to the speech text, \u201cWe must be conscious of the risk that overuse of sanctions could undermine our leadership position within the global economy, and the effectiveness of the sanctions themselves. \u201cIf they make the business environment too complicated or unpredictable, or if they excessively interfere with the flow of funds worldwide, financial transactions may begin to move outside of the United States entirely, which could threaten the central role of the U.S. financial system globally, not to mention the effectiveness of our sanctions in the future.\u201d While Mr. Lew does not refer specifically to China, its rise has spawned speculation that it could someday displace the United States as the pre-eminent financial power, and its renminbi could replace the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency, though few see that as likely anytime soon. Mr. Lew said the most important lesson to be drawn from the past use of sanctions was the desirability of acting in concert with allies: \u201cThe more international support there is for sanctions and their underlying objective, the more effective they will be.\u201d As examples, he cited the sanctions on Iran and those imposed on Russia because of its intervention in Ukraine, as well as a recent international agreement on expanded sanctions against North Korea that includes China, its longtime ally. Sanctions, he added, should be viewed not as \u201cpunishment for past actions\u201d but as pressure to change future actions, by holding out the promise of sanctions relief. And, Mr. Lew said, the United States must continue to invest money in a sanctions infrastructure \u2014 investigators, analysts, monitors and lawyers \u2014 together with businesses, banks and foreign governments and institutions. Ahead of Mr. Lew\u2019s speech, experts from recent administrations echoed his message on the danger of overreliance on sanctions, as effective as they can be. \u201cHe\u2019s reacting to some real pressures,\u201d said Juan C. Zarate, a former counterterrorism adviser to President George W. Bush and the author of a 2013 book, \u201cTreasury\u2019s War,\u201d on financial weapons developed since Sept. 11, 2001. \u201cOne is the desire to continuously use these measures for each and every crisis in a maximalist way,\u201d by Congress, foreign governments and interest groups, Mr. Zarate said. \u201cBut he\u2019s also seen that there is pressure from the private sector\u201d for prudence. Nicholas Burns, a career diplomat who served in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and drafted the first sanctions against Iran under Mr. Bush, said sanctions \u201chave been used much more intensively in the last 10 to 15 years than they had been before. And I\u2019m a proponent because it does give you an option other than military.\u201d Mr. Burns added: \u201cBut you do have to ask the question, Can they be overused? And you have to be careful when you exact sanctions that they actually work. Because if they don\u2019t work, then you\u2019re not credible.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/us/politics/lew-defends-sanctions-but-cautions-on-overuse.html", "published_date": "2016-03-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:10-04:00", "abstract": "Treasury Secretary Jacob J.
