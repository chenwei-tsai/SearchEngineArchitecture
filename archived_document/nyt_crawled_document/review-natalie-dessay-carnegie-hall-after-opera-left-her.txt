{"text": "I didn\u2019t spot Ren\u00e9e Fleming at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday. But she would have been heartened by Natalie Dessay\u2019s recital. Here was a beloved soprano, like Ms. Fleming \u2014 and who, like Ms. Fleming, is now shifting from the opera to the concert stage \u2014 who still sounded recognizably herself yet was still challenging herself, and who was still deliriously received by her fans. Ms. Fleming, 58, and Ms. Dessay, 52, faced the same problem over the past decade or so. Their voices didn\u2019t much darken or deepen in their 40s, leaving them basically stranded in the ing\u00e9nue roles they\u2019d been singing since they were young. This was a particular frustration for Ms. Dessay, whose specialty was cute, spunky girls whose vocal lines exploded into stratospheric coloratura, the likes of Zerbinetta in Strauss\u2019s \u201cAriadne auf Naxos.\u201d Even if your voice holds up, you seem increasingly silly playing Zerbinetta as a 50- or 60-year-old \u2014 especially if, like Ms. Dessay, you place more than the usual operatic emphasis on your theatrical bona fides. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m leaving opera,\u201d she told the newspaper Le Figaro in 2013, during her final run as Massenet\u2019s Manon. \u201cIt\u2019s that opera is leaving me.\u201d When opera leaves you, what\u2019s left? For Ms. Dessay, it has been tours with the French pop and film composer Michel Legrand and some straight theater. Musicals, too. In 2014, she was Madame Emery in a semi-staged version of \u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\u201d and has played the obsessive Fosca in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cPassion.\u201d (Ms. Fleming will follow that lead, appearing next season in a Broadway production of \u201cCarousel.\u201d) In \u201cPictures of America,\u201d a recording released last year, Ms. Dessay attempted a silky Streisand-style float in standards like \u201cOn a Clear Day\u201d and \u201cSend in the Clowns.\u201d But she hasn\u2019t abandoned classical music: A new album of Schubert songs features intriguingly if unremittingly stark interpretations. She made a better impression in some of those songs at Carnegie, with full-bodied collaboration from the pianist Philippe Cassard. Live, the vulnerable yet indomitable persona Ms. Dessay likes to present \u2014 that of a victim giving testimony \u2014 rounds into a complete, often riveting performance a voice that, when recorded, can come off chilly and charmless. So this was \u201cGretchen am Spinnrade\u201d as despairing cry, the \u201cLied der Mignon\u201d as haunted litany. In \u201cDie Junge Nonne,\u201d her whitened tone in the line \u201cFinster die nacht wie das grab\u201d (\u201cThe night is as dark as the grave\u201d) conjured a whole world of fear. The intensity rarely lifted: an admirable consistency of mood, though a consistency achieved at the expense of possibilities for variety. There wasn\u2019t much individuality in each of Pfitzner\u2019s eight rarely done \u201cAlte Weisen\u201d songs, depictions of women from youth to old age. Bizet\u2019s \u201cAdieux de l\u2019H\u00f4tesse Arabe\u201d felt drab, without a range of vocal colors, and the \u201cJewel Song,\u201d from Gounod\u2019s \u201cFaust,\u201d radiated clenched-teeth determination rather than sparkle. Much of Ms. Dessay\u2019s voice remains almost eerily preserved \u2014 clean, pointed, penetrating. Called upon for soft, hovering high notes, the decades melted away. But the touch of nasality, of wiry acid, that was always around the edges of her instrument has spread: She is a passionate artist who casts a memorable spell, but she is not always pure pleasure to listen to. While I could do without some of her trying-too-hard touches \u2014 the wide-eyed peering, the self-consciously sensual sinuous arm motions \u2014 she manages to pull off some potentially campy ideas. She left the stage so Mr. Cassard could play a couple of Debussy solos, and I was ready to roll my eyes as she floated back on like a sleepwalker as he finished the final bars of \u201cOndine\u201d and began, without pause, the opening of Debussy\u2019s song \u201cRegret.\u201d But her commitment made the moment persuasive. And in the death aria from Delibes\u2019s \u201cLakm\u00e9,\u201d her fourth and final encore, she produced what I can only describe as a voice within her voice, faint yet true, emerging as if across time and space.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/music/review-natalie-dessay-carnegie-hall-after-opera-left-her.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:31:43-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:30:26-04:00", "abstract": "The French soprano, recently retired from staged opera, gave a recital at Carnegie Hall that showed off the intensity of her acting.", "title": "Review: Natalie Dessay, After Opera Left Her"}
