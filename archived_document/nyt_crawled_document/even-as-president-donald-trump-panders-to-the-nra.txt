{"text": "President Trump eagerly repaid his campaign debt to the National Rifle Association on Friday by appearing at its annual convention in Atlanta. Last year, candidate Trump benefited greatly from the N.R.A.\u2019s endorsement and $30 million worth of campaign support; the N.R.A., in turn, relished Mr. Trump\u2019s fear-inducing agenda, which led to greater arms sales among more and more ordinary Americans. Interestingly, however, now that Mr. Trump\u2019s in the White House, gun sales have been leveling off, gun company stocks are dropping and industry workers are being laid off. One reason is that President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have departed the political scene, thereby depriving gun marketeers and the N.R.A. of the selling point that caused an eight-year binge of gun sales to buyers who feared tight new regulations. And binge it was, with the industry growing from 166,000 employees to 301,000 in the Obama years, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. But since the election, \u201cthere is no political incentive to buy guns,\u201d Robert Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York at Cortland, told CNN Money, leaving gun makers and retailers \u201ca victim of their own success.\u201d Americans concerned for public safety can only hope that the decline will continue as the nation\u2019s gun carnage seems likely to produce another year of 30,000-plus deaths. Mr. Trump himself has displayed no sense of responsibility to offer prescriptions for how that toll might be reduced through gun safety. Rather, in his appearance Friday, he stuck to the red-meat stuff expected at a convention where hundreds of companies displayed an astonishing 15 acres of guns and firearms paraphernalia for thousands of conventioneers. \u201cYou came through for me and I am going to come through for you,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, as gun owners cheered. Exactly how he might do that remains to be seen, although the president pointed to his decision to ease federal restrictions against the use of lead bullets on federal hunting grounds. Lead ammunition remnants prove highly toxic in the animal food chain and had been restricted. Beyond that, Mr. Trump did not touch on such N.R.A. priorities as the gun lobby\u2019s push in Congress to expand its \u201cconcealed carry\u201d campaign of gun ownership by requiring states to recognize different gun permits issued in other states. This is currently the gun industry\u2019s main hope for a sales rebound \u2014 weakening permit laws to see more guns in more people\u2019s pockets in more public places. Gun safety research indicates concealed-carry gun owners are responsible for far more homicides and suicides than self-defense standoffs against criminals. But Mr. Trump, who used to favor strong gun controls, has endorsed the N.R.A.\u2019s vigilante approach as a safety measure. \u201cIf I\u2019m in that room and let\u2019s say we have two or five or 40 people with guns,\u201d he hypothesized as a candidate, \u201cwe\u2019re going to do a lot better because there\u2019s going to be a shootout.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/opinion/even-as-president-donald-trump-panders-to-the-nra.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T14:30:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "created_date": "2017-04-29T14:30:16-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Trump served up red meat to conventioneers, feeding the fear that sustains the gun lobby.", "title": "Even as President, Donald Trump Panders to the N.R.A."}
