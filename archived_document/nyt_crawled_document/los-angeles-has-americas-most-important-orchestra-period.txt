{"abstract": "Our critic finds that an inspiring leader has left the Los Angeles Philharmonic in peerless artistic shape.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 On Saturday I went to a symphony hall and had an experience unlike any I\u2019ve had before. At 11:30 p.m., a couple thousand people stood and cheered for the lush and loud art-rock band Sigur Ros. Many had filed into Walt Disney Concert Hall here nearly five hours earlier, for some new chamber works from Iceland, ending with the final piece fading away, faint strings mingling with the players\u2019 gentle humming. During the evening, the Los Angeles Philharmonic joined Sigur Ros for a set, and the orchestra on its own played both a very recent work and a mad rarity from 1930, Jon Leifs\u2019s roaring Organ Concerto. Oh, and there was an a cappella choir, too. The marathon evening was the climax of the Philharmonic\u2019s two-week Reykjavik Festival, an exploration of the cross-genre pollinations burbling along in Iceland of late. But with five shows in one, Saturday\u2019s concert felt like a festival unto itself. Sprawling and exhausting, a mix of old and new, pop and classical, amazing and good and well-intentioned-but-sigh-not-so-great, it summed up the L.A. Phil, as the orchestra is universally known, in all its inimitably ambitious glory. \u201cThe ascendancy of the Los Angeles Philharmonic is the salient event in American orchestral life of the past 25 years,\u201d Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker a few weeks ago. I\u2019d go further: The Los Angeles Philharmonic is the most important orchestra in America. Period. As it prepares to celebrate its centennial in 2019, the Philharmonic puts more energy into new work than any other orchestra. It presents a greater sense of the diversity of today\u2019s music and its creators than any other orchestra. It ties its mission to education and social justice in its city more than any other orchestra. And, yes, more than any other orchestra, it combines a commitment to the future with a fresh eye on the past. Why is all this worth mentioning just now? Because the Philharmonic is facing an unexpected and not altogether welcome transition. Deborah Borda, the leader who guided an already daring institution to new heights over the past 17 years, announced last month that she was leaving to try and work some magic on the struggling New York Philharmonic. In Los Angeles, Ms. Borda completed the soaring Frank Gehry-designed Disney Hall, which had been languishing before her arrival; gave new vigor to the Hollywood Bowl, owned by the orchestra and now a reliable cash cow; quintupled the endowment; and hired Gustavo Dudamel as music director when he was a fledgling and made him a star. With orchestra subscription bases faltering, Ms. Borda\u2019s Los Angeles Philharmonic rethought its season as a series of events and festivals, each night needing to stand on its own, to sell itself. Going through the calendar for next season and marking the events I don\u2019t just want to see but feel I really need to see \u2014 the ones I would fly across the country for in a heartbeat \u2014 I ended up with more than 10. A lot of that is contemporary work, major new projects from Annie Gosfield, Andrew Norman, Ted Hearne, Esa-Pekka Salonen and other composers I cherish; another pop-classical festival, this one devoted to Mexico. But not all: Leonard Bernstein\u2019s \u201cChichester Psalms\u201d as a curtain raiser for Beethoven\u2019s Ninth? Bruch\u2019s Concerto for Two Pianos? A Peter Sellars staging of \u201cDas Paradies und die Peri\u201d to close a Schumann cycle? Sign me up. As Mr. Ross wrote in The New Yorker, when it comes to creativity and diversity, the orchestra is mainly competing with itself. While Ms. Borda\u2019s new orchestra in New York has dived gamely into contemporary pieces and the occasional theatrical presentation under its departing music director, Alan Gilbert, both Contact!, its perpetually wilting new-music series, and its NY Phil Biennial of fresh work have lacked Los Angeles\u2019 exuberant focus. Every orchestra delves into canonical composers like Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, but the New York ensemble\u2019s festivals don\u2019t range any further. David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center, in its current bland-shoebox form, doesn\u2019t inspire unconventional thinking, as Disney Hall does; many of the New York Philharmonic\u2019s exciting offerings take place outside its stodgy home. And the future holds worries: New York\u2019s next conductor, Jaap van Zweden, has made his name with vigorous, even pushy renditions of the standards, not with unusual ideas about repertory or eagerness to reconsider the very nature of the orchestra. (To be fair, when he arrived in Los Angeles Mr. Dudamel wasn\u2019t known for his originality, either.) Not everything is perfect here in California, of course \u2014 not even the Reykjavik Festival, clearly conceived with love by Chad Smith, the orchestra\u2019s programming prodigy; the composer Daniel Bjarnason; and Mr. Salonen, Mr. Dudamel\u2019s predecessor at the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s podium. When it accompanied Sigur Ros, the orchestra was mostly swamped by a band that\u2019s already symphonic in its blossoming sweep. And though the band\u2019s layering of velvety noise and Jonsi Birgisson\u2019s ethereal wail is always alluring, a little elegiac ache goes a long way. The less said, the better about the concert on Monday evening that ended the festival proper. (\u201cBj\u00f6rk Digital,\u201d a VR video extravaganza that sounds suspiciously similar to part of that gamin pop star\u2019s woeful 2015 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, has been tacked on, May 19 to June 4.) When Mr. Ross tweeted his piece about the orchestra\u2019s ascendancy, someone replied: \u201cProgramming trendy trance & cultish minimalists doesn\u2019t make an orchestra \u2018great\u2019 by pandering to a dumbed-down audience.\u201d This comment caught my eye just hours after Monday\u2019s program, which was like that sour sentiment, come to life. The first half offered a genial but dully messy immersion in the musicians\u2019 collective that has sprung up around the Icelandic record label Bedroom Community, founded in 2006 by the composer and producer Valgeir Sigurdsson. The second half, slicker but emptier, found Johann Johannsson, best known for his film scores, joined by members of the ensemble ACME in an unbroken hour-plus of defanged Muzak-Minimalism. You win some, you lose some. That\u2019s to be expected when it comes to art. What\u2019s more surprising is the one element missing from America\u2019s most innovative orchestra: Where is the digital access to what it creates? Those of us who can\u2019t be in Los Angeles every weekend want \u2014 we need! \u2014 a record of the remarkable things going on here. The Detroit Symphony Orchestra, its budget a quarter of the Philharmonic\u2019s, was forced to rethink its musicians\u2019 contract in the wake of a strike a few years ago and now is more or less the only American orchestra with a real platform for webcasting and archiving its performances. Will the West Coast follow the Rust Belt on this one? I hope so. It tells you everything you need to know about the Los Angeles Philharmonic that I\u2019m so desperate to hear it.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/arts/music/los-angeles-has-americas-most-important-orchestra-period.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T16:28:23-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Los Angeles Has America\u2019s Most Important Orchestra.
