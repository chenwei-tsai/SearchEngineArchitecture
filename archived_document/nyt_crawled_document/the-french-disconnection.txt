In both casual conversation and specialized coverage, in France, Europe and elsewhere, the answer to that question is often amazingly presumptuous: Ms. Le Pen will make it to the second round of the election, but she won\u2019t become president. Hardly anyone seems to contemplate the possibility of her winning outright, with a simple majority, in the first round of voting this Sunday. Most polls promise the reassuring prospect of a final duel. Why? Some analysts point to the heavy political baggage she has inherited from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who led the far-right National Front party before her. Others invoke various mathematical impossibilities. In any event, \u201cMarine Le Pen will not be president\u201d \u2014 the idea has become commonplace, a kind of political verse, a comfortable mental habit. But it masks a peculiar form of denial no one wants to recognize as a potentially terrible mistake. And it leads to this contradiction: Even as the mainstream discusses the need to mobilize against a Le Pen presidency \u2014 with a \u201cvote utile,\u201d or tactical vote \u2014 it dismisses the very possibility that she might win, especially in the aftermath of a fatal shooting of a policeman on Thursday on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility. This paradox is partly the result of the happy memory left by the 2002 presidential election. In the first round that year, Mr. Le Pen routed Lionel Jospin, the Socialist candidate, by taking advantage of the left\u2019s state of general disarray. But the ensuing face-off between Mr. Le Pen and Jacques Chirac, of the mainstream right, turned into a display of force by the proponents of French pluralism: Many different camps \u2014 the right, the center, the left, the far left \u2014 rallied to give Mr. Chirac a crushing victory. There were vast demonstrations then, and they consecrated the aesthetics of a republican front that had come together against the far right. They also created a mythology about how a citizenry could mobilize. Today\u2019s denial is a result. The far right is now seen as a counterweight, but still not as a main player. It charts the terrain of political discourse, establishes what issues will be debated and gives voice to people\u2019s anxieties. But that won\u2019t go any further, or so it is said. The National Front exists to arouse fear, not to govern. This idea also proceeds from the simplistic portrayal of the putative average French voter. The bien-pensant elites see him and her as responsible citizens well aware of what rides on their votes \u2014 the \u201cnoble savages\u201d of current French politics. It\u2019s a notion as wishful as Rousseau\u2019s theory. French voters may not be that noble. Here\u2019s an example. Why else won\u2019t Ms. Le Pen become president? Because she\u2019s a woman. It\u2019s uncouth to say that, but grand political analysis is also made up of petty prejudices. France is a paradoxical country: It was a republic before its time, but it remains a monarchy after its time, in its mores, its practices and its vision of power. It would have been easier to understand how same-sex marriage could unleash such stormy debates in a conservative monarchy like Spain. But it was in France that the law was bitterly fought over before it passed, and that it became a test of certain politicians\u2019 modernism. Similarly, Ms. Le Pen has worked to appear electable by casting herself not as a woman who wants to improve the lot of women, but as a female politician who wants to save France. She talks mostly about immigrants, terrorism, Islamism, colonization and the euro. Not so much about the status of women. Meanwhile, by talking about immigrants, terrorism, Islamism, colonization and the euro in the stark terms that she favors, Ms. Le Pen has little by little lifted taboos and normalized some scandalous propositions. Populists like her realize that the best tool of propaganda isn\u2019t accuracy, but the internet and the fake. Their focus isn\u2019t truth, only effects. And it works: Voters today don\u2019t read long analyses; they remember forceful assertions. So why is it, finally, that Ms. Le Pen cannot become president? Because while the far right has changed its discourse, the mainstream elites still hold on to their old ways of seeing the world, or imagining what it is. Their analysis of the rise of populism is out of sync. It rests on assumptions, faulty reasoning and denial. The prospect of a Le Pen presidency upsets a kind of political positivism: the view that democracy can go only from good to better, from being a necessity to being a right. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s election would run counter to the course of history, the reasoning goes, and therefore it cannot be. This is a happy ending for elites: a narrative convention, a marketable concept, a variant form of utopia \u2014 and the basis of an irrational political analysis.", "abstract": "How can we be so scared Marine Le Pen might become president and yet so certain that she won\u2019t?", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T22:24:29-04:00", "title": "The French Disconnection", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/opinion/the-french-disconnection.html"}
