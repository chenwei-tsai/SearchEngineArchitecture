{"text": "Good morning.  Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 President Trump celebrated his first 100 days in office over the weekend, bathing in the applause of a crowd of his bedrock supporters, reviving themes of lawless immigrants and unfair trade deals, and lashing out at the news media. He is also adjusting his reach on the other side of the world: stunning even his staff by inviting the authoritarian president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to the White House; made similar invitations to the leaders of Singapore and Thailand; softening his tone on China; and planning to meet Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in New York on Thursday. Our reporters looked back at the first phase of the Trump presidency, from the biggest news stories to the most provocative tweets. See all of our coverage here \u2014 or just watch a two-minute video. _____ \u2022 Nearly 300 corporate executives have visited the White House this year, putting business leaders on par with senior lawmakers in influencing President Trump\u2019s thinking. The S.&P. 500 is up about 5 percent since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. But the U.S. economy grew at just 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2017, its slowest pace in three years. And the president\u2019s threats to upend  trade deals could carry their own costs. Above, Wilbur Ross, left, the U.S. commerce secretary, and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, at the White House. _____ \u2022 In the end, it appears the U.S. will pay for the Thaad missile-defense system it is installing in South Korea. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, reaffirmed the agreement after Mr. Trump set off an uproar among South Korea\u2019s presidential candidates by challenging it. Pope Francis, returning from a visit to Egypt, urged the U.S. and North Korea to avert a potentially horrific conflict. _____ \u2022 North Korea is showing surprising signs of economic vitality A merchant and entrepreneurial class is growing, amid signs that market forces are weakening the Pyongyang government\u2019s grip on society. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make money through markets, you are likely to die of hunger,\u201d a recent defector said. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201d _____ \u2022 When it comes to global fishing, China is the undisputed king of the seas. Having depleted stocks close to home, the country\u2019s growing armada of distant-water fishing vessels is heading to West Africa, where corruption and lax enforcement allow many to contravene international or national laws. \u201cWe always thought that sea life was boundless,\u201d an African fisherman said, adding that now, \u201cwe are facing a catastrophe.\u201d \u2022Traders in mainland Chinese  are behind some of the startling jumps and drops in Hong Kong\u2019s stock market. \u2022 Didi Chuxing is expected to use $5.5 billion in new funds to become an international rival to Uber. \u2022 In the latest airline fracas captured on video, a Delta pilot appeared to hit a woman while trying to halt a fight between her and another woman. \u2022 Increased demand in China has pushed avocado prices to their highest point in nearly 20 years. \u2022 Ahead this week: Apple earnings on Tuesday; the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on whether to raise interest rates on Wednesday; a possible strike by Hollywood\u2019s writers\u2019 guild. And, sometime this month, the maiden flight of China\u2019s C919 passenger jet.  \u2022 European markets, as well as many across Asia, are closed for the Labor Day holiday. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 An Asean summit meeting went easy on China, dropping references in its final statement to the country\u2019s \u201cland reclamation and militarization\u201d in the South China Sea. [Reuters] \u2022 Turkey fired nearly 4,000 more civil servants and blocked Wikipedia in an expanding crackdown on dissent and free speech. [The New York Times] \u2022 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey arrived in India with a 150-member business delegation. He will hold talks today with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. [Times of India] \u2022 China deported an U.S. businesswoman, Phan Phan-Gillis, after her conviction and sentencing on a spying charge last week. [The New York Times] \u2022 Ueli Steck, a renowned mountain climber known as the \u201cSwiss Machine,\u201d was killed in a mountaineering accident near Mount Everest. [Associated Press] \u2022 Scientists confirmed the existence of an ancient dog species \u2014 the New Guinea singing dog \u2014 in the remote mountains of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia\u2019s Papua provinces. [ABC] \u2022 China has hired more than 20,000 scholars to write an online version of its national encyclopedia to compete against Wikipedia. [South China Morning Post] \u2022 Nice people don\u2019t finish last when it comes to popularity contests. \u2022 Read a book you think you\u2019ll hate, and you\u2019ll become a better critic. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Celebrate the season with pasta primavera. \u2022 Two architects, one in Boston and another in Delhi, gave a 300-year-old farmhouse in the southern Indian state of Kerala a new life, first by taking it apart and then by moving it 1,500 miles. \u2022 In memoriam: Florence Finch, an unsung war hero. She supplied fuel to the Filipino underground in World War II, sabotaged supplies destined for Japanese occupiers, smuggled food to starving American prisoners and survived torture after she was captured. \u2022 Finally, it\u2019s hard to imagine Southeast Asia without the sizzle of street food. But separate campaigns in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam are squeezing out vendors in the name of public order and food safety. Today, the presidency of the U.N. Security Council changes hands. That\u2019s because the five permanent members and the 10 nonpermanent members each hold the role for one month, following English alphabetical order. Sweden was up when the year started. Ukraine took February and the United Kingdom March. The United States held April and hands off to Uruguay. Next month, the order starts back at the top: Bolivia, then China, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Italy and Japan. This is just the second time that Uruguay, a U.N. founding member, has held a Security Council seat. The first, in 1965-66, came after a reorganization to increase nonpermanent representation. Uruguay helped Singapore and a handful of other nations create the Forum of Small States, meant to allow tinier U.N. members to amplify their messages. For May, Uruguay\u2019s ambassador, Elbio Oscar Roselli, above, organizes and speaks at meetings and sets schedules. You could say that he is well named for the role of international diplomacy. \u201cOscar\u201d spread across Europe and beyond thanks to the popularity of the epic poetry published by the mid-18th century Scottish poet James MacPherson. The name has two possible roots: from Gaelic, meaning \u201cfriend of deer,\u201d or from Old English, meaning \u201csword of God.\u201d Lauren Hard contributed reporting. _____ This briefing was prepared for the Australian morning.
