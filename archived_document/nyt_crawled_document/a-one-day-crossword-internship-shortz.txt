{"text": "SPECIAL POST \u2014 In March, a teacher at SAR High School in the Bronx wrote to me about a student, Chloe Rosenfeld. Seniors there are required to spend time pursuing a special area of interest, and Chloe had chosen puzzles. The teacher wondered if Chloe could meet with me and Joel and see how The New York Times Crossword is put together. I said yes. We agreed to meet on April 25. Since Joel and I work largely at my home in Pleasantville, N.Y., Chloe came there. Below is the report on her experience that she wrote for school.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/crosswords/a-one-day-crossword-internship-shortz.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Crosswords & Games", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T12:00:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T12:00:06-04:00", "abstract": "Chloe Rosenfeld, a high school senior from the Bronx, N.Y., reports on her day learning the ropes from Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano.", "title": "A One-Day Crossword Internship"}
