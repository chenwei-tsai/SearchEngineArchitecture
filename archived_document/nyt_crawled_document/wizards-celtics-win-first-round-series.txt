{"text": "John Wall scored 42 points, Bradley Beal added 31, and the Washington Wizards withstood a furious comeback to close out the Hawks with a 115-99 victory Friday night in Atlanta, winning the opening-round playoff series, 4-2. The Hawks fell behind by 22 early in the third quarter before making a game of it down the stretch. But they never led, and Wall stymied the rally with huge plays at both ends of the court. Wall\u2019s block of Dennis Schroder\u2019s layup kept the Hawks from closing the gap to a single point, and Wall hit every big shot in the closing minutes. He scored 19 points in the fourth quarter, ensuring that Washington picked up the first road victory by either team in the series. The Wizards advanced to face top-seeded Boston in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Celtics closed out the Bulls, 4-2, with a 105-83 victory in Chicago. Paul Millsap led the Hawks with 31 points, and Schroder had 26. After losing three close games in Washington, the Hawks seemed to run out of steam in the return to Philips Arena, ending a disappointing season. CELTICS 105, BULLS 83 Avery Bradley scored 23 points, and the hot-shooting Boston Celtics pounded host Chicago to win their first-round series, 4-2. The top-seeded Celtics torched Chicago to finish off a tougher-than-anticipated series and advance in the playoffs for the first time since 2012. Boston regrouped after dropping the first two games at home. Bradley finished one point shy of a playoff career high he set in Game 5. He nailed three 3-pointers and the Celtics hit 16 of 39 from long range. Gerald Green scored 16 and Isaiah Thomas had 12 before heading home to Washington state for his sister Chyna\u2019s funeral on Saturday. Her death in a car accident the day before the playoff opener dealt a blow to the Celtics. But Boston rallied around Thomas and regrouped when it looked like the series might slip from reach. Jimmy Butler led Chicago with 23 points. But the Bulls never really found their rhythm over the final four games with point guard Rajon Rondo sidelined by a broken right thumb. Dwyane Wade shot just 1 of 10 in a two-point effort that could be his final appearance for the Bulls. He has a $23.8 million option on the two-year deal he signed last summer to leave Miami and come home to Chicago. BIRD QUITS THE PACERS AGAIN Larry Bird stepped down as president of basketball operations for the Indiana Pacers, another of the stunningly abrupt decisions that have become a hallmark of his post-playing career. General Manager Kevin Pritchard will be elevated to take his place, according to multiple news reports. The move was first reported by Yahoo Sports. Bird leaves the Pacers ahead of a pivotal summer in which the franchise will have to decide what to do with Paul George, the star forward who can become a free agent after next season. There is wide speculation that he would prefer to play for the Los Angeles Lakers. With that potentially franchise-changing development pending, Bird is stepping down from a major role with the Pacers for a third time. Bird coached the Pacers from 1997 to 2000, leading them to the finals in 2000 before walking away from the job, applying a long-held theory that a coach\u2019s effectiveness is diminished after three or four years on the job. He returned as team president in 2003, helping construct a club that was among the best in the league. The Pacers won 61 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals in 2003-4. That team fell apart the next season after the \u201cMalice at the Palace,\u201d the ugly scene in Auburn Hills, Mich., in which the Indiana players Ron Artest, Stephen Jackson and Jermaine O\u2019Neal fought with Detroit Pistons fans. Bird methodically reshaped the team into a contender again, building a promising core around George and Danny Granger and helping mold the troublemaker Lance Stephenson into a force. Bird was named N.B.A. executive of the year in 2012, then stepped down a few months later. At the time, he hinted that health had played a role in his decision, and he stayed away for a year before returning as the Pacers\u2019 top executive. With Frank Vogel as coach, the Pacers reached the conference finals in 2013 and 2014 with a new core of George, Stephenson and Roy Hibbert. Bird did not renew Vogel\u2019s contract after last season and installed Nate McMillan as the coach. The Pacers were swept out of the first round this season by the Cleveland Cavaliers, a major point of frustration for George, one of the league\u2019s most versatile stars.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/sports/basketball/wizards-celtics-win-first-round-series.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T00:22:53-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T00:22:53-04:00", "abstract": "John Wall led Washington with 42 points; Avery Bradley scored 23 to lead Boston; and Larry Bird stepped down from the Pacers\u2019 front office.", "title": "Wizards and Celtics Both Clinch Series and Will Meet in the Next Round"}
