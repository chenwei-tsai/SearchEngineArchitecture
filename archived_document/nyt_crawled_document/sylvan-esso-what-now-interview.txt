For her, the museum had been a frequent destination when she was an indie-rocker based in Brooklyn; it was the first visit for her partner in Sylvan Esso, Nick Sanborn, who concocts the tracks behind her voice. They live now in Durham, N.C. \u201cWhat Now\u201d is the second Sylvan Esso album, the sequel and reaction to the duo\u2019s self-titled 2014 debut album and its spiraling popularity; it included \u201cCoffee,\u201d which has been streamed more than 47 million times on Spotify alone. When the album appeared, Sylvan Esso started out touring clubs in a Prius, with Mr. Sanborn running lights as well as music from his computer. A year later, they were performing at big festivals and headlining theaters. But as the title suggests, \u201cWhat Now\u201d is not exactly a victory lap. Ms. Meath and Mr. Sanborn started writing new songs \u201ceven before we\u2019d really gotten off the road,\u201d Ms. Meath recalled. \u201cAnd then we had a couple of months frozen in panic and fear.\u201d Despite the debut album\u2019s popularity, they were thinking, Mr. Sanborn said, that \u201cmaybe it was a fluke.\u201d Sylvan Esso grew out of a chance meeting on the indie-rock circuit in 2010. Ms. Meath\u2019s band at the time, the folky three-woman group Mountain Man, shared a bill at a club in Milwaukee with Mr. Sanborn\u2019s solo project, which he once described as \u201cloud, bad instrumental hip-hop.\u201d She asked him to remix a song, and that led, eventually, to them teaming up as Sylvan Esso, a name derived from characters in the video game Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery. On their first album, Ms. Meath said, \u201cYou just hear us being like: \u2018What if we made pop songs? Wouldn\u2019t that be fun? What if people listened to them? Let\u2019s write it like people will listen to them.\u2019 And then it happened.\u201d They found loyal listeners. \u201cRadio\u201d and \u201cDie Young,\u201d songs previewed from the new album, have had millions of streams. \u201cThey seem to be embraced by many different segments of the music-consuming populace for many different reasons, which I think is a lot more representative of how music is actually made in 2017,\u201d said Jenn Wasner, who sings and writes songs for the rock band Wye Oak and the electronics-oriented Flock of Dimes, which will be touring with Sylvan Esso in August. \u201cSometimes people get caught up in these misplaced ideas of what authenticity is,\u201d Ms. Wasner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s great to see that people on a mass scale are starting to understand that sound is sound and musicians are sculptors of sound. We make noises to make people feel things, and the method is irrelevant.\u201d As the conversation began under the whale, a video screen roared loudly to life with a documentary on capturing and cataloging whales. The interview had to adjourn to a quieter alcove. \u201cThere\u2019s too many things coming at us all the time,\u201d Mr. Sanborn said while escaping the video intrusion. \u201cThat could be a beautiful moment, and then somebody decided to put this totally unnecessary thing there that prevents you from being able to feel alive.\u201d The interface between humanity and technology \u2014 sometimes productive, sometimes antagonistic \u2014 matters a lot in Sylvan Esso\u2019s songs, in both sound and lyrics. Ms. Meath\u2019s voice is natural, chipper and conversational, with melodies as direct as pop and folk songs. Much of the music, meanwhile, comes from synthesizers and drum machines. But Sylvan Esso evades the booming, repetitive overkill of typical electronic dance music. Instead, the tracks stay fragile and keep coming deliberately unsprung, defying mechanical regularity. \u201cMy favorite electronic music is music that really sounds like humans made it,\u201d Mr. Sanborn said. \u201cYou want those choices to be emotionally intentional. Hopefully every sound you pick, just the way every word you would pick, is there for a reason.\u201d He added: \u201cI like sounds that are the opposite of presets. I like using things where you really have to get in there, and every sound you make on them, nobody has ever made before.\u201d \u201cRadio\u201d honors the three-and-a-half-minute formula for pop singles even as it\u2019s skeptical about how hits are propagated via electronic media: \u201cDo you got the moves/to make it stick, yeah/to get the clicks,\u201d Ms. Meath sings, over perky electronic loops warped by hands-on, physical manipulation of reel-to-reel tape. \u201cKick Jump Twist\u201d considers the public lives lived on social media: \u201cThey want all invisible eyes on them,\u201d Ms. Meath sings, amid skeletal, unsteady syncopated blips. \u201cIt\u2019s figuring out performing how you want to be as a human,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you did that 20 years ago, if you curated your life so finely like that, you\u2019d be pretty uptight or maybe crazy. Now everyone has a brand and an ability to do that. The problem is that people think people\u2019s brands are real life.\u201d A song that\u2019s closer to club-style propulsion, \u201cJust Dancing,\u201d considers romance in the era of Tinder, Ms. Meath said. \u201cI wrote it with the idea of just how addicting the feeling of a brand-new relationship is,\u201d she explained, \u201cand about how you could, if you wanted to, only go on first dates forever. You would have that feeling of endless possibility, and you could be your most perfect self, the most self-composed version of yourself in someone\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s why the song itself continually starts over again. It\u2019s the most exhausting song on the record.\u201d There\u2019s also a love song on the album, approached from a typically unexpected angle. In \u201cDie Young,\u201d Ms. Meath complains about leaving behind glamorous youthful bravado for a long-term commitment: \u201cI was gonna die young/Now I gotta wait for you honey.\u201d She said, \u201cI try to write songs that people haven\u2019t written before, and somehow someone hadn\u2019t written that song in that way. I\u2019ve been studying the magic of pop songs that twist around one idea, one smart line, and that\u2019s the peak, and then the whole song moves out from that. \u2018Die Young\u2019 was the endgame of that for me. That\u2019s one of the songs I\u2019m proudest of.\u201d But Mr. Sanborn recalled that the song didn\u2019t arrive easily. \u201cThe minute before she wrote the song was the end of a week of her being like: \u2018I just can\u2019t do this any more! I\u2019m done! I can\u2019t write songs any more! It\u2019s over!,\u2019\u201d he said as Ms. Meath nodded and laughed. \u201cAnd then, at the trough of the depression cycle, she\u2019d walk in and say, \u2018Hey, I wrote this thing.\u2019 And it would be like my favorite thing she\u2019d ever written, and it would be totally complete. I just had to try to not screw it up.\u201d", "section": "Arts", "abstract": "This North Carolina-based pop duo overcomes anxiety for its second album, \u201cWhat Now.\u201d", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T15:47:09-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/music/sylvan-esso-what-now-interview.html", "title": "Sylvan Esso Keeps Electronic Pop Human"}
