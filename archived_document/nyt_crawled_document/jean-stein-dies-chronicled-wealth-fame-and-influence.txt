{"text": "Jean Stein, a child of Hollywood wealth whose restless curiosity led her to produce oral histories about Robert F. Kennedy, the tragic Warhol star Edie Sedgwick and a group of people and families who transformed Los Angeles, died on Sunday in Manhattan. She was 83. Her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor and publisher of The Nation, said her mother had died in a fall from her 15th floor apartment at 10 Gracie Square, on the East Side of Manhattan. She had been suffering from depression, Ms. vanden Heuvel said. The police said they were investigating the death as a suicide. Ms. Stein, whose father was a founder of the entertainment giant MCA, found a vivid subject in Ms. Sedgwick, an heiress from a patrician family whose downfall came to define the perils of ephemeral celebrity. A beautiful and charming personality, Ms. Sedgwick turned to injecting LSD and speed and shoplifting sprees before dying of an overdose at 28 in 1971. \u201cI felt that she symbolized the 1960s the way that Zelda Fitzgerald represented the 1920s,\u201d Ms. Stein told the interviewer David Rothenberg on the New York FM radio station WBAI in 1982, when \u201cEdie: An American Biography\u201d was published. \u201cBut what makes \u2018Edie,\u2019 the book, work is that she touched so many worlds \u2014 these different, alienated worlds in the 1960s \u2014 and the story is as much about all of those people as it is about her.\u201d Ms. Stein, who knew Ms. Sedgwick \u2014 and let her stay in her daughter Wendy\u2019s bedroom after a hotel fire \u2014 was aware by 1967 of her dissolution. \u201cShe was the quintessential poor little rich girl,\u201d Ms. Stein told WBAI. \u201cShe\u2019d be wearing fur, but underneath it she was skeletal and wearing leotards and had anorexia.\u201d For her most recent book, \u201cWest of Eden: An American Place\u201d (2016), Ms. Stein spent parts of more than 20 years interviewing people about the influence of Hollywood (through her own family, the Warner brothers and the actress Jennifer Jones), oil exploration (through the Doheny family) and real estate (through the Garlands, especially Jane, a schizophrenic heiress) on Los Angeles. \u201cAll the while, there are the voices you can\u2019t stop listening to,\u201d Maria Russo wrote in The New York Times Book Review. \u201cAs Stein\u2019s people rummage through their faulty memories, they talk the way human beings actually talk \u2014 heavy on score-settling, gossip and hearsay. It\u2019s at times almost unbelievable what they are willing to say.\u201d Jean Babette Stein was born in Chicago on Feb. 9, 1934, the daughter of Jules Stein, who was an ophthalmologist before starting what became MCA, and the former Doris Jones. At the family estate in Beverly Hills, Misty Mountain, Ms. Stein would hear coyotes howling at night, she said in \u201cWest of Eden.\u201d During World War II, her father built a secret room \u2014 a sort of bunker \u2014 behind the bar in case the Nazis attacked. At a home where Hollywood stars were frequent guests, she and her sister, Susan, were \u201cbrought down to curtsy like little dolls in our dressing gowns,\u201d Ms. Stein said. When she was 16, her father\u2019s lawyer tried to set her up on a date with a young lawyer, Roy Cohn, who was part of the team prosecuting an economist, William Remington, for espionage and who would go on to notoriety as counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy. Ms. Stein went to watch Mr. Cohn in court, she said, \u201cand within minutes my sympathies were with the victim.\u201d They never went out. She attended Wellesley College and the Sorbonne but did not graduate. Gore Vidal, a close friend who was interviewed in \u201cWest of Eden,\u201d said that she had been \u201csomewhat unfocused, not terribly interested in the academic world\u201d of Wellesley, and he took her to literary events where she would meet interesting people. \u201cI didn\u2019t see her for six months,\u201d he said, \u201cand the next time I did, she was with Faulkner.\u201d Indeed, in 1955, while she was in France, Ms. Stein interviewed William Faulkner for The Paris Review. When she asked if there was a formula to be a successful novelist, Faulkner told her it was 99 percent talent, 99 percent discipline and 99 percent work. \u201cAn artist,\u201d he said in the lengthy interview, \u201cis a creature driven by demons. He don\u2019t know why they choose him, and he\u2019s usually too busy to wonder why. He is completely amoral in that he will rob, borrow, beg or steal from anybody and everybody to get the work done.\u201d Stein: \u201cDo you mean the writer should be completely ruthless?\u201d Faulkner: \u201cThe writer\u2019s only responsibility is to his art. He will be completely ruthless if he is a good one.\u201d Ms. Stein worked for several years at The Paris Review for its editor, George Plimpton, before moving to New York City to be an assistant to Clay Felker, then the features editor of Esquire magazine. Later, her marriage to William vanden Heuvel, a lawyer who had been a special assistant to Robert Kennedy when he was the United States attorney general, helped give her entree to the train that bore Kennedy\u2019s body from New York to Washington after his assassination in 1968. The journey inspired the structure of her book, \u201cAmerican Journey: The Times of Robert Kennedy\u201d (1970), an oral history edited by Mr. Plimpton. In Life magazine, Ben Bradlee, the executive editor of The Washington Post, described Ms. Stein as a \u201cbrilliant, non-obtrusive interviewer,\u201d writing that there was \u201cnew vital history in these pages, more than any review can hold.\u201d A review in The New Yorker said the book \u201cmortalizes\u201d Kennedy \u201cby bringing his complex and contradictory character most vividly to life.\u201d Shy and with a fluttery voice, Ms. Stein turned her former apartment on Central Park West into a salon for writers, artists, politicians and academics. \u201cShe loved to gather people of all kinds,\u201d Katrina vanden Heuvel said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cShe always had the most interesting writers mixed up with troublemakers. She had Daniel Ellsberg with Adlai Stevenson, or an ex-general with war protesters. Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer had a fistfight there.\u201d Ms. Stein sought a similarly eclectic mix when she was the editor and publisher of Grand Street, a quarterly literary journal, from around 1990 to 2004. \u201cI am very interested in these different worlds coming together, so you\u2019re not only writing, you\u2019re not only art, you\u2019re not only science, you\u2019re bringing them all together,\u201d she told The Los Angeles Times in 1990. \u201cAnd, in a way, I\u2019ve lived my life in New York that way.\u201d In addition to her daughters, Katrina and Wendy vanden Heuvel, Ms. Stein is survived by two granddaughters. Her marriages \u2014 to Mr. vanden Heuvel, a former American diplomat, and Torsten Wiesel, a Swedish neurobiologist who was a co-recipient of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \u2014 ended in divorce. Ms. Stein explained her embrace of the oral history form when she discussed \u201cEdie,\u201d which Mr. Plimpton also edited. \u201cEach person is speaking directly to you,\u201d she told WBAI. \u201cIt\u2019s like you have 25 people in the room talking to you, just as if you were in a conversation. Nobody is ever telling you, the reader, what you should think.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/books/jean-stein-dies-chronicled-wealth-fame-and-influence.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T21:05:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "created_date": "2017-05-02T21:05:37-04:00", "abstract": "Ms. Stein used oral histories to sketch vivid accounts of Edie Sedgwick, Robert Kennedy and powerful families of Los Angeles.", "title": "Jean Stein, Who Chronicled Wealth, Fame and Influence, Dies at 83"}
