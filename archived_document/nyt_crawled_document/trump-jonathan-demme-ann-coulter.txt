Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here\u2019s the latest. 1. The Trump administration shook up the nation\u2019s economic base in two ways. First, he proposed cutting taxes for businesses and most Americans, which Republicans saluted but one Democratic congressman called \u201cmathematically impossible.\u201d (We\u2019re parsing the details, but our Washington editors see it as an opening bid, not a final plan.) Second, a senior official said that Mr. Trump was likely to sign an executive order taking the first steps to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. _____  2. Other developments on another busy day in Washington: The full Senate was briefed on North Korea at the White House. The House Freedom Caucus gave a thumbs-up to a draft of a new health care bill. The FCC chairman outlined sweeping changes on net neutrality. The Department of Homeland Security opened an office to help victims of crime by undocumented immigrants. Above, victims\u2019 relatives at the announcement. The flurry of activity comes ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s 100th day in office. We circled back to voters we spoke to after his election, and found that many of his biggest backers like what they see so far. _____ 3. And now, away from Washington: President Trump will return to New York a week from Thursday, his first visit since the inauguration. City officials are preparing for protests. Former President Barack Obama will be paid $400,00 for a speech at a Wall Street conference on health care later this year. Our investigative reporter uncovered the identity of one of Jared Kushner\u2019s most important business partners. He\u2019s a member of Israel\u2019s Steinmetz family, diamond traders whose most prominent figure is under investigation in the U.S. for possible bribe payments in Guinea. And Ivanka Trump, interviewed by NBC in Germany, said that allowing Syrian refugees into the U.S. \u201chas to be part of the discussion.\u201d Above, Ms. Trump at the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. _____ 4. More tumult in the world of media: 11 current and former employees, above, have filed a class-action lawsuit against Fox News alleging racial discrimination. And ESPN, which is struggling as more consumers cut the cable cord, laid off some well-known on-air personalities. _____ 5. Our military correspondent is on the front lines in Iraq, where the fight to retake western Mosul from the Islamic State continues. He guides us through a city where the plight of thousands of civilians appears to be worsening by the day. _____ 6. The conservative commentator Ann Coulter canceled her speech at the University of California, Berkeley, after she lost the backing of student groups. She called it \u201ca sad day for free speech.\u201d Ms. Coulter had originally been invited to speak on Thursday, but the university pulled out because of security threats. Activists from the far-right and far-left have been clashing in Berkeley, a strange turn for an area known as the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement. _____ 7. Turkey detained more than a thousand police officers, accusing them of being \u201csecret imams\u201d for Fethullah Gulen, a cleric living in exile in the U.S. The authorities blame him for the failed coup in July, since which about 45,000 people have been arrested. Turkey\u2019s demand for Mr. Gulen to be extradited is almost certain to be discussed at a coming meeting in Washington between President Trump and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. _____ 8. You can\u2019t make this stuff up. United Airlines is under fire because \u2026 an enormous rabbit died on a flight from Britain. Simon, a three-foot-long Continental giant, was \u201cfit as a fiddle\u201d before he was put into the cargo hold of a flight from Heathrow bound for, yes, O\u2019Hare, in Chicago. Only 10 months old, he had been expected to grow into the world\u2019s biggest rabbit, surpassing his father, Darius, pictured above, who grew to be 4 feet 4 inches. _____ 9. In memoriam: Jonathan Demme, the Oscar-winning director of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d and \u201cPhiladelphia,\u201d died at the age of 73, two years after disclosing that he had cancer. As far back as 1986, he caught the eye of the New Yorker movie critic Pauline Kael. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other director who is so instinctively and democratically interested in everybody he shows you,\u201d she wrote. Above, Mr. Demme on the set of \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate\u201d in 2004. _____ 10. Finally, planning to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art on your next trip to New York? Pad your wallet. The Met is in quiet talks with New York City over whether to charge out-of-town visitors admission. Many people don\u2019t pay the suggested $25 fee; a mandatory one could generate badly needed revenue. But some see it as a risky move. Have a great night. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.
