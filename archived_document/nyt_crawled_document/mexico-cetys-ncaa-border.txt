{"text": "TIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 The day began before 7 a.m. at the Baja Inn, where several members of the Cetys University women\u2019s volleyball team had spent the night in preparation for a two-day trip to the United States. In sweatpants and warm-up gear, the players made a determined effort to get downstairs and out the door before other guests were even awake. These players live in Mexicali, home to a Cetys campus, a little more than two hours east of Tijuana. The rest of the team, from the university\u2019s Tijuana campus, soon joined them, and shortly after 7 their van rolled into the city\u2019s warren of streets. That day\u2019s match, an exhibition against San Diego Christian College, was not scheduled to begin until 1 p.m., and the gym was less than 40 miles away. But crossing the United States-Mexico border can take hours, so the team played it safe, sacrificing sleep to make sure it arrived on time. \u201cWe never know how long it\u2019s going to be,\u201d Margarita Cuellar, the team\u2019s coach, said through an interpreter. There are plenty of Mexican colleges that field volleyball teams, of course. But teams representing Cetys (pronounced SET-ease) frequently make international excursions like this as part of an ambitious bid to become the first Mexican member of the N.C.A.A. For the athletes and their coaches, the move would offer a welcome chance to compete against tougher opponents. \u201cYou really can\u2019t compare the level of basketball, U.S. versus Mexico,\u201d said David Ackerman, a Mexican student whose two younger brothers commute daily from Tijuana to a Catholic high school in San Diego, in part for the basketball opportunities. Cetys administrators see their own opportunity. Sounding a bit like a major-conference athletic director, Fernando Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda, president of Cetys, said, \u201cWe are conscious that sports along with research and visible alumni are a way to raise exposure.\u201d Cetys fields varsity-level teams in four sports for men and three for women but plans to expand to at least five for each. The university was founded, Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda said, \u201cto develop the well-rounded individual for regional development \u2014 more on the Mexican side, but it has evolved to address needs on both sides of the border.\u201d For many residents, Tijuana already functions as a suburb of San Diego. Many people commute from side to side daily, waking up early to beat the worst of the crowds. \u201cThe trips aren\u2019t that far,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor Vild\u00f3sola, the Cetys men\u2019s basketball coach. \u201cA lot closer than anywhere we play in Mexico.\u201d But the border makes everything more complicated. On an ordinary weekday at rush hour, the line of vehicles at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry can extend for miles, as every passenger in every car waits to have his or her papers checked by United States Customs and Border Protection. Many who cross regularly said there had been no noticeable difference since the ascendance of President Trump, who kicked off his campaign by saying that criminals were entering the United States from Mexico. But the new administration has nonetheless put those who move frequently between the countries on edge. On the volleyball team\u2019s recent trip, the van slowed down just before 7:30 a.m. and took its place in a mile-long line at the checkpoint. As it inched forward, the players blasted pop songs, and the smell of newly applied nail polish filled the van. It took 90 minutes to reach the front of the line. \u201cNo hablen nada,\u201d the Cetys players were told as they approached the checkpoint. Don\u2019t say anything. And don\u2019t make any jokes. A border officer slid open the door and checked every traveler\u2019s documentation, calling out their names one at a time. The players later commented on what they said was the agent\u2019s friendliness and excellent Spanish \u2014 \u201cgood pronunciation\u201d \u2014 and soon the van sped north. Blessed with a couple of extra hours, the team, known as the Zorros, stopped at an IHOP for a leisurely breakfast. Last week, the N.C.A.A. made permanent a pilot program allowing each division to invite Canadian or Mexican institutions. Simon Fraser University in British Columbia was the N.C.A.A.\u2019s first international member, gaining entry to Division II and the Great Northwest Athletic Conference in 2012. But it remains unknown whether the N.C.A.A. will open its door on the Mexican border. If Cetys were not the Centro de Ense\u00f1anza T\u00e9cnica y Superior, based primarily in Tijuana and Mexicali, but rather, say, the Center for Technical and Higher Education, based in La Mesa, Calif., just 25 miles north, its case for N.C.A.A. membership would probably be a slam-dunk. A private university focused on engineering with an undergraduate enrollment of a little more than 3,000, Cetys is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, just as Stanford and U.C.L.A. are. It doles out numerous athletic scholarships, both full and partial, and its annual athletic budget of $1.25 million puts it on pace, Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda said, to match comparable Division II institutions in the coming years, especially as it adds teams to fit Division II requirements. The university, which currently competes in a Mexican athletic association known as Conadeip, is in the process of hiring its first full-time athletic director. Cetys\u2019s bid for N.C.A.A. membership got a boost when Leslie Wong, the president of San Francisco State University and a member of the Division II Presidents Council, became an enthusiastic backer. San Francisco State is a member of the Division II California Collegiate Athletic Association along with 11 other institutions in the California State University system and the University of California, San Diego. It is Cetys\u2019s prospective league. Cetys has hired Nancy Mitchell, a former N.C.A.A. staff member who consults with institutions looking to join the organization or move among its divisions. At the last N.C.A.A. convention, in January, Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda made a private presentation to several leagues (N.C.A.A. rules will require more than one conference to sponsor Cetys\u2019s bid) and visited a C.C.A.A. meeting. This past weekend, Cetys sent athletes to a meeting of the conference\u2019s student-athlete advisory committee. But the last time a Mexican university made headway toward N.C.A.A. membership \u2014 a push by the noted football power Monterrey Tech in 2013 \u2014 Division II delegates narrowly declined to open membership to Mexican institutions as they had Canadian ones. The commissioner of the Lone Star Conference, the league Monterrey Tech would have joined, said there were no active efforts to rekindle the bid. Terri Steeb Gronau, the N.C.A.A. vice president for Division II, drew contrasts between Cetys now and the failed effort four years ago. \u201cEven though Monterrey Tech was discussed, that was just a potential option \u2014 it was more conceptual,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere this one is, there\u2019s a specific school, the school fits the mission of other schools within the West Coast.\u201d Gronau noted a dearth of Division II football teams on the West Coast, to the point that adding even just one more program in the area, such as Cetys, could have a significantly salutary impact on other teams\u2019 schedules. The most obvious case could be football, which is the most popular sport at Cetys. Though the C.C.A.A. does not sponsor football, the Great Northwest does, so there is the possibility that Cetys could eventually have multiple conference allegiances (as many N.C.A.A. members do). In September, the Zorros will travel to Humboldt State of the Great Northwest Conference for an exhibition. But significant hurdles to full N.C.A.A. membership remain. Should Cetys gain entry, not only its athletes but also all C.C.A.A. athletes who wished to travel to Cetys for road games would need passports or visas. The impact on foreign nationals holding student visas, which can restrict them from traveling outside the United States, would need to be addressed by the conference. And then there is the most concrete barrier of all \u2014 the border itself, which in addition to guaranteeing annoying delays, is more politicized than ever perhaps. Efforts to overcome these obstacles might be \u201charder right now,\u201d according to Nathan Salant, the C.C.A.A. commissioner, given the political climate. The conference supports Cetys\u2019s efforts, Salant said, and with last week\u2019s N.C.A.A. ruling, a division-wide vote could come as soon as January. If admitted, Cetys could begin the standard three-year provisional membership in fall 2018. However, acknowledging the obstacles that remain, Salant added, \u201cIt\u2019s too early for me to say, \u2018We\u2019ll take them.\u2019\u201d A visit to Cetys\u2019s Tijuana campus indicates just how close, in every sense, the university is to another American institution. By car, and accounting for traffic in Tijuana, the trip to Cetys from downtown San Diego takes less than an hour. (Travelers entering Mexico from the United States frequently receive no inspection.) On the streets of Tijuana, iterations of American chains \u2014 Sears, Walmart, Buffalo Wild Wings \u2014 mingle with local businesses, and on a main avenue, the Paseo de los H\u00e9roes, Abraham Lincoln is honored with a large statue. Mountains in California are visible from Cetys\u2019s hilltop complex. On a recent morning, the baseball team, which had recently returned from a doubleheader at Azusa Pacific, a small Division II Christian college near Los Angeles, ran drills and took batting practice. The players use wooden bats in Mexico, switching to aluminum against N.C.A.A. opponents. \u201cWe are very thankful to be able to go play and have some games,\u201d said center fielder Marcos Almonte, \u201cbecause that motivates us.\u201d Women\u2019s volleyball players said they also felt challenged, in a variety of ways, when playing north of the border. In the United States, according to several players, illegal sets are policed less strictly, griping toward the officials is less tolerated and the ball itself is lighter. \u201cWe hate it,\u201d Yared Carmona said with a frustrated smile. \u201cIt flies away.\u201d Hours after their early morning departure, after the border crossing and breakfast, the day\u2019s volleyball game turned out to be little more than an exhibition match. San Diego Christian competes in the N.A.I.A., a tier below the N.C.A.A. and its three divisions. For its players, the match was a gussied-up practice; the team did not even wear its full uniforms. San Diego Christian may have had the edge in size. But over the course of four games, Cetys displayed superior resourcefulness and skill, with crafty sets and feinted spikes. Cetys won all four games, mounting a substantial comeback to take the final one, 25-23. \u201cThe kind of game they play is really fast,\u201d Maritza Alvarado, a senior, had said of American opponents. She then turned her attention to the three best-of-five competitions against Division II teams that the team would play the next day. These are the kinds of teams Cetys can expect to face if its N.C.A.A. membership comes through. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll be better,\u201d she said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/sports/mexico-cetys-ncaa-border.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T02:00:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T02:00:10-04:00", "abstract": "Cetys University is making an ambitious bid to become the first Mexican member of the N.C.A.A.", "title": "Looking to Cross the Border From Mexico, Into the N.C.A.A."}
