{"text": "Dear Match Book, I\u2019m a queer, mixed-race Latina living in Nashville, Tenn. I\u2019m an introvert who never fits in anywhere I go. I\u2019m an atheist who works at a church and a woman who works in a tech department. I\u2019ve just recently begun dating an awesome woman from New York City. She loves to read George Saunders and Octavia E. Butler and watch \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (she\u2019s also read the books by George R. R. Martin). Can you help me think of a book I could recommend for her that would knock her adorable socks off? LAURIE STEVENSNASHVILLE, TENN. Dear Laurie, Your letter sparked a burst of gleeful nostalgia between an old friend and me: People are still wooing each other with books! Mixtapes may be virtually obsolete, my friend noted, but seduction through books \u2014 another courting method left over from the analog age \u2014 lives on. It was during the heyday of mixtapes that I first read \u201cGeek Love\u201d (1989) by Katherine Dunn. Before I picked up Dunn\u2019s novel about the Binewskis, a family of self-styled carnival freaks, I had been semi-estranged from fantastical fiction since childhood. But Dunn\u2019s daring spectacular \u2014 told in a torrent of sharp, detailed language \u2014 about family and love and belonging pulled me back into the realm of fantasy. Plenty of contemporary fiction flirts with fantasy \u2014 a superpower here, a portal there \u2014 but Nnedi Okorafor\u2019s 2010 novel \u201cWho Fears Death\u201d is an ambitious, sprawling true science fiction novel that grapples with race and gender. Set in a post-apocalyptic African world, the book tells the story of a shape-shifting sorceress named Onyesonwu with a heroic, tragic destiny. Her fully imagined emotional and physical life connects with vivid sensory details (this book describes such intense smells!) and an emphasis on the power of stories to create a world that feels very real, despite the novel\u2019s wild, speculative elements. The connections made in \u201cThe Passion,\u201d Jeanette Winterson\u2019s historical fairy tale published in 1987, are erotic and semi-supernatural. Set in Europe (mainly Venice) during the Napoleonic Wars, the book alternates between the narration of Henri, who wants to be a drummer in Napoleon\u2019s army, but ends up a cook, and Villanelle, the cross-dressing daughter of a Venetian boatman, born with webbed feet during a solar eclipse. Their narratives eventually weave together, passing in and out of magic and revealing how both characters are driven by lust and undone by love. Intertwining narratives also underpin Samantha Hunt\u2019s 2016 novel \u201cMr. Splitfoot.\u201d And spooky elements \u2014 including spiritualism \u2014 imbue the story about two women, Ruth and Cora, whose lives and missions overlap. But what sets this moving and mysterious novel apart is Hunt\u2019s understanding of children and outcasts and those unfortunate characters who are both. The children in \u201cMr. Splitfoot\u201d \u2014 Ruth and her tormentor/savior, Nat \u2014 meet in a group home where, \u201cnew arrivals carve filthy words into their dry skin, aching for their absent mothers.\u201d Mothers, even absent ones, are the glue that fuses the two narratives into one journey. Contrary to the dictates of their nature, vampires have thrived during their recent time in the sun. Their proliferation throughout popular culture takes nothing away from the magic of Karen Russell\u2019s short story collection \u201cVampires in the Lemon Grove.\u201d Not all of her stories feature the undead, though the weary fanged one in the title story has abundant charm and \u201ca tan that won\u2019t fade until I die (which I never will).\u201d Russell\u2019s command of the conventions of supernatural storytelling \u2014 which allows her to tweak the immortal and other supernatural forces \u2014 makes all her stories funny, poignant and profound. In Kelly Link\u2019s short fiction anything is possible. A raucous birthday party on a spaceship, a child born without a shadow, and in \u201cOrigin Story\u201d \u2014 my favorite story in her collection \u201cGet in Trouble\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s even a defunct George Saunders-esque theme park based on \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and a reference to \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer.\u201d In each of her fantastical tales, Link creates a new universe from scratch, complete with different laws of physics. From story to story, the styles and environments vary so widely that it takes me a page or two to adjust to each new atmosphere. The supernatural results are disorienting and dazzling, but Link\u2019s characters are so familiar and human \u2014 even when they are not \u2014 that it\u2019s easy to fall in love.
