For example, in one episode, a character is trapped under glass while the song \u201cHelp!\u201d plays. The other shows are to involve even deeper kinds of musical integration. \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d planned as an hourlong drama, will include characters and settings drawn from the lyrics of Mr. Dylan\u2019s songs, and each episode of the Motown show \u2014 whose theme song is the Jackson 5\u2019s \u201cABC\u201d \u2014 will revolve around a different song from that catalog. \u201cTime Out of Mind\u201d and the as-yet-untitled Motown show have not been formally announced, but entertainment executives involved in their production, who were not authorized to discuss contractual details publicly, said that in both cases deals were close to being completed. Representatives of Amazon and Netflix declined to comment on those productions. The news of \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d which is being developed with Lionsgate Entertainment, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. When producers approach music publishers or record labels for licensing rights, they usually seek permission for only a handful of songs. But the deals around these shows break new ground, music executives say, by securing rights to a large pool of songs that the producers can draw on. For \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d that means the catalog of more than 250 songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and for \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d it involves Mr. Dylan\u2019s full catalog of more than 600 songs, including not only the right to record the material with new singers but \u2014 in an arrangement that people close to Mr. Dylan called unprecedented \u2014 to make use of song lyrics for characters, situations and themes in each episode\u2019s plot. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual, and you could only do it with a catalog that has a distinct feel and a distinct meaning,\u201d said Martin Bandier, the chief executive of Sony/ATV, the giant music publisher that controls the Beatles and Motown catalogs. The central force behind each of the new shows is Josh Wakely, a 34-year-old Australian writer and director who has secured extensive licensing arrangements with the songs\u2019 music publishers. Mr. Wakely, whose production company is called Grace: A Storytelling Company, approached Sony/ATV through its Australian office for \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d and has said that it took him three years to complete the licensing deal. He was then introduced to representatives of Mr. Dylan, who controls his own songwriting rights but uses Sony/ATV as an affiliate in Australia. The deals reflect the ever-growing willingness of music publishers \u2014 who control songwriting rights, as opposed to recordings \u2014 to find new sources of income as music sales dry up, as well as the expanding popularity of streaming television. After the success of Netflix in recent years, Amazon Studios has made an aggressive push into television. In addition to shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d each of which has won a Golden Globe for best comedy, the streaming service will also release a highly anticipated Woody Allen comedy later this year. The streaming services\u2019 big push into TV \u2014 along with more cable channels producing original content \u2014 has sent industry executives into a frenzied competition to gobble up talent, and take bigger risks on new projects. Last year, there were 412 scripted television shows, the most ever.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T05:00:12-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/business/media/bob-dylan-inspired-drama-is-in-the-works.html", "item_type": "Article"}
