So why did he disappear? ON A RECENT WINTER morning in Ithaca, N.Y., the artist Banks Violette is fishing for salmon with a group of locals, men who work blue-collar jobs. They don\u2019t know exactly what the heavily tattooed Violette does for a living, just that he grew up in the area. He\u2019s told them he\u2019s a \u201cfabricator.\u201d The truth is more complicated. Just a decade ago, Violette was a celebrated artist showing at top museums around the world; he had his first solo show, at the age of 27, at Team Gallery in 2000. But he has spent the last five years living out of a nondescript clapboard house in this secluded college town in a kind of self-imposed exile from his former life and career, one that had set him on a path toward anguish and addiction. \u201cI live in the middle of nowhere for a very specific reason,\u201d Violette says. He refers to his move to Ithaca as \u201cpulling a J.D. Salinger.\u201d His disappearance has been the source of much speculation, but Violette is planning a return to the art world with his first fully realized exhibition of new work since 2012, tentatively scheduled for later this year at Gladstone Gallery in New York. His reputation and legacy could very well hinge on the show, but it remains an open question if he\u2019s fully immune to the virulent effects of fame that, last time around, almost killed him. VIOLETTE GREW UP ABOUT TWO MILES down the road from where he lives now. His family moved to Ithaca around 1960 because his father wanted to study with Vladimir Nabokov at Cornell, but by the time they got there, the author had left the university. So Violette\u2019s father ended up racing motorcycles instead. Violette became a teenage punk rocker, drug addict and high school dropout. At 19 he left Ithaca for Hawaii, got clean, and a few years later, landed in the M.F.A. program at Columbia University, finishing the degree in 1999. His career began in earnest upon graduation. Jos\u00e9 Freire, a onetime music tour manager who had recently opened Team Gallery in Chelsea, saw Violette\u2019s M.F.A. show and wrote the artist a note in the exhibition\u2019s signature book: \u201cLook, I love your work. Please call me.\u201d Violette\u2019s debut at Team opened in the winter of 2000. His work somehow blended the austerity of minimalism with the anarchic violence of a Slayer album cover. That first show included a plaster-and-aluminum sculpture dangling a death\u2019s-head heavy metal necklace from the twin-lightning-bolt insignia of the SS, and installations inspired by a 1987 suicide epidemic among teenage heavy metal fans in Bergenfield, N.J. Violette fostered a gloomy persona and encouraged dark interpretations of his work. For a 2005 solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art, he built the skeletal remains of a burned church, based on a tradition of ransacked sacred spaces \u2014 including ones in Norway that had been burned and destroyed by members of the country\u2019s black metal scene. Violette felt a strange kinship with these subjects. \u201cIf you can find this compelling as an aesthetic experience,\u201d he says now, \u201cthat\u2019s one step down a queasy slope to putting yourself right next to the person who\u2019s lighting the match. You realize, I am clearly capable of doing exactly the same thing in the right set of circumstances.\u201d Some fans approached Violette on Myspace, eager to discuss \u201cthe joys of murder.\u201d Over a handful of shows, Violette developed a following among curators and collectors \u2014 making him an accidental figurehead for the growing commercialism of the art world \u2014 as well as for metalheads and disaffected hangers-on. His work began to exert a cultish influence on other artists. New York magazine noted at the time that the gallery district in Chelsea \u201clooked like a teenager going through its goth phase.\u201d VIOLETTE HAS SO MANY tattoos and markings on his body \u2014 creeping up his neck and down to his fingertips \u2014 that he compares himself to a \u201cbathroom wall.\u201d The tattoos are like relics from a time, not so long ago, when Violette personally embodied the heavy metal style of his work, with all its intensity and excess. Still, a sense of weary maturity is unmistakable in the artist, the philosophical mien of a survivor. In his career\u2019s first incarnation, Violette treated every show like it could be his last. As his reputation grew in the mid-2000s, he used to blow off steam with a provisional crew of kindred artists that included Dash Snow, Ryan McGinley and Dan Colen \u2014 all young men getting famous off confrontational art. After years of avoiding drugs, Violette began dabbling once again, using heroin as a coping mechanism and as a means of fueling his production. \u201cA lot of it was just being young, being in New York, suddenly having a bunch of attention, suddenly having packed openings, not being able to sleep and working 24 hours a day,\u201d Violette says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really even fun. It was more, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re super freaked out, let\u2019s get high.\u2019\u2009\u201d Others saw the behavior of these artists as a kind of glamour. \u201cNo,\u201d Violette says. \u201cEverybody was terrified. Everybody was sick. Nobody chimed in and said, \u2018Hey, maybe handing somebody a check for $250,000 is probably not the best idea, because clearly they\u2019re not handling the situation very well.\u2019\u2009\u201d Violette was producing work at an alarmingly fast rate, and he depended on heroin \u2014 which he says had an amphetamine-like effect on him \u2014 to help him meet deadlines. When he had a show out of town, he\u2019d smuggle the drug in art crates. His behavior became increasingly erratic. One morning, he arrived at his studio and announced plans to construct a ring of built-in cabinets around one room; at the end of the day, his assistants were stunned to find that Violette, in a narcotized frenzy, had already finished installing the cabinets himself. On another occasion, he was rushed to the hospital. \u201cI had fallen out of a window trying to rescue a dog that did not need to be rescued,\u201d he says. Steel pins were screwed into his hip, and a prescription for pain medication amplified his addiction. By 2012, Violette had scared away or fired all of his staff, and the studio had fallen into disrepair. One of his former assistants committed suicide. Outside the studio, a Dodge Challenger Violette had bought and treasured sat on cinder blocks, its wheels stolen and its windows progressively smashed. His cohort, or what was left of it (Snow was found dead of a heroin overdose in the bathtub of an East Village hotel room in 2009), saw it as emblematic of the artist\u2019s dissolution. Violette decided to \u201chit the eject button,\u201d he says, \u201cto tear it all down and build it back up.\u201d HIS HOUSE IS ALMOST aggressively unassuming. The inside is littered with fishing equipment, and black-and-white works by the likes of Bruce Connor and Bjarne Melgaard hang on the walls, remnants of a former life. It was here that Violette weaned himself off heroin, transitioning to Suboxone, a treatment that is itself addicting, to manage the withdrawal symptoms. \u201cYou\u2019ve now tricked your body into believing that ingesting this chemical is on par with oxygen, or sleep, or food,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWith withdrawal, your body is screaming the same way that your lungs scream for oxygen if you are drowning. It\u2019s a hard thing to be suffocating and keep holding your breath.\u201d When he moved, he simply packed up and left his studio without a word; only a few people knew where he was. The market for his work took a nosedive. Freire of Team recalls a collector confronting him at the gallery, asking why he had sold him all this \u201cworthless\u201d stuff. These days, as he makes new work, circumstances have forced the artist to change his methods. He used to exert himself tirelessly, sometimes for days on end; now he has a bad back, which, for obvious reasons, he is hesitant to ease with medication. Violette is cautious about his return to New York and the art world, but he believes the intervening years of contemplation and sobriety have provided enough distance from temptation. To be safe, he plans to keep Ithaca as his base. In the mornings he enjoys yelling at the deer that run across his property. His past, however, still tugs at him. \u201cTo this day I\u2019ll still get text messages from drug dealers,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to these people for five years and I\u2019ll get updates, like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m in your neighborhood!\u2019\u2009\u201d If you ask Freire, Violette has already \u201cmade a mark on the art world that you could not erase if he never made another piece of art.\u201d But the artist is convinced he has more to contribute. \u201cI believe that art is a kind of conversation, and that there are certain people who have loud voices in that conversation,\u201d he says. Violette wants to be one of those. Taking a drag from a cigarette, his last remaining vice, he adds, \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I ultimately care about.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T10:19:29-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/t-magazine/banks-violette-artist-return.html", "item_type": "Article"}
