{"text": "Brooklyn\u2019s time may have come. But what of the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s? With art enthusiasts and donors increasingly enamored by contemporary art, and the borough now officially hot, the Brooklyn Museum is struggling to preserve and promote its identity as a serious encyclopedic institution that spans thousands of years. As leaders there are finding, it isn\u2019t easy to attract paying customers with historic collections. While many museums with comprehensive collections face similar challenges in keeping up with trends, the Brooklyn Museum is also facing serious financial pressures. To deal with a budget deficit of about $3 million, the museum has undergone two rounds of buyouts and halted acquisitions. The museum\u2019s board seems to have bet on a contemporary emphasis by choosing a new director with a background in that field, Anne Pasternak. Yet she needs to find her own balance between recent art and the museum\u2019s vast holdings in pre-20th-century work. Ms. Pasternak says she favors \u201ccontemporary thinking,\u201d not contemporary exhibitions, but that approach \u2014 along with a notably accelerated effort to rethink the museum\u2019s presentation of its American, Egyptian and European collections \u2014 has inevitably required some internal adjustment. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a turn; it\u2019s not always comfortable,\u201d said Catherine J. Morris, senior curator for the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the museum. It didn\u2019t help that Ms. Pasternak\u2019s star hire, the highly respected contemporary art specialist Nancy Spector, who came from the Guggenheim Museum last spring with great fanfare, decided to return to the Guggenheim less than a year later. Though the Guggenheim, according to many accounts, made Ms. Spector an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse, her departure nevertheless suggested that an encyclopedic museum \u2014 or perhaps one run by Ms. Pasternak \u2014 was not for her. (Ms. Spector declined to comment.) At the same time, as cultural institutions grapple with how to make a case for themselves in an age of increasing internet competition and dwindling philanthropic funding, outside observers say the Brooklyn Museum has no choice but to try to change with the world around it. The city\u2019s other encyclopedic museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to which the Brooklyn Museum is often unflatteringly compared, has been wrestling with the same challenges. Last week, the Met revealed that it was considering charging admission for visitors from outside New York to raise revenue. \u201cLike all encyclopedic museums, the Brooklyn Museum has to divide its attention between balancing its costly obligation to care for, present and pay for artworks and experiences across 5,000 years of history and snagging the attention of price- and time-conscious smartphone users,\u201d said Maxwell L. Anderson, who has served as director of the Dallas Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. \u201cBrooklyn is booming, and the museum is therefore striving to tap into the borough\u2019s energy and support while siphoning audiences from across the East River and around the world.\u201d Even trustees acknowledge the pressure to attract contemporary art audiences and collectors. \u201cIt is hard to compete because contemporary art is a very hot ticket,\u201d said Ms. Sackler, who preceded the board\u2019s current chairwoman, Barbara M. Vogelstein. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a new landscape.\u201d In light of its financial situation, the Brooklyn Museum is regrouping, even as Ms. Pasternak continues to settle in. She faced a steep learning curve when she arrived in 2015, having never run an institution with a $39 million budget \u2014 eight times larger than that of Creative Time, the public nonprofit she ran for 20 years. \u201cAnne certainly came into the museum drinking from the fire hose in terms of getting up to speed on the entirety of the operation of the museum,\u201d said Sharon E. Fay, who last fall became head of the museum\u2019s finance committee and treasurer. \u201cKudos to Anne; her eyes were wide open.\u201d In part, the museum has been scrambling to replace a five-year, $43.8 million fund for programs and other needs, which was underwritten largely by Robert S. Rubin, who remains on the board. \u201cThat fund is now over,\u201d said David Berliner, a real estate executive who last fall stepped into the newly created position of president and chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve expanded the program and driven audiences here but did not execute well enough to have the financials keep up with the program.\u201d Ms. Pasternak, 52, who succeeded the 18-year veteran Arnold L. Lehman, said the museum is heading in a positive direction, though she admitted that the financial hurdles are real. \u201cWe have an opportunity as an institution to think in very current ways,\u201d Ms. Pasternak said. \u201cEverything gets questioned right now. And how exciting is that?\u201d Although the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s suggested adult admission price is $16, half of its 465,000 annual visitors pay nothing, which Ms. Pasternak called \u201ca hardship.\u201d \u201cI hope eventually the city will be open to other ideas \u2014 I think admission policy should be looked at,\u201d she said in an interview that preceded last week\u2019s revelation about the Met. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re free to our community, but we\u2019re not free to people outside of New York City.\u201d Still, Ms. Pasternak points to early signs of progress, like admission revenue, which is up 10 percent over last year; revenue from public programs that has \u201cquadrupled\u201d since she arrived; and school group tours that are up 40 percent over last year, proving, she says, that the institution is \u201cvibing right now.\u201d Mr. Berliner also said that annual attendance is 10 percent higher than it was a decade ago and trending upward. And the museum has added 10 board members, in part bolstering the representation of contemporary art collectors. While Mr. Lehman also focused on contemporary art, Ms. Pasternak has presented some experimental programming more akin to the type she championed at Creative Time, such as having artists interpret the rock star Iggy Pop\u2019s nude body in a life drawing class. Every category of operations is up for reconsideration, from the costly basement printing press for in-house publications (Ms. Pasternak got rid of it) to how long-held artwork should be presented. Ms. Pasternak has already reinstalled the American collection and refreshed the European as well as half of the Egyptian collections, and plans to reopen the Korean gallery, which has been closed for eight years, she says. The museum reinstalled the entire American collection in six months, a rapid overhaul Ms. Pasternak called \u201ctotally taboo in the museum field.\u201d In the process, she added, the museum explored current issues like immigration and Black Lives Matter. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we rotate our collections every two years? We could do it more often if we had more money,\u201d Ms. Pasternak argued. \u201cThere is not one right way to tell history.\u201d In covering the colonial period, for example, the museum now features masters like Gilbert Stuart alongside the self-trained black artist Joshua Johnson. \u201cWe want to make sure that our audiences are seeing themselves as part of the history of this country, too,\u201d Ms. Pasternak said. Some curators in more traditional areas say they do not feel neglected. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at historical material through a contemporary lens in a way that feels urgent,\u201d said Lisa Small, who Ms. Pasternak recently promoted to senior curator of European Art. Admittedly, there is one obstacle the museum will never be able to overcome: being in Brooklyn, where tourists and Manhattan patrons will always be less likely to go. But rather than bemoan its longtime status as stepchild to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Ms. Pasternak said the Brooklyn Museum should celebrate its otherness. \u201cHistorically, people have said, \u2018Poor Brooklyn Museum: we\u2019re not as big as the Met, we\u2019re not quite as encyclopedic as the Met, we don\u2019t have the same number of great masterpieces as the Met, we don\u2019t have the endowment of the Met, we don\u2019t have the board of the Met and \u2014 guess what? \u2014 we\u2019re not even in Manhattan; we\u2019re in Brooklyn,\u2019\u201d Ms. Pasternak said. \u201cAnd I thought to myself, \u2018What if just the opposite were true? What if all these things were really kind of strengths for us?\u2019 And that was a very sort of creative and generative thought exercise for me.\u201d \u201cIf we were in any other city in this country, we would be a huge destination,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the truth is, Brooklyn\u2019s time has come.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/design/brooklyn-museum-contemporary-art.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T17:37:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T17:37:05-04:00", "abstract": "The myriad challenges for Anne Pasternak, director of this institution, include remaining true to Brooklyn\u2019s identity while embracing a shift in trends.", "title": "\u2018Encyclopedic\u2019 Brooklyn Museum Vies for Contemporary Attention"}
