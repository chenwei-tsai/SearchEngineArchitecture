{"text": "There\u2019s a curious musical choice nestled in one of Offred\u2019s pivotal memories that illuminates some of my issues so far with \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Offred attends a march with Moira to protest the country\u2019s devolution into a totalitarian state. Women are being fired from their jobs and their bank accounts frozen, with funds being transferred to their husbands or closest male kin. The people at the march are similar to Offred \u2014 young, urbane, angry at the shape the world is in now that oppression is hurting them directly. Soon the march turns violent as the protesters are shot at. A down-tempo version of \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d by Blondie slinks through this sequence, which culminates with Offred and Moira taking cover in a vacant cafe. A bomb goes off blowing the windows out and glass cascades down. The song fits neither the mood nor the message of the scene and its placement demonstrates for me how \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d can swing wildly from blisteringly powerful to absolutely leaden thanks to decisions that feel artless. Episode 3 looks at what happens when handmaids are suspected of being pregnant. For Offred this means that Rita and Serena Joy show uncharacteristic kindness. She gets more elaborate meals. She\u2019s taken on a trip to visit Janine, who is still in Naomi\u2019s palatial home. At one point a delicate floral arrangement, cut specially for Offred by Serena Joy, is placed in front of her during a meal. \u201cA rose is a rose except here,\u201d Offred says, wary of such a gesture. Offred\u2019s attempt to navigate these changes is juxtaposed with Ofglen\u2019s sentencing for \u201cgender treachery,\u201d a story that, on paper at least, is supposed to be the most harrowing. Ofglen has traded her long red robe for a jumpsuit of the same hue. A cloth muzzle obscures the lower half of her face, making any protests to the guards or the judge that decides her fate impossible. Ofglen is sentenced along with her lover, an unnamed Martha that looks at her with longing and sorrow. They get fleeting minutes together in the back of a van to communicate their love in a tender embrace and tearful glances before the Martha is hanged. Ofglen\u2019s punishment proves to be crueler. She wakes in a sterile, blindingly white room. When she lifts her thin gown she finds her lower half bandaged. It\u2019s only when Aunt Lydia comes in that Ofglen understands the nature of the violation she has undergone. While the word \u201cclitoridectomy\u201d is never spoken, it\u2019s clear this is the mutilation imposed on Ofglen. She has no dialogue. In those final moments, the director, Reed Morano, and the cinematographer, Colin Watkinson, shoot the actor, Alexis Bledel, in extreme close-ups: every line on her face and every shift in her expression on display. Her gaze and the primal scream that ends this scene is the only way to voice the suffering of the character. It\u2019s the kind of performance that demands a lot from an actor. Unfortunately, Ms. Bledel isn\u2019t up to the task. There\u2019s a hollowness to her performance when it needs to be brimming with righteous fury and fear. While her eyebrows twist, contort and furrow, her eyes and body oddly show little depth of emotion. She has always been a performer who has struggled with emotional realism, a fact that becomes undeniable here. But there\u2019s another issue that disrupts what is otherwise an emotional turn. I\u2019ve been waiting to see how the decision to include women of color among the handmaids would affect the story. At this point Gilead is a post-racial society in which fertility supersedes any other issue. This decision doesn\u2019t feel realistic considering the ways in which Christian rightist movements are intertwined with virulent racism. As Soraya Nadia McDonald writes in a discussion of the show on \u201cThe Undefeated\u201d site, \u201cIn a hierarchical society propelled by religious fundamentalism, just about everything in the history of this country suggests that racial divisions would become far more deeply entrenched, not less.\u201d Women of color continue to punctuate the margins of Gilead society. They\u2019re Marthas and handmaids who, beyond Moira, are primarily silent and inconsequential to the plot. In the first two episodes this isn\u2019t much of a problem. But it becomes infuriatingly dishonest on an intellectual, emotional, and historical level when we watch Ofglen\u2019s punishment. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d finds power in remixing history, pulling inspiration from a variety of incidents that highlight the continuous brutality thrust upon women. But it most directly feels like a heightened allegory to the experiences of enslaved black women in America\u2019s history. Like the bodies of the handmaids, those of enslaved black women become a tableau that reflects social ills. They are named only by their oppressors. They are voiceless so that they can be fitting vessels for the physical and emotional labor necessary to keep the cruel systems that oppress them intact. Black women\u2019s stories become useful metaphors for Ofglen and other white handmaids. The interiority of black handmaids remains hopelessly unexplored, but the series has time to course-correct. I admit this may be an instance of my wanting the show to be something it was never aiming for. But if you\u2019re going to trade in allegories of reproductive rights and body horror that throughout this country\u2019s history continue to harm women of color, especially black women, it\u2019s alarming that the actual black women in the narrative aren\u2019t granted any consideration for how they\u2019re wrestling with these very themes. American history is rife with the stories of black women who were sterilized, experimented on and stolen from, their bodily autonomy erased in favor of a \u201cgreater good\u201d they would never share. I think \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is a powerful, engaging show. But its decision to create Gilead as a postracial society and ignore the inner lives of its women of color makes its feminist aims feel halfhearted. If this story didn\u2019t crystallize the depths of Gilead\u2019s barbarity, Offred\u2019s interrogation by Aunt Lydia and a member of the Eye cements it. Offred is defiant, refusing to say anything that could harm Ofglen and quoting scripture in an almost spiteful way. This is met by a cattle prod and it\u2019s only after Serena Joy throws herself onto Offred\u2019s body and says that she\u2019s pregnant that Aunt Lydia stops. When Offred\u2019s period arrives, what little kindness and consideration she\u2019s been shown disappears. \u201cThings can get much worse for you,\u201d Serena Joy coolly says after locking Offred in her room. Both Offred and Ofglen\u2019s plots underline the ways in which female bodies carry currency in this world and how quickly this worth can change. Earlier in the episode, Nick tells Offred, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to be brave. Everybody breaks.\u201d Considering at the fates of Ofglen and Offred, this statement seems less like a warning and more like a promise of what\u2019s to come. Other Gossip: \u2022 When Nick brings ice to Offred\u2019s room in order to tend to her wounds he stands close enough to kiss her. At this point the sexual tension simmering between them is undeniable. \u2022 This episode highlights the growing mental instability and na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Janine. Did her Commander really say he wanted to run away with her and their child, now named Angela by Naomi? Or is this just an elaborate fantasy she\u2019s concocted in order to cope? I\u2019m wondering what Janine\u2019s unreliability means for her pronouncement that Moira was sent off to the colonies in Episode 1. \u2022 Angela\u2019s crying in the background as Offred and Serena Joy prepare to leave Naomi\u2019s is a nice touch. It highlights the tension and competition that looms between them regarding Offred\u2019s fertility.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/television/the-handmaids-tale-episode-3-recap.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T15:22:48-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-05-02T15:22:48-04:00", "abstract": "This is the strongest episode of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d yet but it\u2019s held back from greatness by a near-fatal flaw.", "title": "\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Season 1, Episode 3: Gender Treachery"}
