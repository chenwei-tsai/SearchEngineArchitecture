{"text": "Two days after Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ouster from Fox News over sexual harassment accusations, Alyce Bradley sipped white wine at an outdoor mall in Alpharetta, Ga., and rued the loss of the network\u2019s biggest star. She and her husband have watched Fox News for years \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s always on,\u201d she said \u2014 and they enjoyed what they described as Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u201cbiting commentary\u201d and \u201cdifferent perspective.\u201d \u201cWe will miss him very much,\u201d Ms. Bradley, 61, said. And then, she delivered her verdict. \u201cI think the left is just out to get him \u2014 they won,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s never been convicted, and I feel like he has been shut down.\u201d Her husband was more circumspect. \u201cI like him, but I don\u2019t like what he did, all the sexual harassment,\u201d Bill Bradley, 57, said. \u201cHe could be innocent,\u201d he added, \u201cbut why did he resign or whatever?\u201d In cities across the country \u2014 and even under the same roof \u2014 Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s fans have had mixed reactions to his ouster amid revelations that he and the network had paid five women a total of about $13 million to settle accusations of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior against him. Their views highlighted the inherent tension Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s fate has prompted among his fans as they struggle to square their admiration for him with the troubling nature of the accusations. Like Ms. Bradley, some supporters have remained loyal to Mr. O\u2019Reilly and have dismissed the claims against him, which he has denied. Others, like her husband, were less willing to give Mr. O\u2019Reilly the benefit of the doubt. Bill Wohead, of Mentone, Ind., who said he was in his early 60s, was skeptical of the accusations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly. \u201cYou\u2019re innocent until proven guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil you see some actual charges, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He called the accusations \u201ca big smear campaign from the left\u201d and said he and his family had no plans to abandon Fox News. Some fans were disappointed, even angry, that they had been robbed of their favorite television host. \u201cI was just sitting here thinking about who I could call to say he should be back on the air,\u201d Toni Drugmand, 56, said, at a Starbucks in Phoenix on Tuesday morning. A copy of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s book \u201cKilling Jesus\u201d rested on the table in front of her. And what did she think of the accusations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly? \u201cI think the man has a lot of money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to target anyone who has a lot of money.\u201d \u201cA lot of things are taken as sexual harassment that aren\u2019t ever meant that way,\u201d she added. Mandy Asmus, 75, a resident of Scottsdale, Ariz., was wary of the harassment accusations but did not reject them out of hand. \u201cIf someone is actually accused of it, and they actually did it, you know, that\u2019s different from the way men might talk around the cooler,\u201d she said. She added that, if the accusations were true, \u201cthen he shouldn\u2019t be on TV.\u201d Without Mr. O\u2019Reilly for the first time in 20 years, Fox News reconfigured its prime-time lineup, moving Tucker Carlson from 9 p.m. to Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s 8 p.m. slot. It also moved the ensemble show \u201cThe Five\u201d from the afternoon to the 9 p.m. slot. While the network has long dominated the ratings, the loss of Mr. O\u2019Reilly, its top-rated host, and the changes to its prime-time slate, have Fox News\u2019s rivals sensing an opening to make up ground. But if there was one thing many O\u2019Reilly viewers agreed on, it was this: Despite his departure, and the harassment accusations that led to it, they would still watch Fox News. \u201cWe like their news,\u201d Ms. Asmus, from Scottsdale, said, citing the network\u2019s proclaimed devotion to family values, patriotism and the Constitution. \u201cWe grew up in a different time.\u201d Bijan Nakhjavan, 66, who lives in Miami and was visiting family in Georgia last week, said he thought of Mr. O\u2019Reilly as a \u201cphony guy\u201d who twisted the truth. He said he had watched his show occasionally but considered it more entertainment than news. Still, he said, he planned to watch the network\u2019s new prime-time lineup. \u201cEverybody deserves a shot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch the new people and see what happens.\u201d Younger viewers also said they planned to stick with Fox News. \u201cHonestly, I would probably watch it more,\u201d Paul Johnson, 20, a student at Clemson University in South Carolina, said about the O\u2019Reilly-absent 8 p.m. time slot. \u201cJust because Tuck is so ridiculous sometimes that it\u2019s fun to watch. It\u2019s almost more entertaining than Bill O\u2019Reilly, I think.\u2019\u2019 During a meeting of the University of Notre Dame\u2019s College Republicans on Monday night, Tucker Carlson\u2019s show played on a screen in the corner. \u201cI won\u2019t stop watching the network,\u201d said Christina Herrera, 21, a student at St. Mary\u2019s College in Indiana who was in attendance. But she admitted that the accusations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly had been jarring. \u201cI\u2019m not over it yet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt almost feels like a betrayal, especially as a woman.\u201d Not everyone at the meeting, however, was as keen on Fox News. Eddie Damstra, 19, of Orland Park, Ill., said he wanted to \u201csee how the accusations play out\u201d before committing to the network. \u201cIt seems to be a cultural problem in Fox News,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is true, I\u2019d be less inclined to watch.\u201d Whether the time slot could reach the ratings heights to which \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d had climbed remained to be seen. Mr. Carlson had a strong debut on Monday night, when 3.2 million people tuned in, though viewership settled at about 2.9 million on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. In 2017, Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show averaged 4.0 million viewers. Joe McDonough, 79, a Democrat in Boston and a former Marine, was one O\u2019Reilly viewer who said he did not intend to fill his 8 p.m. hour with Mr. Carlson\u2019s show. He had considered Mr. O\u2019Reilly a hero, he said, and was unwilling to invest time and energy on another television personality \u2014 and on Fox News. \u201cI\u2019m almost 80,\u201d he said, as he read a newspaper on a bench in Boston Common park on Monday afternoon. \u201cI don\u2019t need all that controversy anymore.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/business/media/fox-news-bill-oreilly-viewers-react.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T20:17:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T20:17:16-04:00", "abstract": "While many fans defended Mr. O\u2019Reilly after his departure from Fox News, some network viewers said harassment accusations against him were worrisome.", "title": "Fox Loyalists Feel Robbed of Bill O\u2019Reilly, but Some Viewers Have Doubts"}
