{"text": "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 The former South Carolina police officer who was recorded on video when he opened fire on a fleeing black motorist, killing him, in 2015 will plead guilty on Tuesday, people familiar with the case said. Michael T. Slager, who was a North Charleston police officer when he shot and killed the motorist, Walter L. Scott, will enter his plea in Federal District Court in Charleston. Four people familiar with the case confirmed the existence of an agreement. They insisted on anonymity because the deal has not been announced formally. A lawyer for Mr. Slager, Andrew J. Savage III, did not respond to a request for comment. Ryan Julison, a spokesman for lawyers representing Mr. Scott\u2019s family, said he could not comment on whether a plea agreement was in place. It was not immediately clear which charges Mr. Slager might plead guilty to. He was scheduled to go on trial later this month on charged that he violated Mr. Scott\u2019s civil rights. In December, his murder trial in state court concluded in a mistrial. The charges stemmed from an episode that brought international condemnation. In April 2015, Officer Slager stopped Mr. Scott, 50, for a broken taillight. Mr. Scott fled on foot, and Mr. Slager eventually drew his weapon and fired at Mr. Scott\u2019s back. A pedestrian filmed part of the fatal encounter, and within days Mr. Slager was fired and charged with murder. The City of North Charleston later reached a $6.5 million settlement with Mr. Scott\u2019s family. In his state trial, Mr. Slager testified that he had struggled with Mr. Scott and feared for his life when he began shooting.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/us/michael-slager-walter-scott-north-charleston-shooting.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T09:52:32-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T09:52:32-04:00", "abstract": "Michael T.
