{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "\u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s award-winning book exploring racial injustice in America, will be brought to the Apollo stage next April. Mr. Coates\u2019s fiery work \u2014 which made him the National Book Award winner and a Pulitzer Prize finalist \u2014 will be adapted into a multimedia performance, with excerpted monologues, video projections, and a score by the jazz musician Jason Moran. Portions of Mr. Coates\u2019s letters to his son would be read aloud, while narratives of his experiences at Howard University and in New York City could be performed by actors. Kamilah Forbes, the Apollo\u2019s executive producer, will direct the production. The coming Apollo season will be Ms. Forbes\u2019s first full season in the role; she previously was the associate director of \u201cRaisin in the Sun\u201d on Broadway. And she has a personal connection to the book: She met Mr. Coates when they were both students at Howard, and appears in the book as \u201cAunt Kamilah.\u201d \u201cThe second I put the book down, I wanted to call everyone who had read the book, and who would stay up with me at 3 a.m.,\u201d Ms. Forbes said in a phone interview. \u201cThe hope is that we\u2019re taking that solitary experience of reading the book and expanding that to a collective experience.\u201d Ms. Forbes also knew Prince Jones, a Howard University student who was killed by a police officer in 2000, and whose life and death are explored in \u201cBetween the World and Me.\u201d \u201cIt was hard for me to read the book \u2014 because of my personal connection, but even just broader,\u201d Ms. Forbes said. \u201cPrince was a huge tragedy and loss to us all. Now we\u2019re living in a world where we\u2019re fearing. I think about my brothers, my nephews, my husband, and I fear for their lives. So it\u2019s an even bigger discussion.\u201d Mr. Coates will be involved with the project going forward to give \u201ccreative guidance,\u201d Ms. Forbes said, and may appear in the production. Mr. Moran, meanwhile, has composed music for two recent Ava DuVernay films addressing civil rights, \u201cSelma\u201d and the documentary \u201c13th.\u201d Casting has yet to be announced, but will be fluid over the show\u2019s short run. (Exact dates have not been specified.) \u201cThere\u2019s a mix of everyday folks and celebrity voices,\u201d Ms. Forbes said. \u201cOne night is going to be vastly different from the next.\u201d The Apollo\u2019s coming season, which was announced on Wednesday, will also include \u201cWe Shall Not Be Moved,\u201d a genre-crossing opera directed by Bill T. Jones inspired by a 1985 standoff between police and the black liberation group MOVE in Philadelphia, running Oct. 6-7. The Breakin\u2019 Convention, a hip-hop dance festival, will return Oct. 27-29. And of course, Amateur Night will continue every Wednesday.
