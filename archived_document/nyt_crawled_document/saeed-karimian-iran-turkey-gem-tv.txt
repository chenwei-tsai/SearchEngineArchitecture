{"text": "ISTANBUL \u2014 A dissident Iranian television executive was assassinated in Istanbul on Saturday evening, months after he was sentenced in absentia to a six-year prison term by an Iranian court for spreading propaganda. Saeed Karimian, the owner of Gem TV, a network of television channels that broadcasts in Farsi and other languages, was shot as he drove through an upscale neighborhood of northern Istanbul \u201cminutes after leaving his office,\u201d Gem announced on Sunday. Also killed was his Kuwaiti business partner, whose name has not been released. The assailants fled, and their vehicle was found abandoned and partly destroyed in another part of Istanbul, according to reports by Gem and several Turkish news outlets. Sukru Genc, the mayor of the district in Istanbul where the attack occurred, confirmed the killing in an interview. The attackers\u2019 motive was not immediately clear. Mr. Genc said he had been told by police investigators that Mr. Karimian had been killed because of \u201ca dispute over money.\u201d Mr. Karimian\u2019s company has made dozens of soap operas and holds the broadcasting rights to several famous Turkish dramas. Gem, which has offices in Istanbul and Dubai, has expanded beyond its Farsi programming and also broadcasts in Arabic, Azeri and Kurdish. \u201cAt this stage, all I know is that the most likely motivation behind the assassination could have been financial disputes between Mr. Karimian and his wide networks of business partners from Dubai to Malaysia,\u201d said Ali Vaez, the senior Iran analyst for the Crisis Group, a research institute focusing on international affairs. Others sensed the hand of the Iranian state. The National Council of Resistance of Iran, an exiled opposition group, claimed that Mr. Karimian was assassinated by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard on the orders of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country\u2019s head of state. Iran has been accused of assassinating Iranian exiles in the past, most recently Abbas Yazdi, an Anglo-Iranian businessman who was kidnapped in Dubai in 2013 and is now thought to be dead. In January, an Iranian court announced in a judicial newspaper that Mr. Karimian had been sentenced to six years in prison for spreading propaganda against the country\u2019s Islamic government, and acting against national security. The Iranian government sees westernized entertainment, such as the types of series broadcast by Mr. Karimian, as a threat to the conservative society it has built in Iran since seizing power in a revolution in 1979. While satellite dishes are banned in Iran, they are widely used, and millions of Iranians watch Gem\u2019s programming. \u201cThe regime is very sensitive about culturally subversive media and entertainment broadcast from overseas,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cKhamenei believes this is precisely the U.S. strategy \u2014 to overthrow the Islamic Republic via a soft revolution,\u201d he said. Mr. Karimian had suggested that he hoped his work would change Iranian society. \u201cWe will do our best to create an Iran one day that we can take pride in,\u201d Mr. Karimian said in comments that were broadcast posthumously on his own network on Sunday. Analysts said it was possible that Mr. Karimian might have been targeted by the state. \u201cOne cannot rule out the possibility that he posed a serious threat to a powerful stakeholder in Iran,\u201d Mr. Vaez said. But he added that Mr. Karimian \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit\u201d the profile of someone important enough for the Iranian government to assassinate on foreign soil. The Iranian Embassy in Turkey, the Turkish Foreign Ministry and Gem did not respond to requests for comment.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/world/europe/saeed-karimian-iran-turkey-gem-tv.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T18:52:58-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T18:52:58-04:00", "abstract": "Saeed Karimian, the owner of Gem TV, a network of television channels that broadcasts in Farsi and other languages, was ambushed as he drove through an upscale neighborhood.", "title": "Exiled Iranian TV Executive Is Assassinated in Istanbul"}
