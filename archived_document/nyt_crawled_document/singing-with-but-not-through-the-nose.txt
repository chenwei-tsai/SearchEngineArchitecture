{"text": "Filling the giant Metropolitan Opera House with ringing high notes and without microphones is hard. Doing it with a big piece of foam glued to the end of your nose is even tougher \u2014 especially if you don\u2019t want your tone to conjure thoughts of clothespins or head colds. But that is part of the job description for the tenor singing the title role of Franco Alfano\u2019s \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d an opera about the doomed love of that dashing but nasally over-endowed French Guardsman. So when the star tenor Roberto Alagna arrived in his dressing room at the Metropolitan Opera one morning last week for his first nose fitting in preparation for Tuesday night\u2019s opening, the stakes were high. \u201cThis is more Pinocchio,\u201d he said, dismissing one of two prosthetic proboscises he was offered. Then he turned to the other. \u201cBut this is more Cyrano,\u201d he said. \u201cVery good. Bravo!\u201d The process had started weeks earlier when Met makeup artists made a cast of Mr. Alagna\u2019s face. They then filled the mold with plaster \u2014 recreating the Alagna nose \u2014 and used it to build his stage nose. Now it was time to try out the finished product. Tera Willis, the assistant head of the makeup department, began brushing a sticky adhesive called Pros-Aide onto Mr. Alagna\u2019s real nose, waited for it to become tacky, and then affixed his new Cyra-nose, made of a surprisingly lightweight foam latex. \u201cWe can always cut the holes a little bit more if you feel uncomfortable,\u201d she said. That was no problem, but breakfast was a challenge. Mr. Alagna managed a morning banana easily, but his attempt to drink some coffee was thwarted. Marian Torre, a makeup artist, fetched him a straw. He sipped. Carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult because you can\u2019t have the resonance of the sound,\u201d said Mr. Alagna, who noted that many singers rely on their noses and nasal cavities to make their voices reverberate. \u201cYou have no resonance at all! It\u2019s like putting cotton on a violin.\u201d So for Cyrano \u2014 a challenging role even without foam prosthetics on your face \u2014 he said that he tried hard to focus his sound. \u201cYou must sing very, very concentrated,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you sing too large, you can\u2019t sing this opera.\u201d Francesca Zambello, director of the production, said that all her Cyranos had been good-natured about the nose. \u201cNo one ever protested,\u201d she said, noting that singers often have to sing through masks in works like \u201cDon Giovanni,\u201d \u201cLes Contes d\u2019Hoffmann\u201d and \u201cUn Ballo in Maschera,\u201d which is, after all, about a masked ball. \u201cThat\u2019s the story! You know that you have to do it.\u201d Alfano, who composed \u201cCyrano\u201d in 1936, is best remembered today for composing the ending of \u201cTurandot,\u201d left unfinished at Puccini\u2019s death. \u201cCyrano\u201d fell out of the repertoire; Mr. Alagna said that he fell in love with it after coming across the score in Switzerland. After trying and failing for years to persuade a major company to mount it for him, he decided to put in on himself in Montpellier, France, with his brothers, in 2003. \u201cI paid everything: the set, the costumes, the theater, the singers, the conductor,\u201d he said. (The performance was preserved on a DVD and can be seen on YouTube.) Mr. Alagna said that he identified with the character, who ghostwrites love letters intended for the woman he loves but believes he can never obtain because of his nose. \u201cThe nose is the symbol of a complex,\u201d Mr. Alagna said. \u201cAnd I was like this: very shy, not easy with my body, myself; it was impossible for me to speak with a girl when I was young, even to speak at school.\u201d The Met first mounted \u201cCyrano\u201d in 2005 for Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. Mr. Alagna said that he was performing a somewhat different version, one that he and his brothers devised after working on the original manuscript to restore cuts and high notes that had been transposed over the years. On the title page of the score, the publisher Ricordi notes that it is the Alagna version. In a rehearsal after the fitting, Mr. Alagna sounded very much like himself \u2014 no clothespins sprang to mind. When it was over, he mused that the fake nose had come to feel normal. \u201cWhen you put it away at the end of the show, and look at your real nose \u2014 you have no nose!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/music/singing-with-but-not-through-the-nose.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T17:38:46-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T17:38:46-04:00", "abstract": "For Cyrano \u2014 a challenging role even without foam prosthetics on your face \u2014 the tenor Roberto Alagna said he tried hard to focus his sound.", "title": "Singing With, but Not Through, the Nose"}
