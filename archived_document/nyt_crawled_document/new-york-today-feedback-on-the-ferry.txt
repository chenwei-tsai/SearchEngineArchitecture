{"text": "Good morning on this bright-and-breezy Tuesday. There\u2019s a rough patch of water on the new Rockaway ferry route near Seagate, Brooklyn, where two-foot swells are common. But aside from the few bumpy minutes it took to navigate that stretch \u2014 and one East River boat being taken out of service because of mechanical issues \u2014 it was mostly smooth sailing on the first day of the new ferry line in the city. The seafaring New Yorkers we spoke to on Monday could not have been more pleased with their new commute on the Urban Journey, the name second graders at P.S. 69 bestowed on the ferry that left Rockaway at 5:32 a.m. \u201cIt\u2019s way more relaxing than going underground,\u201d said Jared Utley, 35, an electronics specialist for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Mr. Utley gets free rides on the subway \u2014 a job perk \u2014 but he\u2019s willing to shell out $2.75 to save 15 minutes on his commute to Manhattan. \u201cAnd when the sun comes out, I\u2019m headed up top,\u201d he said, referring to one of the 30 or so seats on the upper deck. \u201cIt\u2019s well worth it.\u201d The amenities aboard include cup holders, a restroom, enough power outlets to limit any bickering among travelers, and a cafe that sells items like black-salt caramel bars and organic kale-apple-ginger juice. As the ferry neared Governors Island on its debut voyage, riders used their coat sleeves to wipe dew from the windows and catch the blurred outline of the Statue of Liberty in the distance. Urban Journey docked at Wall Street at 6:30 a.m., two minutes behind schedule, just as the ferry named Lunch Box was heading to Dumbo on the East River route. \u201cWhat a way to see the harbor,\u201d said Sandra Gaffney, a resident of Breezy Point for more than 50 years. \u201cWith all the water we have in New York this is the only way to travel.\u201d Here\u2019s what else is happening: A delightful day to sit on that upper deck. We\u2019re looking at blue skies (and a calm wind), with a high around 73.

On this week in 1931, President Herbert Hoover switched on the lights to the Empire State Building at the skyscraper\u2019s ceremonial opening. At 1,250 feet, it was the tallest building in the world, costing $52 million to complete. (And it went up quickly. At one point the walls rose at a rate of more than a story a day.) New Yorkers crammed inside on opening day and headed to the observation deck to see the city\u2019s newest and highest view. More than 5,100 of them took in the sight, and The Times wrote that two things stood out: Central Park, which \u201clooked like a small pasture dotted with tiny puddles of rainwater,\u201d and the Chrysler Building, \u201cits spire gilded by the sun, appeared small and like a toy.\u201d The commotion on the deck even attracted attention from down below. At Bryant Park \u201cthe astrologers there abandoned the sun, the moon and the stars to train their bronzed telescopes upon the observatory,\u201d The Times reported.
