On occasion, The Times will pose questions from readers (and pose some of our own) to notable show runners, and post their responses. (Interviews are edited for clarity.) This week, Noah Hawley of FX\u2019s \u201cFargo\u201d discusses Coen brothers references, Burl Ives and aliens. Previously: Scott M. Gimple of \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d Coming soon: Sarah Treem of \u201cThe Affair.\u201d Q. When you were originally pitching \u201cFargo,\u201d did you run into any pushback from a network or even the Coens themselves at the idea for making this series? \u2014 Devan Suber, Atlanta  A. FX was already exploring making it into a series, so they asked me to come in and tell them how I might do it. I basically told them it\u2019s not a series. The movie starts out saying it\u2019s a true story, and at the end Marge has seen this crazy Coen brothers case. She goes to bed and her husband got the 3-cent stamp and tomorrow\u2019s going to be a normal day, which is her reward for having persevered through the case. It seemed disingenuous to me that she would wake up tomorrow and have another crazy case. So I basically said the only way to do it would be an anthology, where very season is a different story with different characters, but that it all adds up to the same sort of feeling at the end of each 10 episodes. Q. At what point did you know the second season was going to be a prequel set in a different decade? A. In the second hour I wrote this anecdote for Keith Carradine, who played Molly\u2019s dad, for him to say, basically just as a former cop, \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen something like what you\u2019re seeing right now, and my advice is don\u2019t go down that road. Because you can\u2019t really turn around once you\u2019re down it.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t until later in the year, as I sat down to write the last two scripts, that I realized that if we were going to do another season, that I could start setting something up that would pay off in the second year. So I included more allusions in Episodes 9 and 10 to the massacre at Sioux Falls and set up a few story points we\u2019d have to match. Q. You\u2019ve talked about how you see the film and the different seasons of the show as various chapters in a Midwest true crime book. Have you started to think about what other chapters would look like? A. I\u2019m starting to think about it. What I look for is a jumping-off point. In our first year that was two men in an emergency room \u2014 one of them has a broken nose and is a very civilized man and the other is the opposite. That feels like a premise you could imagine in a Coen movie and the questions become, who are these two guys? How did the guy\u2019s nose get broken and what happens after they meet? The second year started with, a woman drives home with a man sticking out of her windshield and starts dinner for her husband. Who\u2019s the woman and the husband? Who\u2019s the man in the windshield how did he get there? And what happens after? That\u2019s what I would be looking for in a third iteration. What\u2019s the catalyst? Q. Was it based on the actual case of the woman who ran over a guy and left him in her windshield? A. It\u2019s based on a vague memory of the event. I didn\u2019t go back and research the facts of that case. It\u2019s the sense that truth is stranger than fiction, and that seemed right for us to play with. Q. So far this season, it seems like everyone\u2019s \u201cbad\u201d behavior is due to being victims of circumstance. I know this is \u201cFargo,\u201d but in your world, do practically all people do the wrong thing? Is this your way of saying anyone is capable of violence when they think that\u2019s the only way out? If so, I better get a meat grinder. \u2014 Steve C., Hunt Valley, Md. A. There is the moral spectrum in \u201cFargo,\u201d and you see it in other Coen brothers movies, where you have a very good character on one end and a very bad character on the other. Then in the middle, certainly with Jerry Lundegaard or Lester Nygaard, there\u2019s someone who is on the fence \u2014 a sort of ordinary person who shows us that they\u2019re capable of even greater evil than the villain, on some level. Billy Bob [Thornton] and I used to laugh because people would refer to him as the protagonist of the show, where he\u2019s clearly the villain. They loved him but they hated Lester. Everyone knew Malvo was a scorpion so we could sort of root for him to be bad, but when we met Lester, he was wearing human clothes, so we felt betrayed. Q. You\u2019ve had people like Ted Danson, Bob Odenkirk, Jordan Peele, Keegan-Michael Key, Brad Garrett and Martin Freeman play roles in both seasons of \u201cFargo.\u201d Do you consciously look for actors with comedic backgrounds, given the dark humor in both the show and the film? \u2014 Eduardo Ramos, Chicago A. I love that it\u2019s the kind of storytelling that supports both great dramatic and great comedic actors, but we\u2019re not necessarily using them in the way that you would expect. When we got Bob Odenkirk, for example, I think everyone sort of thought, \u2018Well this character is the comic foil.\u2019 We realized over the 10 hours he\u2019s actually the moral heart of the show, and had this very dramatic arc and was one of the more tragic characters in the season. So when we cast Mr. Key and Mr. Peele or Brad Garrett or Nick Offerman, the role is not just be funny, funnyman. Q. What aspects of the Coens\u2019 oeuvre most appeal to your own sensibilities? \u2014 Nick, New York A. \u201cFargo\u201d is a tragedy with a happy ending. So you need to have that tragic underpinning, that all of this could be avoidable and that\u2019s what makes it tragic. It\u2019s about the use of violence, and the fact that the tension in anticipation of violence and the tension in anticipation of a laugh are sort of the same. Q. What is your approach to incorporating explicit Coen references? A. Some of the homages are built into character dynamics. For example certainly with Karl (Mr. Offerman) and Sonny (Dan Beirne) there\u2019s an echo of \u201cLebowksi,\u201d with John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. It\u2019s not explicit but it\u2019s familiar and comforting to an audience on some level. At other times we\u2019ll have a homage that sets up an expectation. At the end of Season 1 when we jumped ahead a year, suddenly Molly was pregnant, and we had a pregnant woman and a villain in a cabin. She\u2019s going out there to search for him and subconsciously you\u2019re expecting what happens in the movie, and part of you wants that to happen because it was so satisfying in the movie. So when you do something different it creates a tension \u2014 the opposite happens and that\u2019s surprising. Then there are little pieces here and there \u2014 Mike Zoss Pharmacy, or some other smaller Easter eggs for the hard-core fans to find. I never want it to feel heavy-handed or cute. I do sort of agonize over them because I never want to feel like I\u2019m overdoing them, or being too precious about it, or drafting off work I haven\u2019t earned. Q. Did you feel any additional nervousness or pressure after the success of the first season, and the 18 Emmy nominations? \u2014 Daphne Ace A. I would have to, right? But the pressure I put on myself was creative pressure. It was, O.K., this one is very different from the last one so what\u2019s the best execution of this particular story? That became a much more doable task than to try to compete with the commercial or critical success we had in the first year. That\u2019s not something you can consciously duplicate. Q. Who chooses the music and how does the music, often quirky, drive a story line? \u2014 Phil Telford, Dallas A. A great music supervisor named Maggie Phillips helps me find music. A lot of it is things I found as well, like, for instance, the Jeff Wayne \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d disco opera that ends the second episode. That was something I found and it just seemed too good to be true. A song like \u201cChildren of the Sun,\u201d that Billy Thorpe song, that was in the script, the idea of building a sequence in the premiere to that song. Yes it\u2019s 1979, but because it\u2019s 1979 in the Midwest, it\u2019s also kind of 1974. But it\u2019s also kind of 1962 and 1948 at the same time, do you know what I mean? There are people like Jesse Plemons\u2019s character, who really just wants to go back to the \u201950s and be his parents. So we have a Burl Ives song that goes with him, over the montage of Ed cleaning up the garage. What I loved about that one was it starts as a comic throwback song about this guy, who\u2019s trying to get away from this posse, and then in the end he\u2019s singing in a very soulful way. \u201cMay the Lord have mercy on my soul,\u201d as Ed is trying to get the blood out of the floor. It becomes a very emotional and tragic moment. When one piece of music can do that, that\u2019s a great find. Q. Was that you singing \u201cDidn\u2019t Leave Nobody but the Baby,\u201d from \u201cO Brother Where Art Thou,\u201d at the end of the Season 2 premiere? A. That\u2019s the rumor going around. I can neither confirm nor deny it, that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. Another way we create synchronicity with the Coen movies is to repurpose a piece of music you might have heard. In our first year I had our composer do a version of \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d Beethoven\u2019s Ninth, that in \u201cRaising Arizona\u201d was done with yodeling and banjo. We did the steel drums version of it. You may notice a couple others throughout this season. Q. When are we going to understand the alien stuff in the show, or even see aliens? \u2014 Eduardo Rodrigues, Brumado, Bahia, Brasil A. You want the exact minute? Like minute 36 in Episode 8? Q. If you could be as specific as possible. A. There are reasons that stuff is in there that tie into both the time period, the sort of American paranoia of the late \u201970s, and into the Coen world. That concept you see in a lot of their movies: Accept the mystery. Also: Because it\u2019s funny. Think of Javier Bardem\u2019s haircut in \u201cNo Country for Old Men.\u201d I know that they gave him that haircut and then laughed at his face for about 30 minutes. But there\u2019s nothing funny about it in the movie. It\u2019s eerie and unsettling. You see him with that haircut and it\u2019s almost funny, but it\u2019s also creepy because you literally just saw him sever a guy\u2019s jugular. Billy Bob showed up with the haircut he had as Malvo, and I told him, \u201cWhen you showed up with that haircut, I knew we were making the same movie.\u201d Q. Who would win in a fight between Anton Chigurh and Lorne Malvo? \u2014 Taylor Dorsett-Case, Leeds, U.K. A. [Laughs.] I remember this old Japanese comic book, \u201cLone Wolf and Cub.\u201d There\u2019s this moment when two samurai meet on a road, and the whole comic is, in their heads, they see each version of the fight they would fight, and who would win. They never even have to fight. It feels like if Malvo and Chigurh met, they would both know that on some level it would be a draw, mutually assured destruction. It would be a moment between them. There is that archetype, that elemental figure, in the Coens\u2019 work. The lone biker of the apocalypse, or Peter Stormare in \u201cFargo.\u201d You\u2019re almost not sure if they\u2019re human or not. They may have been roaming this landscape since the time of the old gods. I think that\u2019s interesting, and I certainly played into it with Malvo. Q. Or they could all be the same entity. A. It\u2019s the devil in the Garden of Eden. That\u2019s the other paradigm of \u201cFargo.\u201d It\u2019s always a story of basically decent people who are probably in over their heads, facing an evil that, on some level, they can\u2019t even comprehend. How are they supposed to fight it? But they have to, so they do. Q. What continuing role (if any) do the Coen brothers have in the development of the show? \u2014 Dr. James Rustles, Borneo A. On a day-to-day level, they\u2019re not involved. Mostly I try to be as respectful as possible, and keep them in the loop without pressuring them in any way. It\u2019s like, here are the scripts and here are the episodes if you want to read or watch them. If you don\u2019t, my feelings won\u2019t be hurt. Q. Have they ever nixed something you wanted to do? A. No. I suppose they could. How odd it must be on some level: the show comes out and the bus ads are around, and they\u2019re seeing \u201cFargo,\u201d a movie that they made 20 years ago, has this new life as something they\u2019re not really involved with, day to day. Sometimes I think of that, the Kafkaesque quality of what this experience must be for them. Q. What is the best show on TV right now and why? A. I remain a huge \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fan. As someone said, it\u2019s certainly the most show on TV right now. They\u2019ve managed, in a genre world, to create something that completely works as a drama as well. I really liked \u201cMr. Robot\u201d this summer. I thought that was a great start toward trying to do something different on TV, cinematically and story-wise, monkeying around with the unreliable narrator and everything.", "published_date": "2015-11-02T19:00:00-05:00"}
