I was out in Brooklyn the other morning, cooking chicken on a bunch of charcoal grills that my colleagues at The Sweethome are testing for a coming guide to the best ones available. (Watch this space!) The sun was pounding down, the smoke was copious and not really drifting up so much as filling the garden in which we were working, and all of our eyes were stinging and we were drinking cold iced tea and it was really glorious: the first taste of summer 2017. You might try that for dinner tonight. No recipe. Just chicken parts roasted over coals in a brazier (or under the broiler in your oven if you must), painted for the last 15 minutes or so with a barbecue sauce made of nearly a cup of ketchup, something less than a cup of cider vinegar, a handful of brown sugar and a good dusting of smoked paprika if you have it, plain paprika if you don\u2019t, cooked down in a small pot with salt and pepper to taste. Maybe put some cumin in there? Maybe some red pepper flakes or hot sauce? \u201cThis is your world,\u201d Bob Ross used to say. Make it as you like. Soundtrack: Burning Spear, \u201cMarcus Garvey.\u201d Play loud. Serve the chicken with a simple slaw and some potato bread to mop up the excess sauce and to keep your fingers clean. Eat outside if you can. In the middle of the week, such a dinner can be revelatory. It can alter your perception of the week and your place in it. (Nervous about grilling? Here\u2019s my guide to doing it well.) So that\u2019s tonight: a no-recipe dinner in keeping with our Wednesday tradition here at Cooking. Tomorrow you can return to strict instruction and make Martha Rose Shulman\u2019s recipe for orecchiette with tomato sauce and kale (above). Or, if you\u2019re craving fish, you might try Melissa Clark\u2019s recipe for fast Vietnamese caramel bluefish. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t find bluefish. It works very well with mackerel, salmon or even trout. Italian sausage sandwiches might answer later this week as well. Not to mention a platter of thin pan-seared pork chops. (Here\u2019s a version with pea shoot pesto, if you see any at the market.) Make asparagus with miso butter. And a strawberry fool! You could make avocado fattoush with mint vinaigrette. Or grilled leeks with romesco. It is hard living that the world is experiencing right now. The idea here is simply to cook something at the end of a long day of work or leisure (we serve both constituencies!), and make the lives of those you feed marginally better as a result. Thousands more recipes to help you do so are available on Cooking. Go browse among them, and save the recipes that pique your interest to your recipe box so you can locate them later and put them to use. Award stars to the recipes you really like, and leave notes on those that you\u2019ve hacked with substitute ingredients or new methods of cooking. Rare is the recipe that cannot be altered in some way to the good, for the sake of expediency and flavor alike. And if you run into trouble, either with the technology of our site and apps or with the cooking itself, please reach out for help. We are at cookingcare@nytimes.com, always vigilant. Now, how about some lunchtime reading? The Times provides. Here\u2019s Tejal Rao with a quiet, beautiful account of a day in the life of a halal-cart operator in New York City. Here\u2019s Julia Moskin on the raised-rough Boston chef Barbara Lynch, whose memoir, \u201cOut of Line: A Life of Playing With Fire,\u201d has just been released. Here\u2019s Karen Stabiner, on how Harry\u2019s Berries, a fixture of Southern California for 50 years, has prospered by breaking the so-called rules of Big Berry. And, finally, here\u2019s Eric Asimov on fears in the world of beverage alcohol that legal marijuana might harsh the mellow or at any rate cut into the bottom line. (It\u2019s an unfounded fear, say some in the wine game: \u201cWe haven\u2019t actually seen anybody who\u2019s laying down their glass of wine to pick up a bong,\u201d one told Eric. \u201cThere\u2019s room in people\u2019s lives for both.\u201d) I\u2019ll see you on Friday!", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/dining/a-taste-of-summer-newsletter.html", "section": "Food", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "It\u2019s not here yet, but there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t roast some chicken parts, painted with homemade barbecue sauce, and enjoy with a simple slaw.", "title": "A Taste of Summer", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T11:10:05-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
