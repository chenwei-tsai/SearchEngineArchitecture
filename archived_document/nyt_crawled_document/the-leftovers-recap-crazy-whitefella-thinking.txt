{"text": "In 1981, shortly after his wife died, policeman Kevin Garvey Sr. of Mapleton, N.Y., vacationed in Niagara Falls with his son, Kevin Jr. Using the tape recorder his mother gave him before she passed, the younger Garvey recorded conversations with his dad. The two men talked about the parallels between \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, and about how AAA guidebooks are unreliable because they steer travelers to businesses that have made deals with AAA. Decades later, when 140 million people mysteriously disappeared from the Earth, Kevin Sr. lost his grip on his sanity. But he held onto the tape labeled \u201cNiagara 81,\u201d and he listened to it repeatedly, contemplating its meaning. About halfway through this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d that tape warps and unravels after it\u2019s caught in a downpour in the Australian outback. And while the characters on this show have suffered unimaginable losses before, this cassette becoming unplayable is still devastating because, once again, something irreplaceable has been wiped from existence. This week saw the first episode of \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d to focus almost exclusively on Kevin Garvey Sr. Aside from a couple of phone calls with Reverend Matt and his wife, Mary, back in Jarden, Tex., none of the other series regulars appear. And aside from a late plot twist that follows up on last week\u2019s strange epilogue, the story only loosely connects with what\u2019s been happening in this season so far. Instead, the hour follows the wild-eyed, grizzled Kevin Sr. over the course of several weeks as he trespasses his way across Australia, on a mission to save the world. Here\u2019s how that works: Kevin S. believes an apocalyptic flood is coming on the seven-year anniversary of the Sudden Departure; and he also believes that he can prevent it by singing the sacred aboriginal songs of every tribe in specific locations. His major obstacle, though, is that Australians are hypersensitive about both the rights and the rites of their native people, and they don\u2019t take kindly to some American\u2019s barging into off-limits areas to perform stolen rituals. As episode\u2019s the title implies, \u201cCrazy Whitefella Thinking\u201d is in part about the arrogance of an outsider who embraces his messianic delusions at the expense of other people\u2019s feelings and property. A lot of the episode is like a sad caper comedy, as an old coot scrambles from town to town, one step ahead of the authorities, in search of a man named Christopher Sunday who can teach him the last song he needs to keep the End Times at bay. Even when he finally finds Chris, Kevin Sr. tells a rambling story about hallucinogens, a two-week blackout, \u201cThe Itsy Bitsy Spider,\u201d and how a chicken named Tony randomly pecked at the \u201cNiagara 81\u201d tape and gave him a renewed sense of purpose. Then Kevin Sr. tries to fix the man\u2019s air-conditioner and ends up falling off the roof, crushing his host. Throughout the chase, the fugitive stops periodically to read and make notes on Matt\u2019s new gospel, \u201cThe Book of Kevin,\u201d which \u2014 in a further example of Kevin Sr.\u2019s colossal egotism \u2014 is irritating because it\u2019s about the son, not the father. It\u2019s the AAA guidebook all over again: a text that\u2019s meant to be helpful but instead is self-serving. Kevin Sr. is insistent that his boy is really only a minor player in what he knows will one day be recounted as his own heroic saga. So he throws the first draft away, unmindful of the fact that he has the only photocopy. Scott Glenn has quietly been doing great work for the past two seasons in a relatively minor role, and given his own belated showcase, he doesn\u2019t squander it. He gives one of the best performances of a distinguished career, playing a driven lunatic who justifies every dumb, selfish thing he does as an act of supreme self-sacrifice. That mania leads to Kevin Sr.\u2019s getting stranded in the desert, where his tape is destroyed, and where he\u2019s forced by hunger to try to kill and eat his \u201ctotem animal,\u201d the bush snake. Predictably, the snake bites back ... and our spiritual wanderer lapses into a three-week coma. It\u2019s here where this digressive chapter of \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d (sort of) meanders its way back to the main plot. When he passes out from exhaustion, hunger and snake venom, Kevin Sr. collapses against a cross that was placed by one of the women seen at the end of last week\u2019s episode \u2014 the women who kidnapped a local police chief named Kevin, strapped him to a board and drowned him. The rescuer\u2019s name, ironically enough, is Grace. At the end of \u201cCrazy Whitefella Thinking,\u201d Grace tells her guest a painfully tragic story about how her husband departed on Oct. 15, 2011, while she was away at the store, and about how she thought their kids had been taken too, until their dead bodies were found in the wilderness much later. They\u2019d gone looking for her and were killed by the elements. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that Grace becomes captivated by the single page from Matt\u2019s gospel that Kevin tore out and put in his pocket. Desperate for something to believe in, she takes what she needs from \u201cThe Book of Kevin\u201d \u2014 even though her understanding of the words are different from that of the man she swiped them from. That\u2019s the same thing that happened once with John Hinckley Jr. and \u201cTaxi Driver.\u201d And it\u2019s what Kevin did with Christopher Sunday, telling him that he needed his song to stop the rain and shrugging off Chris\u2019s warning that the song was intended to end drought. \u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of interpretation,\u201d Kevin says. If there\u2019s one constant in post-Departure world of \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d it\u2019s that orthodoxy and blasphemy are outmoded concepts. Everything is up for grabs. Anything can be liturgy. (Don\u2019t) Let the Mystery Be: \u2022 The show\u2019s creative team keeps finding the perfect song for every situation, and what\u2019s even more remarkable is how many of them are covers. Depeche Mode\u2019s original recording of \u201cPersonal Jesus\u201d would have been just fine as the theme song to an episode about the rise of a potential new messiah. But Richard Cheese\u2019s jazzy, lounge-y version here works even better. It\u2019s more ersatz \u2014 which means it functions as a comment on the core question of whether either Kevin is divine. \u2022 Another apt song choice, given Kevin\u2019s conversation with Chris: Eddie Rabbitt\u2019s \u201cI Love a Rainy Night.\u201d \u2022 It\u2019s never directly explained, but the scene in the outback in which Kevin Sr. meets a man who says, \u201cThey didn\u2019t take me,\u201d and then immolates himself? Presumably he was in Australia to meet with the organization Mark Linn-Baker represented in last week\u2019s episode. If so, that group refused to shoot its heat-beam at him because he answered \u201cno\u201d when asked, \u201cWould you kill a baby if it would cure cancer?\u201d ... and thus proved himself to be insufficiently zealous for this project, apparently. But if Nora is correct about this bunch, the results of the man\u2019s trip ended up the same anyway: He was incinerated. \u2022 Although HBO provided critics the first seven episodes of this season, I\u2019m only watching one \u201cLeftovers\u201d a week and not peeking ahead. I say that so you\u2019ll know that when I make the following bit of wild speculation, it\u2019s based only on what\u2019s aired so far. (And if you consider fan theories to be spoilers, stop reading now.) So ... could this group of \u201cscientists\u201d who are blasting people to the other world be the Guilty Remnant? If so, are they still acting as chaos agents, disrupting other people\u2019s lives? Are Evie and Meg alive, and still working with them?", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/television/the-leftovers-recap-crazy-whitefella-thinking.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T22:00:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-30T22:00:06-04:00", "abstract": "This week, Kevin Sr. goes a-wandering: What\u2019s a little cultural appropriation when you\u2019ve got a solid messiah complex?", "title": "\u2018The Leftovers\u2019 Season 3, Episode 3: Down Under"}
