{"text": "It began with a jokey Instagram photo of Al Roker, the television personality, getting a little shuteye during a recent night at the opera. \u201cOk,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo I napped a little last night during intermission at @metopera performance of #derrosenkavalier and 1st act...ok and in the 2nd act. Alright, 3rd act, too. C\u2019mon! It was #fridaynight.\u201d You don\u2019t need to be a weatherman to know which way the blowback came from. Some opera fans and singers, perhaps feeling beleaguered at a moment when the art form is struggling to get a toehold in popular culture, saw it as a public slap in the face. Quite a few took to Instagram to criticize Mr. Roker for what they saw as rudeness (some using R-rated words that would hardly win the approval of Miss Manners). The soprano Wendy Bryn Harmer, who sings at the Met, turned the tables, noting that, added together, the various components of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show are longer than \u201cDer Rosenkavalier,\u201d the Strauss opera Mr. Roker snoozed through. \u201cOk,\u201d she replied to his post. \u201cSo I napped a little during the Today show. And then I napped a little more during the never ending Today show. Then I napped during the seventh level of hell/the seventh hour of the Today show. Then I napped a little more when the weather report came on because my 4-year-old could do that job and be equally entertaining. Then I kept napping during the Today Show because it\u2019s TV and TV is a dying art form and no one cares about it. #rosenkavisshorterthanthetodayshow.\u201d Mr. Roker replied: \u201cBut you\u2019re watching that dying art form. Thank you, Wendy.\u201d The Met\u2019s \u201cDer Rosenkavalier,\u201d a starry new production mounted for the diva Ren\u00e9e Fleming to say farewell to one of her signature roles, has been one of the highlights of the season, and a box-office hit: Its three remaining performances are sold out. But some opera fans were worried that Mr. Roker\u2019s post would add to the popular perception \u2014 they would say misperception \u2014 that opera is dull. One poster noted that if he had, in fact, slept through the opera\u2019s third act, Mr. Roker missed \u201cthe sexy chorus members, the nudity and the pole dancing.\u201d (Fact-check: True, the new production contains all of those elements.) Others were more sympathetic, and some responded with their own tales of falling asleep during concerts, blockbuster films or popular Broadway shows. And Mr. Roker was unapologetic. \u201cTo all the outraged opera buffs/fans,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cIf you take yourselves so seriously then you\u2019re the ones playing into a stereotype. The reason I went was because of the talent. But sadly, after a week of getting up at 4 a.m. (yes, my job) by Friday the inevitable happens. Did my posting that picture that my wife took as a joke diminish anyone\u2019s enjoyment in that audience? I doze off in movies, baseball games and church. I\u2019m old and I\u2019m tired but not ashamed of it.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/music/al-roker-sleeping-at-der-rosenkavalier-opera.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T12:23:19-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T12:20:03-04:00", "abstract": "The weatherman and TV host posted a jokey Instagram photo.
