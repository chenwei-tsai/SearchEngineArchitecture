{"text": "If The New York Times offers its readers a first rough draft of history, The New York Times Index has \u2014 since 1913 \u2014 offered its subscribers a precise, concise second draft. Issued in monthly, quarterly and annual installments, the Times Index is much more than its name implies. Yes, it can pinpoint the first story about Donald J. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslims: a medium-length article that began in Column 1 on Page A1, Dec. 8, 2015, accompanied by a photograph. But any search engine gets you that far. What the Index provides is narrative. Context. A journey through the Times Index is like a journey through any great encyclopedia. On your way to finding whatever it was you\u2019re looking for, you will be diverted by a lot else besides, all of it enlightening. \u201cIt\u2019s a living, breathing representation of a whole year at The New York Times,\u201d Beth Ann Boswell, the editor and director of the Times Index, said this week. \u201cIt\u2019s not archaic. It\u2019s a beautiful piece of work.\u201d O.K. So what\u2019s the bad news? The staff of 12 is down to five. All the indexers have left the building. Copy editors are working on the October and November monthly supplements, the October-to-December quarterly and the 1,900-page annual. At the close of business on Friday, The New York Times Index will close after 104 years. The 2016 annual, to be published later this year, will be the last. Before TimesMachine and ProQuest and Google and The Times's own Information Bank, before there were any electronic conduits into newspaper\u2019s historical content, the Index was simply indispensable. There was no other way, except by going through dozens of newspapers page by page, to navigate back issues. Armed with the Index and some microfilm rolls, however, you could jump back in time and just about always land in the right spot. (The Times reprinted or retrospectively compiled indexes covering the years 1851 to 1912, so that there would be an unbroken \u2014 if uneven \u2014 record of every single issue.) \u201cThe number of users has never been estimated, but it surely totals thousands a day,\u201d John Rothman wrote in 1965, when he was the editor. Subscribers included college, high school and general reference libraries; government agencies; newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations; industrial and financial corporations; museums and research institutes; civic groups and labor unions; and accounting, law and advertising firms. At the end, Ms. Boswell said, there were only about 280 subscribers. Apart from the general upending of traditional research methods, the Times Index suffered from a chronic shortage of staff. That led to a backlog that stretched to three years at one low point \u2014 not the kind of delay that wins over new users. Index editors had been trying to stave off the day of reckoning for decades. \u201cFor a long time, it was devalued by many top executives,\u201d said Harvey L. Holmes Jr., the editor from 1978 to 2010. \u201cThey were, quite frankly, trying to get rid of it because of the costs.\u201d Mr. Holmes began as an indexer under Dr. Rothman in 1967. At the time, he said, there were about three dozen indexers and copy editors. That permitted individuals to specialize, as Mr. Holmes did in the topic of space. His pride is still evident in the narrative he crafted for the moon landing of 1969, after the first steps had been taken to move the Index from three-by-five-inch cards onto a computerized database. With abstracts like that, who needed primary sources? \u201cThe No. 1 quality was that you had to be a pretty good writer,\u201d Mr. Holmes recalled. \u201cYou were required to do 40 abstracts a day, sometimes 60, up to 100, under pressure.\u201d Copy editors polished the writing, ensured continuity among the abstracts and reviewed the all-important tags that eventually were translated into subject headings and cross references. To avoid repetition under multiple terms, decisions had to be made about where each abstract fit best. There were a few wide misses. The Stonewall rebellion of 1969, for example, wound up under \u201cHotels, Bars, Motels, Night Clubs and Restaurants \u2014 New York City.\u201d In other cases, however, subject terms can tell you all you need to know. The three current cross-references for the subject \u201cBribery and Kickbacks\u201d are the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA); Sheldon Silver, the former speaker of the New York State Assembly; and Dean G. Skelos, the former majority leader of the New York State Senate. \u201cQuestions and disagreements readily come to light,\u201d a 2004 indexing guide said, \u201cand are resolved by asking your neighbor on the one side for an opinion, then asking your neighbor on the other side for a second opinion, and finally carrying the article to Harvey for the final word, which you then report back to your neighbors.\u201d Indexers and copy editors had to be clairvoyant. \u201cThey must keep in mind,\u201d Dr. Rothman wrote, \u201cthat they are serving not only the users of today but future generations (who, to complicate things still further, are bound to have a different perspective and only too likely to have a different vocabulary).\u201d Take the inaugural Index of January-March 1913. Subject headings included Abyssinia; Bathtub Trust; Jones (\u201cMother\u201d); Kinetophone; Mental Telegraphy; Nicholas, Czar of Russia; Oleomargarine; Pujo Committee of House of Representatives; Social Evil; and White Slave Traffic. Many entries now pose more questions than they answer. \u201cSullivan Gun Law: \u2014 Violations: \u2014 Barlow, Hazel, discharges pistol in muff, is arrested, Jan. 6, 6:2; incriminates Kampf, Mar. 3, 16:1.\u201d But the overarching idea of the Index was sound. \u201cTo the wonderful mass and variety of information that is printed by the daily press there is no key; as a result, the life of the world recorded in the recent past, the period which is most important to men working in the present, is cut off from reference or ordered survey,\u201d a 1913 editorial said in welcoming the Index. And here is Ms. Boswell, more than a century later. \u201cIn terms of content management,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are speaking of a world in delicate balance between lots of good information and an overabundance of information that is not organized.\u201d To underscore the big contribution her small department made in imposing some organization, Ms. Boswell created a six-foot tall book sculpture honoring the last cohort of indexers and copy editors: Jennifer M. Buckley, Eileen M. Guzmich, A. C. Lee, George D. MacDonald, Tina Morales, Nathalie E. Nieves, Jane Rose, Ariana Souzis, Sho Spaeth, Susan Tarbet and Christopher Theokas. The columnist Nicholas Kristof stopped to admire it this week. His office is on the same floor. \u201cIt\u2019s an architectural monument as well as a pillar of Times history,\u201d he said, demonstrating why he\u2019s a columnist. There is certainly no disguising the sorrow of this moment, but Ms. Boswell said she understood the financial realities faced by The Times. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do any good if we stuck around, but there wasn\u2019t any newspaper to index.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/insider/1913-2017-the-record-of-the-newspaper-of-record.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Times Insider", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T11:15:20-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T11:15:20-04:00", "abstract": "For more than a century, The New York Times Index guided readers precisely where they needed to go, and offered concise summaries of world events.", "title": "1913-2017 | The Record of the Newspaper of Record"}
