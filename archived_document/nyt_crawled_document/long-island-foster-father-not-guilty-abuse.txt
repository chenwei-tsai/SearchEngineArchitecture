{"text": "RIVERHEAD, N.Y. \u2014 A Long Island man who opened his home to scores of children with intellectual disabilities and mental illnesses was found not guilty on Tuesday of endangering or sexually abusing eight of the boys placed in his care. The jury returned the verdict after more than a week of deliberations in Suffolk County Criminal Court here. For more than 20 years, the man, Cesar Gonzales-Mugaburu, 60, appeared to be a doting foster father dedicated to raising boys struggling with emotional problems and low I.Q.s whose only refuge was his four-bedroom house in the hamlet of Ridge, N.Y. He was so trusted that New York City\u2019s child welfare agency put 95 boys in his care. Other child welfare agencies sent him more children. But in January 2016, two foster children who were in his care at the time told a caseworker that he had made inappropriate comments to them. After Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu was arrested, others who said he had abused them came forward. The case soon expanded to involve eight boys, each of whom testified at trial to being victimized in a home that Thomas J. Spota, the Suffolk County district attorney, labeled a \u201chouse of horrors.\u201d The boys are now 16 to 29 years old. The 17-count indictment against Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu included charges of predatory sexual assault against a child, criminal sexual acts in the second- and third-degree sexual conduct against a child, endangering the welfare of a child and sexual misconduct involving a dog. He was found not guilty on Tuesday of all of the charges. Some of the boys testified during the trial, which began on March 19 and went to the jury on April 24, that they had reported abuse to social workers and police officers over the years, but the earlier investigations had been quickly closed by the authorities, both the defense lawyer and the prosecutors said. One 29-year-old man said during his testimony that when he lived at Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\u2019s house he would instruct the boys to lie before someone from a social service agency would come for an investigation. Donald A. Mates Jr., Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\u2019s lawyer, said during closing arguments his client had been a strict disciplinarian when dealing with \u201ctroubled\u201d boys, but had not sexually abused them. Mr. Mates sought to sow doubt about the accusers\u2019 credibility, arguing that they had been coached about what to say and asked leading questions by law enforcement officers investigating their accusations. Prosecutors said that Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu got away with his crimes for so long because he targeted boys who he thought were unlikely to be believed.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/nyregion/long-island-foster-father-not-guilty-abuse.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T12:31:33-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T12:31:33-04:00", "abstract": "Cesar Gonzales-Mugaburu, who took in 95 boys over two decades, had been accused of endangering or sexually abusing eight of the boys placed in his care.", "title": "Long Island Foster Father Found Not Guilty of Abusing Boys"}
