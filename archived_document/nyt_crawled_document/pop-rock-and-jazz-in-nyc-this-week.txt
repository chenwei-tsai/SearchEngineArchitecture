The experimental musician Laurie Anderson is headlining this concert in celebration of Highline\u2019s 10th anniversary. Since she started her music career with the stunning electronic opus \u201cO Superman\u201d in 1981, Ms. Anderson has proved an indefatigable force in contemporary art: putting on visual exhibitions around the world, holding residencies at universities, scoring movie soundtracks and continuing to record new music. Despite having a remarkable career of her own to draw from, Ms. Anderson will use this performance to honor another visionary: She plans to feature a guitar drone created by her husband, the musician Lou Reed, who died in 2013.212-414-5994, highlineballroom.com THE BESNARD LAKES at the Bell House (May 4, 8:30 p.m.). Since releasing its debut album in 2003, this often overlooked Canadian five-piece has released five sprawling albums of swirling psychedelic rock that have earned the group frequent comparisons to studio mavens like the Beach Boys and the Beatles. Despite minimal mainstream recognition, the band has carried on undaunted. Its alluring and ambitious techniques \u2014 characterized by heavenly, multilayered harmonies and reverb-soaked guitar riffs \u2014 are on display on its latest album, \u201cA Coliseum Complex Museum,\u201d selections from which are sure to feature in Thursday\u2019s show.718-643-6510, thebellhouseny.com JOJO at Irving Plaza (May 2 and 4, 7 p.m.). The pop singer JoJo, born Joanna Levesque, broke out in 2004 with the rousing girl-power anthem \u201cLeave (Get Out).\u201d But in 2007, her ascendant career was stalled when she became embroiled in a legal battle with her first label, Blackground Records, which eventually released her from her contract in 2013. This headlining tour will feature new music from \u201cMad Love,\u201d only her third studio album, along with one-off songs and material from the mix tapes she released during those difficult years. With Stanaj.212-777-6817, irvingplaza.com THE REVOLUTION at B. B. King Blues Club & Grill (April 28, 8 p.m.) and Webster Hall (May 3, 8 p.m.). Throughout much of the 1980s, the Revolution served as Prince\u2019s nimble backing band (it played on one of his best albums, \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d released in 1984). Now, one year after his death, some members of the band \u2014 Wendy Melvoin, Lisa Coleman, Bobby Z, BrownMark and Dr. Fink \u2014 are coming together for a celebration of his life and legacy. Don\u2019t be surprised if a few special guests pop in to honor his memory, too.212-997-4144, bbkingblues.com212-353-1600, websterhall.com DIANA ROSS at New York City Center (through April 29, 8 p.m.). These days, a public appearance by Diana Ross is almost as rare as a unicorn sighting; at 73, she rarely gives interviews or performs for an audience. But since former President Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, in November, Ms. Ross has been enjoying something of a comeback. Before a headlining performance at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, Ms. Ross is wrapping up a five-night engagement at City Center with shows on Friday and Saturday. Nearly every song on the career-spanning set list is a classic, from Supremes tunes (\u201cWhere Did Our Love Go\u201d) to solo material (\u201cLove Hangover\u201d).212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org ROSTAM at the Bowery Ballroom (May 3, 9 p.m.). Rostam Batmanglij may be best known as a founding member of the Grammy-winning indie-pop outfit Vampire Weekend. But after leaving the group last year and collaborating with artists like Carly Rae Jepsen and Frank Ocean, he is focusing on his own work as a solo artist. Mr. Batmanglij will perform his genre-spanning brand of pop \u2014 which draws on E.D.M., chamber pop and the Iranian sounds of his ancestry \u2014 and perhaps unveil songs from his coming debut studio album. With Deradoorian.212-260-4700, boweryballroom.com KEVIN O\u2019DONNELL JAIMIE BRANCH at Nublu (May 3, 7:30 p.m.). The latest dispatch from Chicago\u2019s avant-garde jazz diaspora is \u201cFly or Die,\u201d the trumpeter Jaimie Branch\u2019s forthcoming debut album. Ms. Branch now lives in Brooklyn, but the record bears the pulpy, melodic sound print of her former home. Her trumpet playing is redolent of Don Cherry, but bolstered by her own suite of extended techniques; it drifts from tuneless clouds to long, coagulated tones. Ms. Branch appears here with the same remarkable quartet of Chicago transplants featured on the album: the cellist Tomeka Reid, the bassist Jason Ajemian and the drummer Chad Taylor. Also on the bill are the James Brandon Lewis Trio, featuring the guest guitarist Anthony Pirog, and Soghost, Jason Nazary\u2019s electro-percussion project.212-505-3474, lpr.com RON CARTER\u2019S 80TH-BIRTHDAY WEEK at the Blue Note (May 2-7, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Mr. Carter, a bassist, is one of the most recorded sidemen in jazz history. He\u2019s also the author of some remarkable \u2014 if rather overlooked \u2014 solo albums, in formats ranging from duets to little big bands. The stately Mr. Carter will celebrate the week of his 80th birthday with concerts alongside an array of collaborators. On Tuesday, he\u2019s in duo with the guitarist Bill Frisell; over the next four days, he will convene various quintets including the likes of Benny Golson, Kenny Barron and Renee Rosnes; and on May 7 he closes the run with his Golden Striker Trio, featuring Russell Malone on guitar and Donald Vega on piano.212-475-8592, bluenote.net/newyork INTERNATIONAL JAZZ DAY WITH JEFFERY MILLER at the National Jazz Museum in Harlem (April 30, 3 p.m.). In celebration of International Jazz Day, headquartered this year in Havana, the pianist Jon Batiste has booked a band of rising musicians to perform at the National Jazz Museum in Harlem, where he is an artistic director. The group features a straight-ahead trio led by the fleet young trombonist Jeffery Miller \u2014 a New Orleans native who\u2019s now studying at Juilliard, and whose name you\u2019re likely to start hearing a lot more.212-348-8300, jazzmuseuminharlem.org NILE PROJECT at Joe\u2019s Pub (April 29, 7 p.m.). The Nile Project was founded as much as a utopian model for social unity as it was an ensemble. It\u2019s a collective bringing together musicians from the 11 countries touched by the Nile River; the group piles together a range of Arab and East African sounds. And in tours throughout the world, the Nile Project lets music play its natural role: stoking an empathic dialogue and revealing common ground. At this performance the Nile Project is likely to play selections from its entrancing new disc, \u201cJinja.\u201d212-967-7555, joespub.org DAVID MURRAY AND CLASS STRUGGLE at the Village Vanguard (May 2-7, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). After living in Europe for many years, Mr. Murray, a tenor saxophonist, is diving back into the New York jazz scene that once called him royalty. Mr. Murray\u2019s waggish improvising and brawny tone have rarely sounded better than on last year\u2019s \u201cPerfection,\u201d on which he performs with the pianist Geri Allen and the drummer Terri Lyne Carrington. For this weeklong run Mr. Murray presents a relatively new ensemble, Class Struggle, featuring Mingus Murray, Mr. Murray\u2019s son, on guitar; D. D. Jackson on piano; and the brothers Rashaan and Russell Carter on bass and drums.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com BOBBY WATSON QUARTET at Smoke (April 28-30; 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Mr. Watson, a seasoned alto saxophonist of buttery tone and lithe inflection, has a new album out, \u201cMade in America.\u201d It features nine original compositions dedicated to often-overlooked figures in African-American history: people like Wendell Pruitt, a Tuskegee airman who was killed while serving, and the actress Butterfly McQueen. Its strutting postbop is enlivened by a top-flight quartet, including the pianist Stephen Scott, the bassist Curtis Lundy and the drummer Lewis Nash. The album came out on Smoke Sessions Records, the label associated with Smoke; the same band will play at that club all weekend.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/music/pop-rock-and-jazz-in-nyc-this-week.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T18:35:54-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T18:35:54-04:00", "abstract": "Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz.", "title": "Pop, Rock and Jazz in NYC This Week"}
