{"text": "The Inheritance: Anne Hillerman\u2019s new novel, \u201cSong of the Lion\u201d \u2014 about a car bombing at a high school basketball game and the deeper plot behind it \u2014 enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 8. If Hillerman\u2019s name sounds familiar, then so should those of her central characters: Lt. Joe Leaphorn, Sgt. Jim Chee and Police Officer Bernadette Manuelito, all of whom appeared in a popular and long-running detective series by Anne\u2019s father, Tony Hillerman, before his death in 2008. \u201cSong of the Lion\u201d is Anne Hillerman\u2019s third addition to the catalog. \u201cMy dad and I never talked about my continuing the series,\u201d Hillerman told me in a recent email. But she and her husband, the photographer Don Strel, did collaborate with him on a nonfiction book (\u201cTony Hillerman\u2019s Landscape\u201d) that was eventually published in 2009, a year and a day after her father\u2019s death. \u201cDon and I did a book tour and, inevitably, the people in the audience asked if Dad had any novels pending for posthumous release,\u201d she said. \u201cI must have been asked the \u2018any more stories coming?\u2019 question a hundred times. When I told them no, I could sense their disappointment. As I healed from the worst of my grief, I realized I desperately missed those stories too.\u201d Before she turned to novels, Hillerman worked as a reporter, editor and reviewer of books and restaurants for a Santa Fe newspaper, The New Mexican \u2014 where her father, as it happens, was once executive editor \u2014 and for a regional edition of The Albuquerque Journal. \u201cI covered lots of different topics,\u201d she said: \u201cthe school board, the Santa Fe Opera, the New Mexico Legislature, some police stuff, the fate of teenage runaways and more.\u201d (Suddenly, her novel\u2019s high school sports angle feels foreordained.) \u201cI miss the intensity of journalism and the camaraderie of a busy office,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I am relishing this midlife career change.\u201d Now Lie in It: For the second week in a row, the top-selling book on the advice list (available online) is Adm. William H. McRaven\u2019s \u201cMake Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life \u2026 and Maybe the World.\u201d A retired member of the Navy SEALs who commanded the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, McRaven originally compiled these tips for the 2014 commencement at the University of Texas, Austin \u2014 the \u201cyear\u2019s best graduation speech,\u201d according to Inc. magazine. Making your bed, he explained, starts the day with a sense of accomplishment. \u201cAnd if by chance you have a miserable day,\u201d he added, \u201cyou will come home to a bed that is made.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/a-daughter-continues-her-fathers-legacy-and-his-series.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T11:46:28-04:00", "abstract": "Since Tony Hillerman\u2019s death in 2008, his daughter Anne has written three new novels starring his characters. \u201cSong of the Lion\u201d is the latest.", "title": "A Daughter Continues Her Father\u2019s Legacy, and His Series", "material_type_facet": "List", "section": "Books", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T11:46:28-04:00"}
