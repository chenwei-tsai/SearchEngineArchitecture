{"text": "TORONTO \u2014 A stuffed Easton equipment bag and a hockey stick were propped against the wall in the chambers of Madam Justice Mara Greene. They made for an odd sight, competing for space with law books and reference material. But it is not unusual for those who know the hockey passion of Greene, who presides over criminal matters at Old City Hall, a provincial courthouse in the downtown core. \u201cI love hockey in a way that I can barely describe,\u201d said the bespectacled Greene, a 47-year-old mother of two who is a bundle of kinetic energy. \u201cI like watching hockey. But I don\u2019t love watching it the same way I love playing it.\u201d Greene is helping to redefine the work-life balance in Canada\u2019s justice system. Along with skating in a women\u2019s hockey league and taking skills lessons, she is an assistant coach of her daughter\u2019s hockey team. Sometimes, when she needs to clear her head, she spends her lunch break skating alone on the outdoor rink at city hall, adjacent to the courthouse. Greene is the only female hockey-playing judge among a roster of about two dozen judges, including 10 women, at the Queen Street courthouse, opening her up for quizzical looks as she totes her equipment into the courthouse and up to her office. \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t have seen that 20 years ago,\u201d said Janet Leiper, 55, a lawyer who plays on a team with Greene on Monday nights. Greene gives only faint recognition to the stark contrast between the austere judge she is by day and the freewheeling player she is by night. She is not alone in her puck pursuits. Two male criminal judges at Old City Hall \u2014 Rick Libman, 60, and Steven Clark, 66 \u2014 play pickup hockey. Judges here have been known to prefer racket sports, cycling or jogging in an effort to maintain a healthy work-life balance. League hockey, because of its intense nature, is relatively uncommon for judges. Age works against them. By the time they are appointed to the bench, they are usually in their later years, and competitive hockey is often shelved for something less physically demanding. Still a few years shy of 50, Greene has a youthful energy, although she is rather late to the game. She took up hockey shortly after being appointed a judge in 2009. When Clark became a judge 15 years ago, there was a different mind-set about how to manage stress. \u201cIt was a work hard, play hard thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the play hard wasn\u2019t playing hockey. The play hard was to go and drink and stay late in your office until your kids are in bed because your wife is looking after that, and then you go home.\u201d The current generation would typically go to the gym, not to the bar, if a trial was shortened. \u201cThat\u2019s our play hard,\u201d Clark said. Leiper, a criminal and administrative lawyer, said women in the Toronto legal community see hockey and other sports as a way to blow off steam. \u201cI think a whole bunch of people realize now that going out drinking is not a sustainable way to manage stress,\u201d Leiper said. She takes a group of women surfing each year in Costa Rica. \u201cWe make sure we get some balance in our lives,\u201d Leiper said. Greene, who has delivered judgments in cases involving sex abuse, human trafficking and unlawful police detentions, receives positive feedback when she is spotted toting her hockey bag and stick around. \u201cShe wears her passion for hockey on her sleeve and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she conceals a hockey jersey under her robes on some days,\u201d the criminal defense lawyer Edward Prutschi said in an email. He said that by such open displays, Greene shows the human side of judges. \u201cWe see them in their black robes, seated up high on a dais, and accord them all the respect and solemnity that the justice system deserves,\u201d Prutschi said. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth remembering that they were people before they were judges.\u201d On the ice, of course, the judges are on an equal footing with defense lawyers, prosecutors and police, who are natural adversaries in the courtroom. The ice is no place to even the score or take out grudges. There is no hitting, even if the letter of the law is not always observed. \u201cIt\u2019s non-contact hockey,\u201d Greene said of her women\u2019s league. \u201cNow,\u201d she pauses for effect, \u201cthere is incidental contact,\u201d she said, emphasizing the word \u201cincidental.\u201d The judge laughed. On Greene\u2019s desk sits a small gavel. Next to it is a rather ordinary-looking puck. But it\u2019s not ordinary for her. It represents her first goal in competitive hockey a couple of years ago. Sometimes, the worlds of hockey and justice collide in her courtroom. Last year, she sentenced the convicted pedophile Gordon Stuckless to six and a half years in prison for crimes that occurred decades ago, when Stuckless was an equipment manager at Maple Leaf Gardens, the former home of Toronto\u2019s N.H.L. team. Using his position of trust, Stuckless lured boys with promises of free hockey tickets. In a twist, Greene takes hockey skills lessons at the same rink, now called the Mattamy Athletic Center. Growing up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Greene was not drawn to the sport, although she had a brother who played. It was only after taking her son to the hockey rink that Greene decided to take an adult skills course. With a friend, she threw caution to the wind and purchased all the equipment before even taking a lesson. \u201cWe were laughing as we\u2019re buying this,\u201d Greene recalled. \u201cWe looked at each other and said, \u2018Are we really going to use this? Are we going to play hockey now?\u2019\u201d Early on, she warned the instructor, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m here today, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to be back tomorrow or next week.\u2019 But I kept coming back. It\u2019s really hard going weekly to something you\u2019re terrible at.\u201d She did not skate well and could not shoot the puck. But Greene saw the value in taking on a new skill, which, as an adjunct professor at Osgoode Law School, is important in understanding her students\u2019 learning struggles. \u201cBy the time we get into our 40s, we stop trying new things,\u201d Greene said. \u201cWe\u2019re used to being competent. All of a sudden being incompetent is really hard. It was really humbling.\u201d Through the learning curve is steep, her ego has not taken a hit. \u201cIn fairness, my self-esteem is not invested in my hockey playing,\u201d she said with a laugh. Greene does not closely follow her current hometown\u2019s team, the Maple Leafs, and pays only passing interest to N.H.L. games on television. Clark, her fellow hockey-playing judge, is a loyal fan of the Montreal Canadiens. The most prized possession in his chambers is a red chair that Clark bought in an auction when the storied Montreal Forum closed in 1996. The seat bears the number 10 in honor of his hero, Guy Lafleur. Clark and Greene have jokingly talked about being warned not to play hockey in the courthouse hallways. Clark said he teases a member of the custodial staff \u2014 a die-hard Boston Bruins fan \u2014 that one day, when the halls are empty, he will take his sticks and ball out of his chambers and turn the courthouse floors into a ball hockey surface. Clark added, with a conspiratorial smile, \u201cThese corridors are perfect for playing ball hockey.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/sports/hockey/toronto-hockey-playing-female-judge.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T18:22:23-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T18:22:23-04:00", "abstract": "Mara Greene, who took up hockey shortly after being appointed a judge in 2009, is helping redefine the the work-life balance in Canada\u2019s justice system.", "title": "Meet Toronto\u2019s Gavel-Wielding, Puck-Shooting Madam Justice"}
