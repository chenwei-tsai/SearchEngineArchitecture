{"text": "A great American president, a mythic Rastafarian musician, a white dog named Duncan and a demonic being with the date of the day after the recent presidential election carved into its chest in scarlet \u2014 these are among the personages that combine and recombine throughout Jason Fox\u2019s cycle of 23 raw portrait paintings at Canada. This excellent show is called \u201cSquare Cave,\u201d which suggests that while we now live in rooms with corners, the Stone Age is not so far behind us, and could come again. As we move around the gallery, clockwise, Barack Obama and Bob Marley (complete with a giant spliff) merge and separate and the dog appears. A head brings to mind Picasso\u2019s \u201cLes Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon,\u201d next Vel\u00e1zquez is seen in \u201cLas Meninas,\u201d at his easel. His canvas has nearly trompe l\u2019oeil textures and tacks, in contrast to the quiet mayhem of Mr. Fox\u2019s paint handling in general. His shingled planes form a compressed Cubism with occasional eruptions of Expressionism. His preference for letting one strong color dominate \u2014 red, green, brown or black \u2014 ropes in modernism\u2019s monochromes. George Harrison makes appearances, especially in the outstanding \u201cAmbassador to England or France\u201d \u2014 all brown with touches of rabid red and a canine visage. The skull-like head and pink shoulders of a figure lying on a slab is titled \u201cSoft Entry,\u201d and evokes both President John F. Kennedy in Dallas and the Dead Presidents, a band. The themes Mr. Fox is continually worrying about include recent American history and its violence; drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll; painting\u2019s past, and his own artistic ambition; and the corrupting power of power. In one painting Mr. Obama is a wise man; in the next he\u2019s a suave red devil. We are reminded that 11/9 is 9/11 backward: A circle has closed but nothing has ceased. Yet these shifting presences and thoughts may all be one long drug-induced dream: In the final canvas, Duncan, the artist\u2019s dog, is curled up asleep in his bed.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/design/last-chance-jason-fox-at-square-cave-gallery.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T13:42:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T13:42:05-04:00", "abstract": "At Canada gallery, politics is the theme of a series of portrait paintings of Barack Obama, Bob Marley, George Harrison and the artist\u2019s dog.", "title": "Last Chance: Jason Fox at Square Cave Gallery"}
