{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here\u2019s the latest. 1. President Trump is pushing for a House vote on a revised health care bill this week, maybe as soon as Wednesday. The White House insists the bill will cover people with pre-existing conditions, but critics say it could become too expensive. We also broke down the winners and losers of the $1 trillion deal in Congress to keep the government open through September. (Spoiler alert: the border wall lost.) _____ 2. The president\u2019s re-election campaign debuted a triumphant TV ad celebrating his first 100 days as a success. But he had a bit of interview trouble. He cut one with CBS short after a question about his unsubstantiated claims that his campaign was wiretapped. And in a separate exchange, Mr. Trump questioned whether the Civil War was necessary. A professor at Princeton called his comments the \u201cheight of inaccurate historical revisionism.\u201d _____ 3. President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said he might be too busy to accept President Trump\u2019s invitation to the White House, an offer that stunned human rights advocates. Thousands of people have been killed in a huge crackdown on the drug trade since Mr. Duterte took office. He\u2019s accused of ordering the killings. Above, Mr. Duterte during a \u201cgood-will visit\u201d with Chinese naval personnel. _____ 4. It was May Day, or International Workers\u2019 Day, which is celebrated around the world with marches and rallies. We collected photos from around the globe. More than 70 people were detained in central Istanbul, above. In the U.S., thousands were expected to protest against Mr. Trump and for workers\u2019 and immigrants\u2019 rights, despite his effort to rebrand May 1 \u201cLoyalty Day.\u201d _____ 5. Hamas is trying to present a more moderate public face. The militant group says it\u2019s open to a Palestinian state along 1967 lines, wants closer ties with Egypt and is watering down anti-Jewish language. Analysts see it as a tack to counter its political rival, the Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, days before he meets President Trump. _____ 6. Tech experts are harnessing their skills to fight \u201cfake news\u201d as Europe gets ready for several important elections. France elects a new president on May 7. A low turnout among the working class could benefit the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, above. _____ 7. A little news about us: We\u2019ve just opened a new bureau in Australia. It\u2019s the first step toward expanding our coverage of the region. Today, our correspondent looks at how President Trump\u2019s volatile behavior in Asia is stirring fear in Australia, which has long been a key U.S. ally. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, above, is scheduled to meet Mr. Trump on Thursday on an aircraft carrier in New York. _____ 8. The latest from TV land: One of the top executives at Fox News was forced out, as the company tries to recover from a sexual harassment scandal. Several lawsuits said Bill Shine, a co-president, above, had enabled the behavior of Roger Ailes, the former chairman who was axed in July. And TV and movie writers could go on strike as early as Tuesday, which would immediately imperil the late-night comedy shows. The last strike, in 2007, lasted 100 days. But our correspondent in Hollywood says studios are in a weaker position now and may be more willing to make a deal. _____ 9. Our transportation reporter, trying to solve the mystery of why New York City\u2019s subway is such a mess, traveled to London to see how it works there. One problem: A badly outdated signal system (seen above in a Greenwich Village station), which controls when trains can move down the tracks. London has the world\u2019s oldest subway, but it runs quite smoothly, with computerized signals on several lines. As ridership swells, it could provide a blueprint for New York and other major cities. _____ 10. Finally, tonight is the Met Gala, also known as Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute benefit. The red carpet should be particularly wild this year. The theme is avant-garde, in honor of Rei Kawakubo, the founder of the Japanese brand Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. Tickets are $30,000 each (O.K., and it\u2019s invitation only.) We\u2019ll have a slide show later tonight, updated in real time as the stars arrive. Above, Beyonc\u00e9 last year. We\u2019re also debuting our new fashion newsletter, Open Thread. Sign up here. And have a great night. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
