{"text": "The artist Korakrit Arunanondchai was talking a mile a minute recently about \u201cwith history in a room filled with people with funny names 4,\u201d his video-and-sculpture show at Clearing, a gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn. \u201cI put all of myself, physically and emotionally, into this,\u201d said the amped-up Mr. Arunanondchai, 30, whose friends call him Krit. His dark hair pulled back, he was seated on a couch in a back room at Clearing, explaining how he surfs among different media and combines them. \u201cInstead of the video being the final product, I think of a film more as a sculpture,\u201d said Mr. Arunanondchai, who will appear in a live performance on May 7. The show features a 23-minute film accompanied by two separate installations, one a grotesque fantasy landscape with lights and fountains \u2014 shells are embedded in the floor \u2014 and one a more demure display of his grandmother\u2019s possessions. There is a man-sized rat suit sitting in one corner, worn by Mr. Arunanondchai and others in the film. He said that the character was inspired by the rat\u2019s prominence in Elizabeth Kolbert\u2019s book \u201cThe Sixth Extinction,\u201d which addresses the mass disappearance of species. \u201cIt would be a dominant species after we\u2019re gone,\u201d said Mr. Arunanondchai, who said he often contemplates \u201cthe collapse of nature.\u201d He mixes the rat images with footage of his grandparents, looking back with uncertainty about the world\u2019s future. \u201cI\u2019m from Thailand, and I\u2019m always thinking about Buddhism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you talk about life, it\u2019s always about transforming.\u201d After growing up in Bangkok, Mr. Arunanondchai moved to the United States to attend the Rhode Island School of Design, then earned an M.F.A. from Columbia. Now he lives in Chinatown and keeps a studio in Ridgewood, Queens. His multimedia approach has been successful, with a solo show at MoMA PS1 in 2014. Klaus Biesenbach, the director there, calls Mr. Arunanondchai a \u201csynesthetic\u201d artist. \u201cHe combines music, sound, fashion, painting, sculpture, cinema in a plot that is both cinematic and biographic,\u201d Mr. Biesenbach explained. \u201cIn his live performances, you nearly have the impression you can hear the colors.\u201d In contrast to his personality, Mr. Arunanondchai\u2019s films are relatively slow and dreamlike \u2014 \u201cmeditative,\u201d he said. He uses a lot of footage taken by drones, which he calls \u201ca spirit viewpoint,\u201d like the garuda, a divine bird in Buddhist mythology that can change into human form. \u201cIt\u2019s invisible but it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt changes our behavior in such an extreme way.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/design/korakrit-arunanondchai-clearing-gallery-bushwick.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:53:23-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:53:23-04:00", "abstract": "Korakrit Arunanondchai\u2019s multimedia work includes a man-sized rat suit, a grandmother\u2019s possessions and thoughts on extinction.", "title": "An Artist Who Talks Fast but Makes Meditative Films"}
