Mr. Spacey, 57, won his Tony in 1991, as a featured actor in \u201cLost in Yonkers.\u201d He has appeared in six Broadway productions, including the 2007 revival of \u201cA Moon for the Misbegotten.\u201d He served for more than a decade as the artistic director of the Old Vic Theater in London. The Tony Awards, which each year honor plays and musicals presented on Broadway, will take place on June 11 at Radio City Music Hall. Much of the ceremony will be broadcast on CBS, starting at 8 p.m. (Some awards are bestowed before the telecast, or during commercial breaks.) The awards are presented by The Broadway League and the American Theater Wing. Mr. Spacey is an unusual choice, following a series of comic and musical performers \u2014 last year\u2019s host was James Corden. But Mr. Spacey has been known to sing on occasion, including in the 2004 Bobby Darin biopic \u201cBeyond the Sea.\u201d He has won two Academy Awards, for \u201cThe Usual Suspects\u201d in 1996 and for \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d in 2000. This year\u2019s awards will honor Broadway shows that have opened between April 29, 2016, and April 27, 2017. Nominations will be announced on May 2. The award broadcast is an important marketing moment for Broadway, introducing many viewers to plays and musicals they may not yet be aware of. And for the individual shows, it is an opportunity to reach a wide audience of potential ticket-buyers. Musicals often spend significant money developing elaborate production numbers for the broadcast.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/theater/kevin-spacey-host-tony-awards.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T13:28:08-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Kevin Spacey Is to Host the Tony Awards", "created_date": "2017-04-18T13:28:08-04:00", "section": "Theater"}
