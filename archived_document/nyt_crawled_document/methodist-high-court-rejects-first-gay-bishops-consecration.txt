{"text": "The United Methodist Church\u2019s highest court has ruled that the consecration of its first openly gay bishop violated church law, compounding a bitter rift over homosexuality that has brought the 13-million-member denomination to the brink of schism. In a 6-to-3 vote made public on Friday, the church\u2019s Judicial Council found that a married lesbian bishop, and those who consecrated her, were in violation of their \u201ccommitment to abide by and uphold the church\u2019s definition of marriage and stance on homosexuality,\u201d according to United Methodist News Service, the church\u2019s publicity arm. \u201cUnder the longstanding principle of legality, no individual member or entity may violate, ignore or negate church law,\u201d the council ruled. \u201cIt is not lawful for the college of bishops of any jurisdictional or central conference to consecrate a self-avowed practicing homosexual bishop.\u201d The court ruled that the bishop, Karen P. Oliveto of Denver, \u201cremains in good standing\u201d pending further proceedings, offering her supporters a glimmer of hope. But it also raised the prospect of a suspension or forced retirement. Bishop Oliveto was elected by the church\u2019s Western Jurisdiction last summer and assigned to oversee about 400 congregations in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho. Her election was immediately challenged by the church\u2019s South Central jurisdiction, which argued that the decision violated the church\u2019s ban on ordaining gay people. The country\u2019s third-largest religious denomination, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention, the United Methodist Church adopted language in 1972 declaring that \u201cself-avowed practicing homosexuals\u201d may not be ordained because \u201cthe practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.\u201d Methodists have debated that language every four years at meetings of the church\u2019s top decision-making body, the general conference. The denomination was deeply divided at its 2016 general conference, but averted fracture when bishops decided to appoint what they called a \u201cCommission on a Way Forward\u201d to propose a solution to the stalemate over issues of sexuality. The church announced earlier this week that a special general conference, in St. Louis in February 2019, would be dedicated to resolving the church\u2019s divisions over sexuality issues. The church\u2019s highest court, the Judicial Council, heard arguments in Bishop Oliveto\u2019s case on Tuesday at a hotel in Newark as more than 150 gay Methodist clergy and their supporters held a prayer vigil nearby and later celebrated communion in the hearing room.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/methodist-high-court-rejects-first-gay-bishops-consecration.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T19:48:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T19:44:58-04:00", "abstract": "The church\u2019s highest court has ruled that the consecration of its first openly gay bishop violated church law, compounding a bitter rift over homosexuality.", "title": "Methodist High Court Rejects First Openly Gay Bishop\u2019s Consecration"}
