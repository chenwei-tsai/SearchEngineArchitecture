More than 500 years later, a nascent Jewish community is planting fresh roots in the Sicilian capital, reclaiming a lost, often painful, history, this time with the aid of the local diocese. Palermo\u2019s archbishop, Corrado Lorefice, has granted the emerging community the use of an unused oratory, to be transformed into Palermo\u2019s first stable synagogue in five centuries. And for many, it\u2019s about time. \u201cThe Jewish community is a part of Palermo, part of its history; Jews were here for 15 centuries,\u201d said Evelyne Aouate, an Algerian-born, Parisian-raised transplant whose deepening exploration of her own roots drove the efforts to find the community a home. Aptly enough, that home will be located in what once was known as the Giudecca, Palermo\u2019s ancient Jewish quarter. The downtown warren of yet-to-be-gentrified ramshackle buildings is filled with narrow streets whose names still recall some of that history, like Piazza Meschita, the Arab word for both synagogues and churches, or Via dei Calderai, for the tinkers and coppersmiths whose shops have lined the street practically forever. A few years ago, trilingual street signs \u2014 in Italian, Hebrew and Arab \u2014 were put up as markers in the area in a nod to the city\u2019s rich past. But \u201cthe Hebrew is wrong, it\u2019s botched\u201d\u2014 a transliteration that doesn\u2019t read right, according to Maria Antonietta Ancona, a retired anesthetist who goes by her Jewish name, Miriam. \u201cThey didn\u2019t translate, but just substituted Italian characters with the Hebrew characters, so it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said. She should know, she began studying Hebrew 10 years ago as part of her conversion to Judaism. Like other members of the nascent Palermo community, Ms. Ancona, who was raised as a Roman Catholic though her father was Jewish, began recovering her roots 30 years ago as part of a \u201cpressing necessity\u201d to embrace her Jewish identity. The new synagogue \u2014 on the Vicolo Meschita, part of an area once occupied by Palermo\u2019s Great Synagogue \u2014 will be housed in a former Baroque oratory known as Santa Maria del Sabato, or Holy Mary of Saturday. It is an unusual name for a church, noted Luciana Pepi, who teaches Hebrew language, culture and philosophy at the University of Palermo, and is also a convert and active member of the local Jewish community. \u201cSome scholars have hypothesized that the name might be related to the memory of the celebration of Shabbat,\u201d the weekly Jewish day of rest, she said. On a recent spring morning, Ms. Pepi, Ms. Ancona and Ms. Aouate \u2014 who spearheaded the efforts to open a synagogue \u2014 fussed at the entrance to the oratory, fumbling with a padlock on a cast-iron gate. Using an oversize key, with some effort, they finally opened a tall, paneled wood door. The three women paused at the entrance, taking in a softly lit nave, where dilapidated wooden seats and peeling yellow paint betrayed decades of neglect. The ornate altar was still in the apse, but sundry statues and crucifixes had already been removed. \u201cHere it is!\u201d said Ms. Aouate, her happiness palpable. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, but there is still a lot to do.\u201d That includes reacquainting Palermo citizens with a history that many didn\u2019t even know they had. For many years \u201chistory books skipped over the city\u2019s Jewish presence, as if trying to cancel it,\u201d Ms. Ancona said. Ms. Pepi added: \u201cPalermo didn\u2019t know its own history.\u201d That has been changing, mostly as a result of Ms. Aouate and a small group of enthusiasts, including Catholics, who 25 years ago founded the Sicilian Institute for Jewish Studies, dedicated to recovering the island\u2019s Jewish identity. \u201cA little at a time we are trying to renew that memory,\u201d Ms. Aouate said. Scholarship, too, has filled in many of the missing blanks of Sicily\u2019s Jewish past. Documents show that Jews were in Sicily at least since the first century A.D., and remained on the island until the 1492 edict. At one point, there were 51 communities here, Palermo being the largest and most important. Historians say the edict affected at least 35,000 Sicilian Jews, including at least 5,000 in Palermo. Some Jews decided to stay, converting to Catholicism against their will. Some \u2014 known here as Marranos \u2014 continued to practice Judaism in secret. Palermo\u2019s municipal archives \u2014 whose late-19th-century grand hall may have been inspired by the Great Synagogue \u2014 recently exhibited mementos of more recent affronts to Sicily\u2019s Jews. They included documents from the years following Mussolini\u2019s 1938 racial laws, showing how the city\u2019s Jews were unceremoniously fired from jobs at the local university and City Hall, in order to \u201cdefend the Italian race,\u201d one document read. It took time for the community to rebuild. \u201cI first arrived here in 1959, and for 20 years I thought I was the only Jew in Palermo,\u201d Ms. Aouate said. Over the years, she met other Jews and in time her elegant Palermo apartment became a point of reference for the community during the holidays. The number of Jews currently living in Palermo remains unclear. \u201cIt depends, because if you think of all the people born of a Jewish mother or a Jewish father, then it\u2019s numerous,\u201d but not everyone considers themselves Jewish, she said. Until now, in any case, there haven\u2019t been enough men to form a regular minyan, the quorum of 10 or more adult male Jews required for communal worship, as is the case in Orthodoxy, the only recognized Jewish stream in Italy. Dedicated tourism may change that because Palermo offers various Jewish sites around town, some harboring signs of past suffering. A mikvah, or Jewish ritual bath, was found below the courtyard of Palazzo Marchesi, which in the 16th century housed the offices of the Inquisition. Later, between 1601 and 1782, the Palazzo Chiaramonte-Steri \u2014 today part of the University of Palermo \u2014 served as the prison and tribunal of the Inquisition. Its walls preserve the anguished scratched scrawls of past inmates, including some in Hebrew. Just over three years ago, Hanukkah candles began to be lighted at Palazzo Steri, a tangible sign of the university and the city\u2019s commitment to the Jewish community. The community\u2019s spiritual leader, the Rabbi Pierpaolo Pinhas Punturello, who is an emissary of Shavei Israel, an organization based in Jerusalem that assists those searching for their Jewish heritage, said that he had noticed a growing interest in the Jewish heritage of Sicily and other parts of southern Italy. \u201cEvery time I go there I meet new people curious about their origins, who want to explore them,\u201d the rabbi said. The synagogue was the natural next step and in June last year, Ms. Aouate, Ms. Pepi and Ms. Ancona asked the archbishop whether an unused church might be available. Three weeks later, Archbishop Lorefice called to offer the oratory. The Rev. Pietro Magro, who is responsible for interreligious dialogue for the archdiocese of Palermo, said that the archbishop had been pleased to reach out to the community in their search for a place of prayer. \u201cThe church of the Virgin of the Saturday seemed right because it\u2019s in the Jewish quarter, and we hope it will be ready soon,\u201d Father Magro said. The restoration is expected to begin shortly; the city will cover most of the costs. The community has another long list of expenses, from the ark for the Torah scrolls to a sophisticated security system, Ms. Aouate said. \u201cAnd we would like a beautiful Menorah!\u201d", "published_date": "2017-04-23T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "abstract": "A budding Jewish community is rediscovering its history in Palermo, and working with the local diocese to open a synagogue in the Sicilian capital.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/world/europe/italy-jews-sicily-expulsion.html", "source": "The New York Times"}
