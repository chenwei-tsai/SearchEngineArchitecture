It was the latest development in the yearslong story of Annie Dookhan, a chemist whose co-workers called her Superwoman because she worked so fast. But she was found to have mishandled drug samples, forged signatures and returned positive results on drugs she never bothered to test, and in 2013, she pleaded guilty to 27 counts, including obstruction of justice, perjury and tampering with evidence. By then, the damage was done. Prosecutors and defenders around the state had already begun the imposing task of figuring out which convictions had been tainted by the failings. Early estimates rose above 40,000. Hundreds of people were released from prison. In January, the state\u2019s highest court ordered district attorneys to produce the lists of people they believe they could reprosecute, were a new trial permitted, and those whose cases they will dismiss. Those decisions were due on Tuesday. On Tuesday afternoon, lawyers combed through spreadsheets inside an ornate courthouse here, and counted 21,587 likely dismissals. They had estimated that prosecutors would not vacate the convictions of 500 to 700 people. \u201cFrom numbers that we\u2019re initially getting, about 95 percent of these tainted drug convictions will be dismissed,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cAnd that is a victory for regular people, for people who\u2019ve been tarnished by these drug convictions.\u201d On Tuesday, lawyers for the A.C.L.U. and the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the agency that provides public defenders in Massachusetts, said the \u201cDookhan defendants,\u201d as they are called, would receive mailings informing them of the status of their cases. \u201cIn many respects, the damage has been done. Jobs have been lost, people have been unable to get jobs, housing has been lost, some people have been deported,\u201d said Anthony J. Benedetti, the organization\u2019s chief public counsel. In Suffolk County, which includes Boston, more than 7,800 cases were expected to be dismissed. \u201cThese are not wrongful convictions,\u201d said Jake Wark, a spokesman for the county\u2019s district attorney, Daniel F. Conley. \u201cThey are cases that could be appealed on procedural grounds.\u201d Ms. Dookhan was sentenced to serve three to five years in prison and was granted parole last year. A message left for Nicholas A. Gordon, the lawyer who represented Ms. Dookhan in her legal case, was not immediately answered. The scandal led drug labs around the country to re-examine their protocols, said Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., the director of the Criminal Justice Institute at Harvard Law School, which has some clients who are affected by the scandal. Mr. Sullivan, who described the wave of dismissals as \u201cwholly unprecedented,\u201d said, \u201cThere will be literally tens of thousands of people whose lives will change.\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
