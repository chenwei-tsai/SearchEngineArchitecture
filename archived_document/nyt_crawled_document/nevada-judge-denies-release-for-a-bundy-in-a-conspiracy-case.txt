A magistrate judge told the son, Mel Bundy, 41, and a co-defendant, Gregory Burleson, 53, that she believed they were a danger to the community and might resist returning to court. They face charges of conspiracy, obstruction, weapon offenses and assault on a federal officer. So far, none of the 19 people indicted in the case have been released since their arrests in recent weeks, including Cliven Bundy. A lawyer for Mel Bundy said his client had carried a flag, not a gun. Mr. Burleson\u2019s lawyer argued that he had gone completely blind in recent months, suffered seizures and used a wheelchair.", "abstract": "A son of the rancher Cliven Bundy was ordered to remain in federal custody on charges stemming from an armed confrontation with government agents in 2014."}
