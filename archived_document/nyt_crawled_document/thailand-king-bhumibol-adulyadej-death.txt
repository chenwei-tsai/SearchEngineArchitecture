He was the only monarch most Thais had ever known, and his death set off widespread grief throughout the country. \u201cHis Majesty was a beloved and revered king,\u201d said Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, head of the military junta that seized power in 2014. \u201cHe unified the hearts of all Thais. It is the greatest loss and despair in the lives of all Thais nationwide.\u201d King Bhumibol, 88, who ascended to the throne in 1946 and became the world\u2019s longest-reigning monarch, helped balance rival political factions, at times giving his blessing to juntas that seized power from democratically elected governments, including the current leadership. His son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, who for years has spent most of his time in Germany and who has a reputation as a jet-setting playboy, is expected to take the throne. It was unclear whether he would have the same moral authority to insert himself into the nation\u2019s contentious politics. On Thursday evening, the crown prince unexpectedly said he was not ready to become king and requested more time to grieve the loss of his father, General Prayuth told reporters. The 64-year-old prince, who has been the royal heir since 1972, wants to wait until an appropriate time to take on the mantle of monarch, the prime minister said. Thailand\u2019s National Assembly, which had been expected to crown a new king, convened in the evening. Members stood in silence for nine minutes \u2014 the king was the ninth in his dynasty \u2014 but adjourned abruptly soon afterward without taking further action. Thai news media reported that Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, the government\u2019s chief spokesman, asked all TV channels to show only the government channel\u2019s programming during a 30-day mourning period. Throngs of people had gathered at Siriraj Hospital on Thursday afternoon as rumors of the king\u2019s death spread. Many wore pink, the color thought to bolster his health, and knelt on the ground to pray for his recovery. At one point, the crowd chanted, \u201cLong live the king.\u201d By then, it was too late. President Obama said in a statement that King Bhumibol, who was born in Massachusetts, was a \u201cclose friend\u201d of the United States. \u201cHis Majesty was a tireless champion of his country\u2019s development and demonstrated unflagging devotion to improving the standard of living of the Thai people,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWith a creative spirit and a drive for innovation, he pioneered new technologies that have rightfully received worldwide acclaim.\u201d General Prayuth said flags would fly at half-staff for 30 days and asked the public to refrain from holding celebrations during that period. Government officials will be in a state of mourning for one year, he said. \u201cEven though we are in sorrow and tears are in our faces, our beloved Thailand and the monarchy must continue,\u201d the prime minister said during an appearance broadcast on all television channels. \u201cDo not let the death derail his majesty\u2019s determination to see his kingdom prosper, the people live in blessedness and be kind to each other.\u201d Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political-science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said King Bhumibol\u2019s accomplishments included helping to develop the nation\u2019s economy and preventing the communist movement from making inroads in Thailand as it swept through neighboring countries. While the last 10 years in Thailand have been volatile, he said, the king\u2019s leadership was especially critical during the height of the Cold War, from the 1950s through the 1970s. \u201cHe has left behind a great nation, a grieving and grateful nation,\u201d Professor Thitinan said. \u201cThere are detractors and critics who might argue that the monarchy has impeded democratic development over the past decade, but in the broader, overarching perspective, Thailand would not be where it is today without this monarchy and this monarch.\u201d Thailand has been divided for years between poor farmers mainly in the rural north and more prosperous urban residents centered in Bangkok. At the same time, Muslims have been fighting a low-level insurgency in the far south for more than a decade, seeking independence from the central government. The military has staged two coups over the past 10 years to oust populist governments that favored the rural poor, first the government led by a billionaire businessman, Thaksin Shinawatra, and later the government of his sister, Yingluck. Part of the rationale for the current government\u2019s remaining in power was to ensure a smooth transition after the expected death of King Bhumibol. The announcement of the king\u2019s passing came about three hours after the official time of death, 3:52 p.m. He died at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, where he had been confined for most of the past few years. He had a number of health problems, including kidney failure, and in his final days was on a ventilator. On Wednesday rumors of his death sent the Thai stock market plunging nearly 7 percent before it recovered somewhat later that day to a loss of 2.5 percent. \u201cEven though the team of doctors tried their best, his illness hasn\u2019t improved and he declined accordingly until 13 Oct. 2016,\u201d the palace said Thursday in its announcement. Although the king\u2019s death had long been anticipated, the reality still came as a shock to many Thais. \u201cI really, really love the king,\u201d said Thanthai Kaenwong, 35, a bartender. \u201cHe is the father of all Thais,\u201d he added. \u201cWe closed our club today to mourn him. But no one is in the mood, anyway.\u201d Wimonsiri Kaewsadet, 39, a Bangkok food vendor, grew teary as she spoke of the king. She said her chest felt tight, her face was numb, and she could not eat. She said her sense of loss was even greater than when her own father died. \u201cMy heart is broken in pieces,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one wished him to go so soon like this. But he was very, very sick. He could not go on. He had endured so much pain.\u201d She said the king\u2019s absence made her feel uncertain about the country\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s the news that no one wants to hear,\u201d she said.", "abstract": "King Bhumibol Adulyadej was the only monarch most Thais had ever known, and his death Thursday set off an outpouring of grief across the nation."}
