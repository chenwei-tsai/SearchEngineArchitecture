{"text": "Do you know Anne Shirley? You would like her. Everybody does. A lively and optimistic survivor with a feverish imagination and unchecked enthusiasms, she is a redheaded outsider who becomes an insider without forsaking her peculiarities or her intelligence. An inadvertent feminist, an unrepentant romantic, a hot-tempered sprite, she\u2019s impulsive, she\u2019s dramatic, she\u2019s smart, she\u2019s funny, she insists on spelling her name with an E at the end because it \u201clooks so much nicer.\u201d She speaks in exclamation marks and italics even when in the \u201cdepths of despair,\u201d which, as an abused child, she knows a thing or two about. She is perpetually seeking \u201ckindred spirits.\u201d She loves trees and stories and nut-brown hair and will burn whatever is in the oven while dreaming about trees and stories and nut-brown hair. She can heal an infant with the croup, but she \u201ccannot tie [herself] down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing\u201d at \u201cthrilling\u201d moments or be asked to eat anything \u201cso unromantic [as boiled pork and beans] when one is in affliction.\u201d She is small and freckled and indefatigable. She is nearly 110 years old. Anne Shirley is the heroine of Lucy Maud Montgomery\u2019s beloved 1908 novel, \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d the chronicle of a spirited but previously unloved orphan taken into the town of Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, Canada, by the unmarried, middle-aged siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. Over a period of years and a nearly endless series of scrapes \u2014 falling off roofs, dyeing her hair green, accidentally intoxicating her best friend \u2014 Anne transforms the hearts of everyone around her while making a home for herself. The book has sold over 50 million copies and has been translated into at least 36 languages. Polish resistance fighters took \u201cGreen Gables\u201d with them to the front; the novel became a part of the Japanese school curriculum in the orphan-filled postwar 1950s; a television show based on the series aired in Sri Lanka; and the book occupies a pre-eminent place in Canada, where \u201cGreen Gables\u201d is taught in school and featured on postage stamps \u2014 a cultural export matched only by hockey and the Mounties. While contemporaneous tales of motherless girls, like \u201cRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,\u201d \u201cPollyanna\u201d and \u201cA Little Princess\u201d have faded from popular memory, Anne has thrived, continuing to connect with audiences as she did with Mark Twain, who once described her as \u201cthe dearest and most lovable child in fiction since the immortal Alice.\u201d Anne is also, to use the blunt jargon of the entertainment business, a strong female character with a pre-existing fan base who recently entered the public domain: an adaptation waiting to happen \u2014 again. The novel and its seven Montgomery-penned sequels have already spawned a silent movie, a talkie and more than half a dozen TV shows, including the particularly adored 1985 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation mini-series starring Megan Follows as Anne and a recently aired PBS version staring Martin Sheen as Matthew. There is also a Japanese anime; a Canadian cartoon; multiple musicals, including Canada\u2019s longest-running one; an authorized prequel novel; and the entire bustling branch of the Canadian tourism industry that is the Anne-obsessed summer season in P.E.I. Starting next month, Netflix, in collaboration with the CBC, will air \u201cAnne With an E,\u201d the latest reimagining of \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d \u2014 this time as an ambitious TV drama. \u201cAnne With an E\u201d is being overseen, written and co-produced by Moira Walley-Beckett, a \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d writer from Canada who also created \u201cFlesh and Bone,\u201d a 2015 Starz series about the physically and mentally brutal field of ballet. Walley-Beckett won an Emmy for writing \u201cOzymandias,\u201d the watch-through-your-fingers episode of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d in which the heroic cop Hank Schrader is slaughtered in the New Mexican desert because of his brother-in-law, the meth lord Walter White. This may seem like a counterintuitive credit for someone updating \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d but it is a signal of the project\u2019s aspirations. Walley-Beckett wants to bring the long-term psychological explorations, story arcs and heady themes of virtuosic TV, as well as its production values, to bear on the lighthearted, primarily episodic novel. What this means in practice is that the cheerful novel has, in Walley-Beckett\u2019s hands, become much darker. Extrapolating from asides in the text, Walley-Beckett has fleshed out minor characters; given major ones back stories; drawn out themes of gender parity, prejudice, isolation and bullying; and emphasized the trauma of Anne\u2019s childhood. On Anne\u2019s first journey to Green Gables in the new TV show, she is still, as in the book, so overcome by the beauty of a drive thick with apple trees in bloom that she renames it \u201cthe White Way of Delight.\u201d But in an invention of the show, she is also overcome by memories of being beaten by her former employer. The resulting seven-episode season, the first of a hoped-for five, all based on the first novel, is an amalgam of that which is expected from Anne Shirley (her buoyancy) and that which makes for prestigious television today (her depths). If you begin to ask why Anne has remained popular for as long as she has, you will get multiple explanations and a bounty of adjectives: She\u2019s curious. She\u2019s hopeful. She\u2019s optimistic. She\u2019s timeless. She\u2019s ahead of her time. She\u2019s imperfect, but perfectly so. She is easy to love. Everything about Anne \u2014 her disposition, her gender, her age, her provenance \u2014 is a rarity for acclaimed television. Tony Soprano, Don Draper, Walter White, Hannah Horvath and the rest of the antihero litany are infamously challenging to love, while Anne\u2019s appeal is as plain as the freckles on her face. When I mentioned to Walley-Beckett that Anne is a straightforwardly winning character, her initial reaction was to defend her as if from an undermining charge. \u201cOh, she has got some antihero stuff, which is fun,\u201d Walley-Beckett said. \u201cShe\u2019s not classically beautiful, and she has a bad temper, and she can be heedless.\u201d But then she agreed that yes, \u201cshe is a highly lovable and yummy pleasure to sit down with at night.\u201d When Walley-Beckett says that Anne has some antiheroic traits, she is not denigrating Anne\u2019s charms. She is making a claim for Anne\u2019s importance in the terms of our television moment, when antiheroes are seen as self-evidently fascinating but a resilient teenage girl who has been adored for over a century might be dismissed as kid\u2019s stuff. Walley-Beckett is, needless to say, hoping that \u201cAnne With an E\u201d will be meaningful to children, and especially young women, but she is very explicit about refusing to pander to them. \u201cMy bottom line is: Go deep and make the show worthy of watching,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are other versions of \u2018Anne\u2019 out there for 5-year-olds.\u201d With her TV series, Walley-Beckett is trying to solve a riddle: If everything about \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d is what prestige TV usually avoids, how do you adapt it in a way that is both sufficiently sophisticated and yet not a betrayal of the source material? Can Anne Shirley, the yummy pleasure who has flourished by cheerfully gliding above her trauma, be transformed into an almost-antiheroine who, in the fashion of contemporary television, has to grapple with her awful past directly? And can she do so while remaining quintessentially Anne? In late November, on the outskirts of Toronto, inside an exacting historical recreation of an 1890s P.E.I. farmhouse \u2014 itself within an old gum factory \u2014 strings of apples, cut carefully into rings, appeared to be drying above a cast-iron stove. Oatmeal-colored laundry rested on a rack beside it. Canned fruits, dilly beans, baskets of parsnips, brussels sprouts and russet potatoes were among the fare in a fully stocked pantry. Dark wood desks were filled with letters ready to be mailed, addressed using quill and ink. Outside the green front door, after a small porch gave way to a yard but before that yard gave way to the poured-concrete floor of the factory, the earth was red. Crushed bricks had been rolled out like a rusty red carpet, the color of the iron-rich sandstone soil of Prince Edward Island. \u201cAnne With an E\u201d was filmed briefly on P.E.I. but spent the majority of its six-month shoot at two locations in Ontario: the gum factory for interiors and a farmstead outside the small city of Pickering for exteriors. At the farmstead, the crew painted and stripped the barn; turned its main floor into a hayloft; sank its electric wires underground; fenced in the paddock; added a porch, a roof and an attic onto the farmhouse; and planted a tall tree \u2014 now dead but stapled with a smattering of autumnal leaves \u2014 just outside, so Anne would have the cherry tree mentioned in the novel to stare at reverently from her bedroom window. Walley-Beckett, who has lived in Los Angeles for the last two decades but was born and raised in and around Vancouver, is meticulous in the way of many accomplished creative people, whose imaginations are matched only by a fanatical patience for detail work. She is so devoted to giving Anne what she called a \u201cdocumentary feel\u201d that she assured me the potatoes in Marilla\u2019s pantry were period accurate. (They were smaller than supermarket behemoths but otherwise unremarkable.) She insisted on making room in the budget for a 10-foot-long burbling creek, built behind a schoolhouse also constructed from scratch, because the novel mentions that Anne and her fellow students put their milk bottles in a brook to \u201ckeep it cool and sweet until the dinner hour,\u201d an evocative detail Walley-Beckett said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t do without.\u201d Yet, on this November morning, Walley-Beckett was settled into a director\u2019s chair inside Matthew Cuthbert\u2019s bedroom, full of the period, right-angled wood furniture that hurts your back just to look at it, watching as Amybeth McNulty, the 15-year-old Irish actress who plays Anne, filmed a scene that cannot be found anywhere in the novel. Walley-Beckett did not use a writer\u2019s room for \u201cAnne,\u201d writing all seven scripts herself, and told me with no little pride that she was \u201calmost completely off book.\u201d To flesh out what she hopes will be an at-least-35-hour series, she filmed new histories for Matthew and Marilla that explain how they wound up emotionally remote and unmarried; reimagined one of the novel\u2019s many spinsters as one-half of a long Boston marriage; conjured an entire character, the Cuthberts\u2019 young farmhand, Jerry, from a few of Montgomery\u2019s sentences; sent Marilla to a progressive parenting group in which \u201cfeminism\u201d is complimentarily defined; aged Anne from 11 to 13; and accentuated Anne\u2019s abusive upbringing while taking countless other liberties with the plot. Walley-Beckett has long white-blond hair and a dancer\u2019s comportment that give her the air of a romantic disguised in bluejeans. She looked on as, in the scene, Anne both lets loose her imagination and is brought up painfully by her past. Perched on a tabletop, Anne stares into a pewter plate as if it were a mirror, imagining herself to be a Princess Cordelia, talking to her servant Griselda about a new ball gown. \u201cI do so appreciate your attentions, Griselda,\u201d she says to her imaginary maid, but increasingly to herself. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to give credit where credit is due. How awful it would be to be in service to people who neglect you and treat you unkindly. I imagine it would make you feel quite small and hopeless and occasionally despairing and sometimes lacking in confidence. I wonder if those feelings ever go away.\u201d Early in the novel, Anne laments: \u201cYou would cry, too, if you were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and found that they didn\u2019t want you because you weren\u2019t a boy. Oh, this is the most tragical thing that ever happened to me!\u201d Her hysteria is so charming that it masks the bleakness of her circumstance, but the circumstances are bleak indeed. Orphaned at 3 months, Anne spends years of her life working \u2014 first for the Thomases, looking after their four young children and avoiding the drunken Mr. Thomas, and then for the Hammonds, who have eight children, including three sets of twins. When Mr. Hammond dies, Anne is sent back to an orphanage. Anne develops her much-heralded imagination visualizing a playmate in a bookcase\u2019s only surviving plate-glass front, so lonely she can find a friend only in her own dim reflection. All these details appear in the book, but Montgomery treats them with such a light touch that they often come to adult rereaders as a surprise, an unexpectedly painful subtext they may not have noticed as children. Walley-Beckett makes it manifest. In \u201cAnne With an E,\u201d Anne is constantly remembering her abuse, filmed in jerky, tightly framed, intentionally disorienting flashbacks of, for example, Mr. Hammond\u2019s dying of a heart attack while beating her with his belt. Crying babies cause her to recall Mrs. Hammond sneeringly describe her as a \u201cmiserable piece of trash.\u201d When she realizes that the Cuthberts do not intend to keep her, instead of exclaiming, \u201cTragical!\u201d as she does in the book, Anne falls to her knees and enters a momentary fugue state. Anne\u2019s imagination and bottomless energy are clearly presented in the TV series as coping mechanisms, a frantic and resourceful means of keeping upsetting memories at bay. \u201cI like imagining better than remembering,\u201d Anne says, always choosing between one and the other. It is Walley-Beckett\u2019s interest in trauma that attracted her to both \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cAnne of Green Gables.\u201d \u201cI am drawn to the psychology of wounded people,\u201d she says, linking Walter White to Anne Shirley like a vulture to a moth: It\u2019s true, they both fly. (To get a further sense of Walley-Beckett\u2019s typical interests: She worked on \u201cAnne With an E\u201d while on location for \u201cThe Grizzlies,\u201d a movie she wrote about teenage suicide in Nunavut territory in the Canadian Arctic.) \u201cI was extremely drawn to what it meant to be an orphan in that time,\u201d Walley-Beckett says, \u201cwhat it meant to not belong, what it meant to be derided and abused and maintain the forthright, determined optimism and point of view that Anne has.\u201d If, in \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d hints of Anne\u2019s suffering occasionally waft by, like feathers that escaped from a down pillow, in \u201cAnne\u201d the feathers hang as heavy as if there had just been a pillow fight. Viewers familiar with the books and previous adaptations may feel when watching \u201cAnne With an E\u201d that the emphasis is on the wrong syllable, while also finding something provoking and substantive in the new pronunciation. Walley-Beckett\u2019s series is recognizably \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d but with a grimmer feel. Anne still, for example, smashes a slate over the head of her future husband, Gilbert Blythe, when he has the temerity to call her \u201cCarrots,\u201d but this is no longer foreplay; it\u2019s the culmination of many weeks of bullying, including by an older boy who calls her a \u201ctalking dog\u201d because she is an orphan. Even the show\u2019s handsome look, which Walley-Beckett developed with the director Niki Caro (\u201cWhale Rider\u201d), is naturalistic and washed-out, evoking sepia despite being in color. Anne\u2019s transformations are easy to see as part of a trend in TV and film, one in which suffering has become indistinguishable from gravitas and even the most cheerful superheroes come complete with psychological baggage. In a world where Superman no longer smiles, Archie Andrews is an ennui-filled singer-songwriter and Belle\u2019s mother in \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d tragically dies of the plague, of course Anne has PTSD. But this new interpretation of Anne also treats a young, female character with the attention and focus often reserved for difficult men and the perversions of their machismo. In emphasizing Anne\u2019s past, Walley-Beckett may be roughing up a sunny tale, but she is also insisting that a plucky 13-year-old girl is as worthy a subject as anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point in doing \u2018Anne\u2019 in a way that\u2019s been done, that\u2019s very charming, teacups and doilies and \u2018Oh, Anne\u2019s in another scrape,\u2019\u2009\u201d Walley-Beckett told me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the most realistic way to show the way a girl like this, from a strange place, with enormous prejudices against her, would move through the world?\u201d If you know only one thing about Anne Shirley, it is most likely that she has red hair. Maybe you can even picture it, braided into pigtails, sticking out from underneath an unfortunate straw hat, as when Matthew first sets eyes on her. In the 1890s, red hair was a symbol of witchiness, ugliness, passion. Anne\u2019s hair immediately establishes her as an outsider, even as it intimates a kinship between her and Avonlea, with its startling red roads. Anne wants nothing so much as to be rid of it. \u201cI can\u2019t be perfectly happy,\u201d she tells Matthew with characteristic drama on their first ride to Green Gables. \u201cNobody could who has red hair. ... It will be my lifelong sorrow.\u201d Anne longs to be beautiful. Not only does she wish for her hair to turn a more dignified auburn, she also tells her best friend, Diana Barry, \u201cI\u2019d rather be pretty than clever.\u201d Praying at Marilla\u2019s behest, she asks God to let her stay at Green Gables and to \u201cplease let me be good-looking when I grow up.\u201d She loves pretty things, because she has had none, and swoons over cherry blossoms, an amethyst brooch and the possibility of one day having a stylish dress with puffed sleeves, which sensible Marilla refuses to make for her. If \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d were written today, it is easy to imagine that over the course of the book, Anne would come to learn that none of these externalities matter: not the color of her hair, not the sleeves of her dress. Instead, in the novel, her hair mellows to the coveted auburn, and Matthew, in a moment of tremendous fatherly kindness, gives her a dress with puffed sleeves. Rather than dispense the message that it\u2019s only what\u2019s on the inside that counts, \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d conveys something more nuanced, that beauty can be a pleasure, that costumes can provide succor, that the right dress can improve your life \u2014 all things that adults know to be true, sometimes, but that we try to simplify for our children. \u201cGreen Gables\u201d is rife with complications like these; it\u2019s an artifact from a different time that, instead of being outdated, speaks to ours in an uncanned, unpredictable voice. Anne has survived for so long because she is more sophisticated than she initially seems. The book, in a manner that is rare for young-adult novels even now, is a celebration of Anne\u2019s intelligence, which is ultimately cherished by her adoptive parents, her community and her future partner, Gilbert \u2014 who is also her closest academic rival and who instead of being threatened by Anne\u2019s brain admires her for it. And yet at the end of \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d Anne quits college and returns to the farm to care for an ailing Marilla, never becoming the writer she wanted to be as a child. This is, perhaps, a disappointing ending (and one that presages a string of follow-up novels in which Anne eventually becomes muted by family life), but it is an honest one: We still live in a world where a woman\u2019s intellect does not preclude her from accruing vast domestic responsibilities. \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d is also a romance, but a slow-burning one. Anne can\u2019t stand Gilbert until the final pages of the first novel, her attentions turned less to love than her friendship with Diana. In the middle of the third novel in the series, \u201cAnne of the Island,\u201d Anne is still putting Gilbert off, rejecting his proposal of marriage. It is not until the beginning of the fifth book, \u201cAnne\u2019s House of Dreams,\u201d by which point Anne has had other suitors and other proposals, that the two are finally married, going on to have seven children. For all her curiosity, imagination and education, Anne eventually arrives at the traditional ending: a husband, a family and all the attendant duties, the nonconforming woman who conforms. But the novels do not present this as either a great tragedy or a great victory. Instead, these choices look a lot like the fraught and difficult compromises of adulthood, in which you might put aside personal desires to care for your mother or modify your career goals to accommodate children. We would flatter ourselves to think that there is anything particularly old-fashioned about Anne\u2019s trajectory. She is a thoroughly modern girl. A few hours after shooting the scene with Princess Cordelia, Walley-Beckett was sitting in her sparsely furnished office, saying hello to her dog, Tiger, a rescue she found on the set of \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d Her show\u2019s costume designer, Anne Dixon, walked in to show her a swatch of muted jacquard covered in embroidered flowers \u2014 very couchlike. It was a candidate for the material that would be used for Anne\u2019s dream dress, the aforementioned surprise gift from Matthew. Walley-Beckett wanted \u201csomething more best,\u201d perhaps in Anne\u2019s favorite colors, \u201cwillow green and azure blue,\u201d which she knew off the top of her head. \u201cBut satin would be too much?\u201d Dixon inquired, before referring to the analogous dress in the 1985 CBC mini-series. \u201cWhen Megan Follows comes out, it\u2019s so ... big.\u201d \u201cEighties polyester?\u201d Walley-Beckett countered, as if polyester were a bad taste in her mouth. This may sound innocuous enough, but to a certain subset of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d fans, those are fighting words. Walley-Beckett\u2019s series is contending with memories not only of the novel, but also of the 1985 mini-series, which is so beloved among a certain group of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d admirers \u2014 probably women, of impressionable age in the \u201980s, perhaps from Canada, where it was one of the highest-rated programs that had ever aired \u2014 that it has surpassed the books as the canonical text. (\u201cCan \u2018Anne of Green Gables\u2019 overcome 30 years of nostalgia?\u201d an article published in The Guardian recently wondered, as if the 1985 series, not the book, were the original.) The mini-series ensorcelled a generation of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d lovers with its own interpretation of Montgomery\u2019s novel, one that was faithful to the tone of the book but emphasized the romance between Anne and Gilbert. If you think of \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d as a love story and swoon at the name Gilbert Blythe, chances are you watched the mini-series. The director, Kevin Sullivan, accentuated the blooming (and admittedly captivating) romance between Gilbert and Anne to the extent that the scholar Susan Drain argued that the novel\u2019s \u201ccareful character-building had been sacrificed to the television love story\u201d in a 1987 academic article titled \u201cToo Much Lovemaking: \u2018Anne of Green Gables\u2019 on Television.\u201d But just as evidence of Anne and Gilbert\u2019s love story exists in the text of the first novel, and was drawn out by Sullivan, so does the trauma that Walley-Beckett stresses. The last book Montgomery wrote in the Anne series, \u201cThe Blythes Are Quoted,\u201d is a structurally experimental and grim volume of poetry and short stories, concerning the death of one of Anne\u2019s children, World War I, adultery and murder. It is so wholly a departure from what came before that it was not published in its entirety until 2009, despite purportedly having arrived on Montgomery\u2019s publisher\u2019s doorstep the day she died in 1942. A bleaker interpretation of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d is further supported by the life of L.M. Montgomery herself. Montgomery\u2019s mother died when she was an infant, and her father left her to be raised by her cold grandparents in Cavendish, P.E.I., the future model for Anne\u2019s Avonlea. A high-spirited young woman, at odds with her caregivers, she nonetheless spent years caring for her aging grandmother, eventually marrying a depressive preacher while contending with her own mood disorder. \u201cMontgomery was a woman who wrote about expansive, sunny worlds,\u201d says the professor Mavis Reimer, an Anne scholar who holds the Chair in Young People\u2019s Texts and Cultures at the University of Winnipeg, \u201cbut she lived in a dark little room.\u201d She may have committed suicide. Her official cause of death was coronary thrombosis, but a note was found by her bed that read, in part: \u201cMy position is too awful to endure and nobody realizes it. What an end to a life in which I tried always to do my best in spite of many mistakes.\u201d But as Margaret Atwood wrote in an essay on the occasion of the \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d centenary, \u201cThe presiding genius of \u2018Anne\u2019 is not the gritty gray Angel of Realism, but the rainbow-\u200bcolored, dove-winged Godlet of the Heart\u2019s Desire.\u201d Montgomery\u2019s life may have been hard, but her writing, purposefully, was not. In another of her novels, \u201cEmily\u2019s Quest,\u201d Emily\u2019s teacher offers his pupil a bit of advice: \u201cDon\u2019t be led away by those howls about realism. Remember \u2014 pine woods are just as real as pigsties and a darn sight pleasanter to be in.\u201d It is not an accident that young readers finish \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d feeling as comforted as the odd child who has found a kindred spirit: They are meant to. You can concede that shaking things up is the creatively fulfilling spirit in which to undertake an adaptation (Say something new!) while also recognizing that adaptations of beloved stories, particularly those worshiped by those sticklers for repetition known as children, will always be subject to reactionary desires (Say something familiar!). We want dear tales to be as we recall them, even as we rely on memories formed when we understood less but could wonder more. It doesn\u2019t matter how accomplished, how polished, how heady and period-perfect \u201cAnne With an E\u201d may be: We want Anne to be as we remember her \u2014 even if we don\u2019t remember her that well. For all the changes that Walley-Beckett has made in adapting \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d she understands this sentiment. \u201cI take nothing away from Anne,\u201d Walley-Beckett insists. \u201cShe is buoyant, she\u2019s optimistic, she\u2019s bright, she\u2019s fiery, she\u2019s sunny, she\u2019s imaginative, she\u2019s curious. I just add in the reality of her history.\u201d And so in addition to drawing out the darkness embedded within the text, Walley-Beckett has also included lovely and entirely concocted moments that match the sweetness of the novel, like when Matthew and Marilla ask Anne to sign her name in the Cuthbert family Bible and make herself, officially, one of them. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we hold hands over a running stream and pledge ourselves to each other as Cuthberts forever, or break our fingers and mingle our blood as a symbol of our lasting devotion?\u201d Anne wonders, by way of asking for a grand ceremony to mark the occasion, before settling instead for a celebratory glass of raspberry cordial and a signature. \u201cWith this pen,\u201d Anne says, her hands shaking, \u201cI take you, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, to be my family forever, to call you mine and to be yours, for always.\u201d Then she writes down her name.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/magazine/the-other-side-of-anne-of-green-gables.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Magazine", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:34-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:34-04:00", "abstract": "A new Netflix series aims to explore the trauma behind the heroine.
