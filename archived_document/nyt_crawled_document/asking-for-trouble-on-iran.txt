Yet amid the confusion, there has been an ominous tendency to demonize Iran and misrepresent the threat it presents. This could lead to an unnecessary and risky confrontation. The administration\u2019s various and conflicting responses to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are a case in point. The deal, one of the Obama administration\u2019s major triumphs, requires Iran to curb its nuclear activities in return for a lifting of economic sanctions. During the campaign, President Trump called it \u201cone of the worst deals I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d and promised to tear it up or renegotiate it if he won the election. Last week, however, a letter from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, signaled Mr. Trump\u2019s intention to stick to the deal. The letter certified that Iran was complying with the agreement, negotiated by five world powers in addition to the United States and Iran. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the agreement with on-site inspectors and advanced technology, reached the same conclusion in its most recent report. However, in the letter, Mr. Tillerson also stressed that \u201cIran remains a leading state sponsor of terror\u201d and said the administration was reviewing whether suspending sanctions continues to advance American interests. Further jumbling the administration\u2019s views, Mr. Tillerson told reporters on Wednesday that the deal \u201cfails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran\u201d and \u201conly delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.\u201d On Thursday, Mr. Trump accused Iran of not fulfilling \u201cthe spirit\u201d of the deal. Yet on Friday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis insisted during a visit to Israel that the deal \u201cstills stands\u201d and that Iran \u201cappears to be living up to their part.\u201d That same day, Mr Trump told The Associated Press that \u201cit\u2019s possible that we won\u2019t\u201d stay in the nuclear deal, The A.P. reported on Sunday. Such sequential confusions are nothing new for Mr. Trump\u2019s headspinning positions on important national security issues. Among those heads spinning are those belonging to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Republicans and Democrats who opposed the deal and thought they had a firm friend in Mr. Trump. One possible reason Mr. Trump has muted his criticism is that the deal has clearly curtailed Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It sharply limits the amount of uranium Iran is permitted to enrich and imposes checks that will allow the international community to know if there is cheating. Further, if America reneges on the deal, it will rightly bear the blame for its collapse and other world powers will be furious. What may concern Mr. Trump when he says that Iran is not fulfilling the \u201cspirit\u201d of the deal is Tehran\u2019s destabilizing role in the Mideast. The agreement was intended to resolve the most dangerous threat \u2014 preventing Iran from getting a bomb. But it did not and probably could not contain Iran\u2019s meddling in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, its support for extremists and its capacity to fan regional tensions. These are legitimate concerns. But Iran is not the only nation roiling the region. And unlike his predecessor, Mr. Obama, who argued that Iran, a Shiite Muslim country, and the Sunni Arab states led by Saudi Arabia must find a way to co-exist, Mr. Trump seems to embrace the Saudi view that Iran should be portrayed in the harshest terms possible. For instance, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, pushed the Security Council on Thursday to focus on the \u201cillegal and dangerous behavior\u201d by the \u201cchief culprit\u201d of regional turmoil, Iran, and its ally Hezbollah. For his part, Mr. Tillerson, in talking to reporters, compared Iran to North Korea, which unlike Iran has produced nuclear weapons, and said that its \u201cprovocative actions threaten the United States, the region and the world\u201d and that the administration \u201chas no intention of passing the buck to a future administration.\u201d Where exactly is Mr. Trump going with this? His comments echo statements used by past presidents when they tried to build a case for military action, as, for instance, against Iraq. This is not the time for such action. Mr. Trump would better serve himself and global stability by developing a strategy that seeks to counter Iran\u2019s destabilizing behavior, but also seeks cooperation where possible. For that, the administration will have to regularly converse with the Iranian government, something that appears not to have happened, even to try to win the release of the businessman Siamak Namazi, and his father, Baquer Namazi, two Iranian-Americans who were sentenced to 10 years in prison by Iran on trumped-up spying charges. To get them out, reduce regional tensions and keep the nuclear deal on track, working with the Iranians is a much more logical choice than bullying them.", "abstract": "Demonizing and bullying Iran is not likely to be as effective as dialogue and seeking cooperation from them."}
