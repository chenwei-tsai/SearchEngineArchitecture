{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cHamas Tempers Extreme Stances in Bid for Power\u201d (front page, May 2): The story of a new Hamas statement of principles, with all the fuss and anticipation, is much ado about nothing. On the core of Hamas\u2019s attitudes and policies toward Israel, nothing has changed. For Hamas, there is only one legitimate authority in the Holy Land. Israel, according to this document, has no rights, no history, no connection and no future. Hamas\u2019s mention of a sovereign state based on the pre-1967 lines would be meaningful if it were accompanied by recognition of Israel and its legitimacy. Instead, Hamas notes that it \u201crejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.\u201d And Hamas still justifies violence, meaning terrorism against the people of Israel. Hamas remains a purveyor of terrorism, rejectionism and anti-Semitism, before and after this document. JONATHAN A.
