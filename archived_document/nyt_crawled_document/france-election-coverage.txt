For the past few months, Times reporters have traveled around France covering the issues at play, the plight of the country\u2019s regions and the abundance of candidates. Here are some of our best articles: The presidential candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon has found himself in deep trouble over payments from public funds to his wife and children. France has a long history of such cozy arrangements, but the revelations about Mr. Fillon tapped a wellspring of anger. _____ France is losing the core of its provincial towns \u2014 dense hubs of urbanity deep in the countryside where Balzac set his novels, prefects issued edicts and citizens shopped for 50 cheeses. Our reporter Adam Nossiter headed to Albi, one of those small towns, whose fates are intertwined with voters\u2019 anxieties about the French way of life. _____ A traditional distaste for the far right appeared to be softening during this campaign. Uncertainties and a sense that mainstream parties have failed to offer solutions to the country\u2019s economic anemia have left the National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, better positioned than at any time in its 45-year history. _____ Ms. Le Pen sought to sanitize the image of the National Front and distance the party from the uglier associations of Europe\u2019s far right. The efforts seemed to have paid off, but the news that two of her associates had longtime links to Nazi sympathizers and the party\u2019s campaign finance scandals raised fresh doubts. _____ The issue of French identity and heritage is at the heart of the presidential campaign. Our Paris bureau chief, Alissa J. Rubin, went to Joinville, a small town in rural France. Graceful old structures there have been stripped \u2014 a vivid illustration of the gradual depopulation of many of the country\u2019s villages, and what some fear is an ebbing away of French traditions and culture. _____ Just as it was in the United States last year, Moscow is accused of orchestrating fake and slanted reports in France to bolster politicians who share the Kremlin\u2019s views and weaken those who do not. _____ An in-depth profile of the former economy minister Emmanuel Macron, one of the front-runners. He has no political party to speak of and has never held elected office, but this 39-year-old former investment banker could become modern France\u2019s youngest president.", "item_type": "Article"}
