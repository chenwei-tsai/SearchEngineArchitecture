{"text": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Al Paslow and Joe Peterson, friends since high school, together surfed the real estate and energy bubbles that buoyed the American economy \u2014 and together endured losing their lucrative jobs when each bubble burst. Mr. Paslow, 61, is a soft-spoken college graduate, Mr. Peterson, 62, a visceral debater who chose work straight out of high school. They both root for the Steelers and squabble about climate change. And 100 days into his presidency, they still share an unshakable faith in Donald Trump: This is the man who can restore the America they miss and cherish, the outsider too rich to bribe and too strong to intimidate. \u201cWhen Joe first told me about Trump, I said no, that guy\u2019s a bragger,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cThen I started listening to him, and I noticed, he\u2019s a billionaire. If somebody comes along and says, \u2018President Trump, I want to keep my plant in China and I want to close my plant here, here\u2019s $50 million,\u2019 he says, \u2018I don\u2019t need your money, mister.\u2019 \u201d I first met them at a Trump rally in October in the Western Pennsylvania town of Ambridge, once the vibrant headquarters of the American Bridge Company, where Mr. Paslow\u2019s mother wound cables during World War II. Mr. Peterson proudly wore his Trump-Pence T-shirt; Mr. Paslow a more modest Trump sticker. They had both been out of work for more than a year, laid off from their jobs in oil and gas exploration with two weeks\u2019 notice, no severance, no pension and no unemployment insurance \u2014 like many American workers, they were independent contractors, without the protections of full employment. And like many American men, they were now depending on their wives\u2019 jobs to get by. Mr. Trump came striding into this bleak landscape and offered them hope. He pledged to the crowd that he would bring back the oil and gas industry the very first day he was in office. \u201cUnbelievably, that is exactly what we wanted to hear!\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cOur hearts were uplifted.\u201d What struck me that day and in conversations over the next several months was how much it meant to them to be heard and seen, and how durable their trust was, once conferred. Here was a celebrity self-proclaimed billionaire who was paying attention to their fate, their town, their battered industry. They are quick to suspect conspiracy and corruption, in their state and in Washington. They thought even Mr. Trump might have his price \u2014 but luckily, it would be too high for most to afford. This amalgam of faith and cynicism still binds them to their president. They may not like his tweets \u2014 \u201cbad,\u201d Mr. Peterson said in his only criticism \u2014 but they consistently give him the benefit of the doubt. They dismiss protesters as sore losers, and pundits who attack policy swings as establishment voices bent on sabotage. Where critics point to promises unfulfilled, they see obstacles that are not their president\u2019s fault. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job \u2014 he needs more help from everybody,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. And if Congress, judges and other naysayers get out of the way, Mr. Paslow said, \u201cthen he might go down as one of the best presidents we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d When fact checkers pounce, the two men see an insistence on petty detail when they know what their president really meant. Mr. Peterson, whose parents voted the straight Democratic ticket, denounced Hillary Clinton as a liar and President Barack Obama as a weakling. Mr. Paslow voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, spellbound by speeches that he said could make you happy and make you cry. In 2016, Mr. Peterson had persuaded his reluctant friend to hear out Mr. Trump, and Mr. Paslow was sold. At a dinner with their extended families in December, the two friends were elated at a victory that took them and their country by surprise. Mr. Paslow\u2019s wife, Adele, was outraged by Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women, and sparred with Mr. Peterson and her own mother, a fervent Trump supporter. By April, though, she was liking most of what she saw, and believes the nation\u2019s president deserved the allegiance of even those who did not vote for him. After the election, Mr. Paslow got a new job researching land titles for oil and gas exploration. He gives Mr. Trump credit for buoying the industry by promising to roll back environmental regulations that stifled growth. Even though Mr. Paslow welcomed the cleanup of a Pittsburgh once so polluted that streetlights went on by noon, he and his friend criticized Obama-era rules they saw as helping scuttle the shale gas boom and putting them out of work. \u201cThere were thousands of rules; you had to wait six, eight months just for paperwork,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cIt cost millions of dollars.\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t drill because the owls were mating,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. Or the bats, Mr. Peterson added. The only work Mr. Peterson has found in 18 months is in West Virginia, and he does not want to move. He was a \u201clandman,\u201d going door to door asking whether landowners were willing to lease plots for drilling and then dispensing checks. But even in Pennsylvania, he says, he received a death threat from a farmer angry that his wife had been approached. He fears West Virginia would be even more hostile. The two friends reminisced about their childhood home on drives through Pittsburgh over the past few months. Though the city has reinvented itself as a center of health care, education and technology, they pointed out the houses that are still boarded up, the old economy and the new bumping up against each other in uneasy coexistence. \u201cThe things that made this country great are disappearing \u2014 factories, jobs, education,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cSomeone could get a job at the mill and live happily ever after. Now it\u2019s Walmart and Best Buy. Come on \u2014 a job at Walmart when you could have had a nice life working at a factory?\u201d Yet they both set their sights at non-factory jobs when they first started out. \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t want me working there because it was bad,\u201d Mr. Peterson said of the mills. Instead, he started out trimming grass at a cemetery and then worked for 20 years in an electric motor repair shop until it folded. Meanwhile, Mr. Paslow set up a company based on researching land titles for the state for eminent domain and highway projects. As the real estate market heated up in the \u201990s, the two friends teamed up to build databases of available loans to refinance at lower rates, which they sold to mortgage brokers. Mr. Peterson remembered making $14,000 for little more than 15 hours\u2019 work. Then real estate foundered, and they had to start over. Mr. Peterson worked at Domino\u2019s and Papa John\u2019s, and set up a small business selling baseball cards. A newly booming oil and gas industry came to the rescue. At one point, Mr. Paslow said, he had 60 people working for him researching titles to make sure owners had no competing claims on land that could trip up companies who wanted to drill. \u201cPeople were hiring their brothers, sisters, ex-wives,\u201d he said. For 10 years, business thrived. \u201cThen the bubble broke, and now we\u2019re talking desperation,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cWe got used to having a constant paycheck, got used to having that job, and we didn\u2019t worry. We lost our zest to go out there and be your own entrepreneur.\u201d Mr. Peterson is slowing down. He battled pneumonia this winter. \u201cI\u2019m looking for more part time than full time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m getting older. Everything hurts.\u201d He is able to consider part-time work because of his wife\u2019s management job at a telecommunications company. Mr. Paslow\u2019s wife owns a laundromat and manages her parents\u2019 apartment rental business. Mr. Paslow is grateful to have work, but he chafes at all the software he has to use, and misses the secretaries who used to help him input data. \u201cIt\u2019s giving me headaches,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re typists.\u201d If they are adrift in a sea of menace, graft and scorn, Mr. Trump is an anchor. \u201cTrump walked in and asked, what you want \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to give you,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. It\u2019s only been 100 days. They still think he can do it.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/sunday-review/these-guys-really-like-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sunday Review", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T14:30:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News Analysis", "created_date": "2017-04-29T14:30:24-04:00", "abstract": "It\u2019s only been 100 days.
