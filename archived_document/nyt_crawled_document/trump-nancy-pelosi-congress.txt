{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The message came in a distant January, at the dawn of a power transfer in Washington \u2014 dictated, like so much would be in due time, by something Donald J. Trump saw in the news. \u201cNancy \u2014 you\u2019re the best,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote to Nancy Pelosi at the beginning of 2007, scribbling on an article about her swearing-in as House speaker after Democrats seized control of the chamber. \u201cCongrats. Donald.\u201d Mr. Trump had a small hand in her elevation. He had made a $20,000 donation to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. A decade later, long after the two first made a gilded acquaintance at Trump Tower in Manhattan, they have emerged from the administration\u2019s first 100 days as partisan foes with divergent policy aims but one common political goal: proving their deal-making clout in a city where each has a history of being underestimated. As Mr. Trump strains to demonstrate progress on his main campaign pledges, he has slogged through his early months with few Sherpas on Capitol Hill, pursuing halting partnerships with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan that have yielded few legislative successes. Ms. Pelosi \u2014 whose hard line on subsidy payments for insurers under the Affordable Care Act helped extract an apparent concession from the White House during recent budget negotiations \u2014 will not help Mr. Trump dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s signature law. She will not shepherd his tax plan, which she has called a \u201cwish list for billionaires.\u201d But with an ideologically shape-shifting president \u2014 and a former speaker seeking relevance in a moment when the title of House minority leader often confers little \u2014 she seems to retain at least a measure of hope that the man she met in his previous political life might re-emerge. \u201cI could be helpful to him,\u201d Ms. Pelosi offered without prompting during an interview last week in her office at the Capitol, saying that she knew how to address some Republicans\u2019 concerns over the Affordable Care Act and would gladly help if they stopped pushing for a full repeal. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to obstruct him.\u201d Political realities make her a highly unlikely partner in the near term. Ms. Pelosi remains an avatar of San Francisco liberalism and progressive excess to Mr. Trump\u2019s base. Mr. Trump remains the most potent proponent of a Republican health bill that Ms. Pelosi recently appraised as \u201cdoo-doo on their shoe, tattooed on their forehead.\u201d Yet for Ms. Pelosi, recent negotiations over government funding have delivered the first meaningful bipartisan exchanges of this Congress \u2014 arriving at a moment when some Democrats have chafed at her continued grip on power, expressing a desire to elevate new voices. (A newly agreed upon budget deal, announced on Sunday night, requires Democratic votes in both chambers to pass.) There have been occasional gestures toward collaboration. In a phone conversation the day after the election, Ms. Pelosi suggested that Mr. Trump meet with a bipartisan congressional caucus on women\u2019s issues. Mr. Trump said his daughter Ivanka should go instead, handing her the phone. A person close to Ms. Trump said she would be happy to attend. Mr. Trump has in many ways made Ms. Pelosi\u2019s job easier by declining to bother much with Democrats so far, binding the minority caucus in opposition. She has called Mr. Trump \u201cone of the best organizers the Democratic Party has ever had\u201d \u2014 a boon of sorts but also a testament, critics say, to an absence of inspiring affirmative leadership from top Democrats in Washington. The president has elevated other Democrats with characteristic name-calling: Senator Chuck Schumer of New York (\u201chead clown\u201d), Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont (\u201ccrazy Bernie\u201d), Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (\u201cPocahontas\u201d). Ms. Pelosi has avoided this fate, mostly. \u201cWhen he lost the health care bill, he called us losers,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cAll right, way to go!\u201d It is not clear if this more gentle treatment reflects Mr. Trump\u2019s assessment of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s importance or a signal of respect for a woman he used to describe privately as a tenacious negotiator, the kind he championed at times in his business life. \u201cHe said she was a very tough leader \u2014 he respected her,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former aide to Mr. Trump. \u201cHe thought that she got a lot over on Bush those last couple years.\u201d One White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Trump administration\u2019s tenuous ties with congressional Democrats, dismissed the notion of any current relationship with Ms. Pelosi, calling it \u201cnonexistent\u201d and suggesting that she was a minority-party leader searching for purpose. But she has, at times, made herself heard. It was Ms. Pelosi who interjected, during Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with congressional leaders days after taking office, to correct his claim that millions of unauthorized immigrants had cost him the popular vote in November. And it was Ms. Pelosi, according to people familiar with the negotiations, who led the charge in recent days to earn assurances from the Trump administration that it would continue making subsidy payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act. The White House had threatened to withhold the payments as leverage. Ms. Pelosi played down any past relationship with Mr. Trump when he was a donor to Democrats, and her office said she had no record of Mr. Trump\u2019s note from 2007. She recalled that former Representative Charles B. Rangel, the recently retired 23-term Harlem congressman, had helped arrange her initial meeting with Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m a likable guy, and he liked everybody,\u201d Mr. Rangel said in an interview. The feeling is no longer mutual. \u201cThe one good thing that Donald Trump does for our great nation,\u201d Mr. Rangel added, \u201cis that he shatters the myth of white supremacy once and for all.\u201d Ms. Pelosi\u2019s public assessments have been nearly as blistering. But she has seemed disinclined to take Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal lightly. During their phone call the day after the election, smarting from Hillary Clinton\u2019s stunning loss, Ms. Pelosi posed a question to the president-elect, noting his upsets in Michigan and Pennsylvania. \u201cWhat did you know?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI saw the hostility,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, according to Ms. Pelosi. She praised Mrs. Clinton for her concession speech, telling Mr. Trump it \u201cmust have been very hard for her to do.\u201d \u201cIt would have been hard for me, too,\u201d she recalled him saying. Holding forth in her office, Ms. Pelosi brandished an instinct for Trumpian adjectives and workday habits. She took stock of his budget (\u201cpathetic\u201d), his praise of the far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen (\u201cI mean, really?\u201d) and his tax proposal (also \u201cpathetic\u201d). She described Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, as \u201cthat poor slob\u201d from television, when she could not recall his name. She interrupted herself at one point to turn to the four TV sets in the room, which play cable news and C-Span on a loop, remarking on the lighting of an interview with Mr. Schumer on CNN. In private, Ms. Pelosi has appeared to discourage members from taking needless swings at Mr. Trump, invoking another presidential obsession, his poll numbers, and informing colleagues that they compare unfavorably to every president\u2019s dating to Dwight D. Eisenhower. \u201cWe have a very clear responsibility to take our shots very carefully,\u201d she said during a whip meeting last week, according to an aide in the room. Mr. Trump\u2019s shaky standing, she added, supplies \u201ca real opportunity for us.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/trump-nancy-pelosi-congress.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T20:10:49-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T20:10:49-04:00", "abstract": "The president and the House minority leader have a common goal: proving their deal-making clout in a city where each has a history of being underestimated.", "title": "\u2018You\u2019re the Best,\u2019 Trump Once Told Pelosi.
