{"text": "Magdalena Abakanowicz, a Polish sculptor who transformed sisal and burlap into brooding forms that evoked the weight of political oppression, the desperation of the individual and the sufferings of the natural world, died on Thursday in Warsaw. She was 86. She died after a long illness, her husband, Jan Kosmowski, said. Ms. Abakanowicz (pronounced ah-bah-kah-NO-vich), who once described her sculpture as \u201ca search for organic mysteries,\u201d first attracted critical attention in the 1960s with free-standing woven works made from sisal that she unraveled from discarded ships\u2019 ropes and dyed. These Abakans, as they became known, were monumental, some more than 15 feet tall, hollow at the core and fitted with slits and folds. Hanging from the ceiling, nearly touching the floor, they resembled shrouds, twisted tree trunks, cocoons or druid priests \u2014 strange forms summoned from the lower depths of the collective unconscious. \u201cLike all of Abakanowicz\u2019s cycles, the \u2018Abakans\u2019 lead outward, away from what they might appear to represent, into psychology and history, toward fundamental links between human beings and nature that are always waiting to be recognized and explored by the imagination,\u201d the critic Michael Brenson wrote in Art Journal in 1995. In the 1970s and \u201980s, Ms. Abakanowicz embarked on a series of smaller-scale burlap works based on the human figure. They confirmed her growing reputation as one of the most original artists to come out of postwar Poland, a sorceress presiding over her own cult, turning out an endless variety of forms that addressed, in mythic terms, the dark forces at work in the 20th century. The stretched stitches and gnarled strands bursting their wrappings in the \u201cHeads\u201d series of 1973-75, part of a grander project called \u201cAlterations,\u201d suggested, in stark terms, psychic distress tipping over into madness. In the series \u201cSeated Figures\u201d (1974-79) and \u201cBacks\u201d (1976-82), Ms. Abakanowicz used the plaster mold of a man to make glued-burlap forms \u2014 headless and armless and sexless \u2014 that she deployed in groups. \u201cSeated Figures\u201d originally consisted of 18 torsos and legs resting on spare metal supports, lined up as though awaiting dire news. The hunched torsos in \u201cBacks\u201d \u2014 as many as 80 arranged in rows and bent over as though in prayer, or obeisance or in anticipation of the lash \u2014 cast a spell all the more powerful for their ambiguity. \u201cThe face can lie,\u201d she told The Los Angeles Times in 2001. \u201cThe back cannot.\u201d Two years after exhibiting 40 \u201cBacks\u201d at the 1980 Venice Biennale, Ms. Abakanowicz told The Chicago Tribune: \u201cI was asked by the public: \u2018Is it about the concentration camps in Poland?\u2019 \u2018Is it a ceremony in old Peru?\u2019 \u2018Is it a ritual in Bali?\u2019 To all these questions, I could answer yes because my work is about the general problems of mankind.\u201d Her imagination was fecund, whether working with burlap or, in later years, stone, tree trunks or bronze. \u201cEmbryology\u201d (1976-82), the final series in \u201cAlterations,\u201d grew to include nearly 700 forms, soft burlap eggs ranging size from pebbles to boulders that looked like enormous Idaho potatoes. She executed 106 standing figures, each nine feet tall, for \u201cAgora,\u201d which was installed in Grant Park in Chicago in 2006. \u201cI turn sculpture from an object to look at into a space to experience,\u201d Ms. Abakanowicz told The Chicago Tribune in 2005. \u201cEvery sculpture can be turned into decoration. But if you have 100, you are confronted by them and must think and imagine and question yourself. This is what I want.\u201d Her art grew from difficult circumstances. She was born Marta Abakanowicz on a country estate in Falenty, southwest of Warsaw, on June 20, 1930. Her father, Konstanty, the son of a czarist general, was of Russian, Polish and Tatar extraction, his last name derived from a forebear, Abaqa Khan, who was Genghis Khan\u2019s great-grandson. When the Russian Revolution broke out, Konstanty fled to Poland with a brother after the rest of the family was killed. Her mother, the former Helena Domaszowska, belonged to a noble landowning family, and Marta grew up on an estate about 125 miles east of Warsaw left by her grandparents. War brought ruin and horror. In 1943, drunken German soldiers burst into the family\u2019s home and shot Marta\u2019s mother, severing her right arm below the shoulder. She survived, but as Soviet troops advanced in 1944, the family relocated to Warsaw. Marta was recruited as a nurse\u2019s aide, treating the wounded when German troops put down the futile uprising of the Polish Home Army and laid waste to the city. After the Communists assumed power, the family moved to Tczew, outside Gdansk, to avoid being identified as class enemies. Marta studied at the fine-arts lyceum in Gdynia and, after graduating in 1949, spent a year at the Gdansk Academy of Fine Arts, then located in Sopot. Around this time, seeking to break with her past, she began using the name Magdalena. In 1950, pretending to be the daughter of a clerk, she enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, where she studied painting after being rejected for the sculpture program. It was an unhappy time. Socialist Realism, the only approved style, ran counter to her experimental tendencies, expressed in large-scale watercolors and gouaches on stitched-together bedsheets that depicted semiabstract biomorphic forms. \u201cIn Poland it was almost forbidden to talk about mystery,\u201d she told The New York Times in 1992. \u201cI did.\u201d After graduating from the academy in 1954, she designed material for ties at a silk factory and, in a tiny one-room apartment, continued to paint. In 1965 she married Mr. Kosmowski, a civil engineer. In 1960, a show of her work at the Kordegarda Gallery in Warsaw was not allowed to open after a cultural official deemed it formalist. As luck would have it, the eminent tapestry artist Maria Laszkiewicz peeked inside and, seeing the fiber-art works that Ms. Abakanowicz had included in the show, added her name to a list of artists to be included in the first Biennale de la Tapisserie in Lausanne in 1962. She also allowed Ms. Abakanowicz to make use of her basement workshop and looms. For the biennial, Ms. Abakanowicz submitted \u201cComposition of White Forms,\u201d in which she used old clothesline to create a rough abstract surface. Three years later she won the gold medal at the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial. Chafing at the limits of fabric art, she began to conceive of her work in sculptural terms and created the first Abakans, initially one at a time and later in groups. Works like \u201cBois-le-Duc\u201d (1970-71), a \u201cforest\u201d series of overlapping black, brown and reddish panels 26 feet tall, and \u201cBlack Environment\u201d (1970-78), a grouping of 15 hulking black forms, brought her international attention, especially after she was chosen to represent Poland at the 1980 Venice Biennale. Exhibitions in Los Angeles and Pasadena, Calif., introduced her to an American audience in the early 1970s, and in 1982 the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago organized a traveling retrospective of her work. Ms. Abakanowicz began using metal in the late 1980s for works like \u201cBronze Crowd\u201d (1990-91) and \u201cPuellae\u201d (1992). In her most explicitly political series, \u201cWar Games,\u201d begun in 1989, she used tree trunks rejected as unfit for lumber and, after attacking them with an ax and chain saw, fitted them with steel blades and casings. Some looked like severed human limbs, others like fearsome weapons. Fear, passivity, aggression, suffering \u2014 Ms. Abakanowicz stayed true to her themes, leaving viewers to draw their own conclusions. \u201cEverybody can discover in them what he wants to,\u201d she told The Chicago Tribune. \u201cVery seldom is the interpretation against my feelings. Most of the time it is something I can accept.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/arts/design/magdalena-abakanowicz-sculptor-of-brooding-forms-dies-at-86.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T13:04:30-04:00", "abstract": "The Polish artist\u2019s works ranged from woven shrouds and tree trunks to mythic human figures that evoked the dark forces at work in the 20th century.", "title": "Magdalena Abakanowicz, Sculptor of Brooding Forms, Dies at 86", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "section": "Arts", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T13:04:30-04:00"}
