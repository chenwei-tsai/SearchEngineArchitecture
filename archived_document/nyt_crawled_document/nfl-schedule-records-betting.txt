{"text": "Sports are unpredictable. But if you want to make a successful educated guess about a team\u2019s future, remember this rule: Good teams get worse, and bad teams get better. This concept is called regression toward the mean, and is commonly applied to the stock market, but it is also surprisingly robust in many sports applications. South Point Casino just released its win projections for the 2017 N.F.L. season. Each team is predicted to win a certain number of games, and bettors can put money on whether the actual number of wins is over or under that figure. Oddsmakers certainly looking at teams\u2019 schedules and rosters when they set their numbers. But they also seem to intuitively understand regression to the mean. The top seven teams in the league last year, which each won 11 or more games, are all forecast to fall next season. And the biggest falls are expected from the best teams: The Patriots, who won 14 games, are projected to win 11\u00bd. The Cowboys (13-3) are at 9\u00bd. The Chiefs (12-4) are projected to win only nine. Part of the reason is a ceiling effect. Even though the Patriots are almost always good, they cannot win more than 16 games in a season, making it tough to set an over/under at 14 or 15. But most of the reason is the expectation that great teams, even the Patriots, tend to slide downward. In contrast, the nine worst teams last season are all expected to be better. Again, the biggest improvements are expected from the worst teams, led by the Browns, who were 1-15, but are expected to win about four and a half next season. All of these teams will not follow the pattern. But in aggregate, they are virtually certain to. In 2015, there were seven 11-win teams. Only two of them won more games the next season, the Patriots and the Chiefs. Three of them had losing records. Of the 11 teams with six wins or fewer, only four, the Bears, the Niners, the Jaguars and the Browns, got even worse. The others all improved, and three of them won 10 games or more, the Dolphins, the Giants and the Cowboys. Do the win totals for the coming season give us a clue as to which teams will be able to resist the gravity of the mean this season? The Seahawks, who were 10-5-1 last year, are projected to win 10\u00bd, making them the best team that is not forecast to decline. One possible reason is that they made the Super Bowl after the 2013 and 2014 seasons and many feel that their comparatively weaker records the past two years were anomalies. Likewise, the Packers, who won 10 games, are projected to maintain their strength and win 10 again. They have won at least 10 games in seven of the last eight seasons. Another team the bookmakers like is the Ravens. They were 8-8 last year, but are projected to win nine and a half next season. This projection is a little more puzzling. The Ravens do have a fairly easy schedule and get to play the Browns twice. Among last year\u2019s strugglers, the Bills were least favored. They won seven games in 2016, but their over/under for next season is six. That makes them the only team with a losing record projected to be even worse.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/sports/football/nfl-schedule-records-betting.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T08:25:33-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T08:25:33-04:00", "abstract": "In an example of regression toward the mean, a casino projects that 2016\u2019s top seven N.F.L. teams will all win fewer games next season while the nine worst teams all win more.", "title": "Will Your N.F.L.
