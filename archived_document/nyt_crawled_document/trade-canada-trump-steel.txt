But his outburst in the Oval Office toward a friendly neighbor punctuated a week when tough talk on trade took center stage in a White House deeply divided over how aggressively to erect the trade barriers that Mr. Trump promised during his campaign. From Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbuy American, hire American\u201d rallying cry in Wisconsin this week to Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s warnings to Japan and South Korea about the need to rewrite trade deals, the Trump administration is moving against free trade on multiple fronts. A senior White House official said there would be two trade-related events a week for the next few weeks. \u201cHe\u2019s manically focused on these trade issues,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist. The flurry of activity amounts to a comeback by nationalists like Mr. Bannon, who views trade as crucial to Mr. Trump\u2019s populist appeal but whose star has dimmed after clashes with globalist-minded aides like Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs banker and lifelong Democrat who is head of the National Economic Council. The outcome of the debate between nationalists and globalists remains far from settled. Last week the globalists appeared to be winning when the administration decided not to formally designate China a currency manipulator, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to do so during the campaign. Mr. Trump also offered President Xi Jinping of China other concessions on his trade agenda in return for China\u2019s help in curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. But the nationalists scored an early victory when Mr. Trump fulfilled one major trade promise only three days after taking office. He pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade pact negotiated by President Barack Obama, declaring that the era of multinational trade deals was over. After that, the president\u2019s \u201cbark quieted down,\u201d said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cNow the volume of the bark is going back up.\u201d \u201cBut these are still barks,\u201d he added. \u201cSo far, no bites.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s steel investigation is much broader than dozens of anti-dumping cases against China and other exporters filed by the Obama administration and its predecessors. It invokes a somewhat novel principle of using national security as the criterion for whether the imports are damaging the United States. The narrow argument is that a depleted American steel industry would be unable to produce enough steel to supply the military. More broadly, White House officials say an economically vibrant country is better able to defend itself. It is unclear what steps Mr. Trump will take once the investigation is completed \u2014 within 270 days but probably sooner. The most obvious would be to impose tariffs on steel imports. Mr. Hufbauer said the United States could also use the results as leverage to persuade countries to accept voluntary export restraint agreements, such as those in the 1980s. \u201cWe are groping here to see whether the facts warrant a comprehensive solution to deal with a very wide range of products from a very wide range of countries,\u201d Wilbur L. Ross, the secretary of commerce, told reporters on Thursday. Mr. Ross\u2019s department will run the investigation. While the directive does not single out any country, the Chinese are clearly in the cross hairs. China accounts for only 2 percent of direct steel exports to the United States, but its excess capacity drives down steel prices worldwide. Surplus Chinese steel, shipped to other countries, ends up in the United States in other manufactured products. Mr. Ross noted that steel imports from China had continued to rise, despite the government\u2019s pledge to cut back its overcapacity. Still, the White House\u2019s competing aims with China were on display as it rolled out the order. When Mr. Trump was asked whether the investigation would affect his efforts to obtain Chinese cooperation on North Korea, he replied: \u201cThis has nothing to do with China. This has to do with worldwide, what\u2019s happening. The dumping problem is a worldwide problem.\u201d Critics of the administration questioned its invocation of national security. Most of America\u2019s largest steel suppliers are friendly countries, like Canada, South Korea and Germany. Analysts also noted that the value of steel imports declined 26 percent from 2015 to 2016, though the White House noted that imports rose 20 percent between February 2016 and February 2017. \u201cThe U.S. has long criticized trading partners for abusively invoking national security as an excuse for trade protectionist actions, most recently China for its new cybersecurity law,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, a trade adviser to President George W. Bush who is now at Rock Creek Global Advisors. \u201cThe administration\u2019s action may render it subject to the same charge.\u201d Mr. Trump seemed unconcerned about that. Flanked by chief executives from American steel companies, he said the dumping of steel into the American market posed a threat not only to the economy but also to the military, which depends on steel for tanks, ships and planes. \u201cThis is not an area where we can afford to be dependent on other countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have a product where we actually need foreign countries to be nice to us in order to fight for our people. And that\u2019s not going to happen any longer, believe me.\u201d In Asia, Mr. Pence brought a similarly blunt message, warning Japan and South Korea that the administration would seek new bilateral trade deals with them. Mr. Ross, a billionaire known for his hard-line trade views and investments in failing steel companies, joined Mr. Pence in Tokyo. The Japanese were sufficiently worried that they sought to exclude him from some of the higher-level meetings, an official said. With Mr. Trump scheduled to attend a meeting of the Group of 7 countries in Sicily next month \u2014 his first foreign trip as president \u2014 some administration officials predicted that Mr. Cohn and Mr. Kushner would try again to moderate his language on trade. But if Mr. Trump\u2019s performance Thursday was any indication, he remains as seized by the subject as he was on the campaign trail. In two weeks, he noted, the White House will present its ideas for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cNafta, whether it\u2019s Mexico or Canada, is a disaster for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster, it\u2019s a trading disaster.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s disparagement of Nafta led to his unexpected sideswipe of Canada. The president had a cordial meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Mr. Trudeau even took his daughter, Ivanka, to a Broadway show. None of that spared the Canadians from the president\u2019s anger over how they protect their dairy industry \u2014 an issue that flared up after 75 dairy farmers in Wisconsin lost their main milk buyer because of a trade dispute with Canada. \u201cI was in Wisconsin the other day,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done to our farm workers is a disgrace. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d", "abstract": "The president ordered an investigation into steel imports, scoring a victory for his administration\u2019s nationalists in a debate that remains far from settled.", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T22:15:47-04:00", "title": "Trump Roars Again on Trade, Reviewing Steel and Chiding Canada", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/business/trade-canada-trump-steel.html"}
