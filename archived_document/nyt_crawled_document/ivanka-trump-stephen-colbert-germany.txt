What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. The late-night hosts had a lot to say after Ivanka Trump was jeered in Germany for telling a conference on women\u2019s issues that her father was a \u201ctremendous champion of supporting families.\u201d Trevor Noah got a visit from his main muse, Donald J. Trump. Well, actually the Trump impersonator Anthony Atamanuik, who was promoting \u201cThe President Show,\u201d which will air on Comedy Central after \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d starting Thursday. The \u201cpresident\u201d burst onto Mr. Noah\u2019s set, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t try to be nice.
