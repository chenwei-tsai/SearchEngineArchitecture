University administrators said in a statement that they could not allow Ms. Coulter to speak because of active security threats. In a letter to the Berkeley College Republicans, which was sponsoring the speech, two university vice chancellors said the university had been \u201cunable to find a safe and suitable venue for your planned April 27 event featuring Ann Coulter.\u201d The letter, written by Vice Chancellor Scott Biddy and the vice chancellor for student affairs, Stephen Sutton, said it was \u201cnot possible to assure that the event could be held successfully \u2014 or that the safety of Ms. Coulter, the event sponsors, audience and bystanders could be adequately protected.\u201d After the cancellation was announced on Wednesday, Ms. Coulter posted a Twitter message that \u201cno school accepting public funds can ban free speech.\u201d With its reputation as one of the country\u2019s most liberal universities, the campus and surrounding areas have become a target for small, militant and shadowy right-wing groups who in recent months have clashed with equally militant and shadowy anarchist groups based in the San Francisco Bay Area. On Saturday, at the latest of these violent encounters, the police arrested more than 20 people. One video that went viral on social media showed a man identified as a member of a white supremacist group sucker-punching a woman who identified herself as an anarchist. These fight-club-type episodes, which have occurred both on campus and in the city of Berkeley, have escalated since the election of President Trump. In February, a speech by the incendiary right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos, also sponsored by the campus Republicans, was canceled after masked protesters smashed windows, set fires and pelted the police with rocks. Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university, said the college regretted that it had become a magnet for militant groups. \u201cIt\u2019s become an O.K. Corral of sorts for activists across the political spectrum,\u201d Mr. Mogulof said. The university, he said, was committed to having a diversity of voices on campus and was working with the police to reschedule Ms. Coulter\u2019s appearance. \u201cWe are going to do whatever we can to make that happen at a time and a place when police can provide safety and security,\u201d he said. The episodes have become fodder for conservative critics of the university. In February, after the cancellation of the event with Mr. Yiannopoulos, Mr. Trump made a similar point. He posted on Twitter: \u201cIf U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view \u2014 NO FEDERAL FUNDS?\u201d Both Ms. Coulter and the Young America\u2019s Foundation, which books her college speeches, said they expected the event to proceed as planned. Spencer Brown, a spokesman for the Young America\u2019s Foundation, which promotes conservative ideals, said in an email that Ms. Coulter\u2019s lecture would proceed next week \u201cwhether Berkeley likes it or not.\u201d The Berkeley campus gained national attention in 1964 as the center of a movement to expand political expression, which became known as the Free Speech Movement and which prompted other campus activism across the country.", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
