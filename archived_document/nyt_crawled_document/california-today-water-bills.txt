{"text": "Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Today\u2019s introduction comes from Vindu Goel, a technology writer.  OAKLAND \u2014 During California\u2019s long drought, public officials and utilities urged residents to cut back on water usage and imposed temporary bill surcharges to discourage consumption. Consumers and businesses responded by reducing water consumption an average of 22 percent statewide from June 2015 to January 2017. Now their reward will be higher water rates. Although California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, officially declared an end to the state\u2019s drought emergency last month, local water agencies are planning major rate increases to make up for the fact that they are selling a lot less water than they used to. The East Bay Municipal Utility District, which serves 1.4 million people on the east side of San Francisco Bay, told customers last week that it planned to raise water rates 9.25 percent on July 1 and another 9 percent the next year. The water agency in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, is proposing to raise rates 7 percent per year for the next two years. Call it the paradox of conservation. About 80 percent of the costs of delivering water to urban customers are fixed \u2014 pipes, treatment plants, reservoirs. But water bills are set up to recover most of those costs by charging customers a per-gallon fee, said David Mitchell, who studies water policy at M.Cubed, a public policy consulting firm. So when usage drops sharply, as it did during the drought, rates have to go up. \u201cThe fixed costs have to spread over fewer gallons,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. He predicted that water utilities statewide will be raising rates in the next few years to make up for the revenue shortfalls caused by the drought. For the East Bay Municipal Utility District, revenue is down 12 percent this fiscal year, as a drought surcharge ended and the average user cut back from 250 gallons a day to 200. \u201cWe really do appreciate what our customers have done to conserve. They\u2019ve pulled out their lawns. They take shorter showers,\u201d said Jenesse Miller, an agency spokeswoman. \u201cBut whether we deliver one gallon or 130 million gallons, the infrastructure is the same.\u201d Ms. Miller said that the two rate increases, which will ultimately raise the average bill $9 a month by mid-2018, will largely pay for infrastructure improvements and maintenance. \u201cMany parts of the East Bay have pipes that are 90 or 100 years old,\u201d she said.

[The New York Times] Long before the Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in 1954, Mexican-Americans in California were striking the first legal blows against the practice. In 1931, a dispute erupted over plans to segregate the grammar school in Lemon Grove, near San Diego. At the time, anti-immigrant sentiment was rampant in California, with nonwhites  commonly barred from parks, pools and other places. When Lemon Grove created a separate building for Mexican-American students, their parents called it \u201cLa Caballeriza\u201d \u2014 the stable. They organized a lawsuit and, against all odds, won. Historians recognize the case as the country\u2019s first successful school desegregation case. Years later in largely segregated Orange County, five Mexican-American families opened a federal lawsuit, Mendez v. Westminster School District, that accused the district of discriminating against their children. Again, the court agreed. In 1946, Judge Paul J. McCormick ruled that segregation violated the Constitution by suggesting \u201cinferiority\u201d among the children \u201cwhere none exists.\u201d The decision ultimately inspired the passage of a bill to desegregate California. It was signed by Gov. Earl Warren, who later joined the Supreme Court and presided over the Brown v. Board of Education case that overturned the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine. For uncertain reasons, neither Westminster nor Lemon Grove ever created a memorial to their civil rights legacies. A council member, Sergio Contreras, is trying to change that in Westminster. He\u2019s proposed a \u201cfreedom trail\u201d that would include a monument honoring the Mendez case. In Lemon Grove, the middle school named its auditorium after Roberto Ricardo Alvarez, the 12-year-old lead plaintiff in the desegregation lawsuit. Mr. Alvarez died in 2003 at 84. According to an obituary, he became a millionaire businessman who always wore a cowboy hat in tribute to his Mexican roots. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.
