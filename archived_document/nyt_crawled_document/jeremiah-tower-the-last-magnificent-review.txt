Mr. Tower, an epicure raised as a lonely child amid chilly affluence, attended Harvard around the late 1960s before finding his calling. On camera, he remembers how, when student protesters invited him to \u201cbecome a revolutionary,\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019m too busy cooking.\u201d He adds: \u201cDrink Champagne and eat smoked salmon. That was my revolution.\u201d After college, in 1972, Mr. Tower alighted at Alice Waters\u2019s pioneering Berkeley, Calif., restaurant, Chez Panisse. Together, he and Ms. Waters gave birth to the so-called California Cuisine, based on local ingredients and championed by the likes of James Beard. After a falling-out with Ms. Waters, Mr. Tower founded the restaurant Stars, a magnet for San Francisco\u2019s political and show-business glitterati, and was bestowed a Dewars endorsement deal. But Stars, overextended (it had branches elsewhere in Northern California and overseas), was damaged and ultimately undone by an earthquake in 1989. After years in retreat, Mr. Tower resurfaced in 2014 to resuscitate the ailing Tavern on the Green in Manhattan. Despite his efforts, he was out a year later. Ms. Tenaglia\u2019s camera lends a polished veneer as food authorities like Ruth Reichl, Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck and Martha Stewart attest to Mr. Tower\u2019s gifts, with Anthony Bourdain, one of the film\u2019s producers, especially forceful. Throughout, the solitary Mr. Tower maintains an unflappable refinement, dedicated, a college friend says, to \u201clooking for some utopian possibility of living, because that\u2019s what kept the darkness away.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/movies/jeremiah-tower-the-last-magnificent-review.html", "section": "Movies", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "Lydia Tenaglia\u2019s documentary is a portrait of Mr. Tower, a force behind the California Cuisine movement in the 1970s, among other culinary feats.", "title": "Review: \u2018Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent,\u2019 a Chef\u2019s Tribulations", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T12:37:44-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "item_type": "Article"}
