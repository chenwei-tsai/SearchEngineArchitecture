{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Mark Bradford, one of America\u2019s most acclaimed painters, could not figure out what to put in the grand rotunda. This artist, who is set to represent his country in May at the 2017 Venice Biennale, found an unusual way of working long-distance. In a warehouse in South Los Angeles, not far from where he grew up, he created a full-size model of the Biennale\u2019s United States pavilion, a stately building with echoes of Monticello. Then he spent the last year testing out his ideas in it. \u201cThis a Jeffersonian-type space, something you see in state capitols,\u201d he said, pointing to its central dome. \u201cI wanted it to feel like a ruin, like we went into a governmental building and started shaking the rotunda and the plaster started falling off. Our rage made the plaster fall off the walls.\u201d With a nod to its Palladian architecture, Mr. Bradford often calls his pavilion the White House. As in: \u201cI wanted to bring the White House to me.\u201d Sitting on a crate, his long legs extended, Mr. Bradford, 55, was confronting a pressing concern beyond exhibition plans: How can he represent the United States abroad at a time when \u2014 as a black, gay man and a self-proclaimed \u201cliberal and progressive thinker\u201d \u2014 he no longer feels represented by his own government. The broad social changes in America \u2014 from the police violence that ignited the Black Lives Matter movement to the messages of hate that he feels were unleashed by the November election \u2014 fueled a personal sense of crisis that permeates much of his forthcoming show in Venice, \u201cTomorrow Is Another Day.\u201d He remembered being invited to the Obama White House with other artists two years ago and feeling that \u201cour voices mattered \u2014 fast-forward, and now they\u2019re talking about cutting the N.E.A.,\u201d he said, shaking his head. And, aware of his own status as an international art star with million-dollar sales, he expressed concern for those more vulnerable. \u201cI felt like a lot of the progress we\u2019ve made to be inclusive, to make sure young little trans kids are safe, was gone in the blink of an eye,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking this body of work became very, very emotional for me. I felt I was making it in a house that was burning.\u201d Mr. Bradford\u2019s replica, Doric columns and all, gave him a chance to try to bring something of the Giardini, the Venice park that hosts the national pavilions, to South Los Angeles and vice versa. In the rotunda, he first tried lining the walls with silver paper. Then he installed a colorful \u201cwaterfall\u201d sculpture \u2014 a cascade of paper strips. Finally, nine or 10 versions in, he realized he needed to \u201ckeep it hot, keep it urgent.\u201d He plastered the walls with what looks like a decaying mural: a gritty collage of fragmented images from cellphone ads scavenged from the neighborhood, which target the friends and family of prison inmates. \u201cReceive calls on your cellphone from jail,\u201d they say \u2014 in exchange for what turn out to be predatory rates. He calls the merchant posters \u201cparasitic\u201d for the way they profit from misfortune. And he sees his work as \u201ca reminder: Don\u2019t forget there are people in need.\u201d Judging from the mock pavilion, the Venice show could be his most urgent exhibition to date. Inside, his roughly elegant abstract paintings have erupted into sculpture, and he is pushing the limit of how much personal and political weight an abstract canvas can actually carry. \u201cBuilding the pavilion was great, because I was making this thing that\u2019s all about power into a safe place where I could play, have angst, fall on the ground,\u201d said Mr. Bradford, who, at 6-foot-8, was slouching to make himself more accessible. \u201cIt\u2019s like taking a hairbrush and lip-syncing your favorite song in the mirror when nobody\u2019s looking.\u201d While pavilion funding comes primarily from a State Department grant of up to $250,000, it is not unusual for selected artists to bite the hand that feeds them. Several have questioned the Olympic-sport model of \u201crepresenting\u201d a country, and some have made their Biennale art a platform for challenging such nationalism. In 2011, the artist duo Allora & Calzadilla took on the American military complex by installing an upside-down tank outside the American pavilion, with a treadmill on top used by a runner. (Roberta Smith of The New York Times called it \u201cangry, sophomoric Conceptualism that borders on the tyrannical.\u201d) Mr. Bradford\u2019s exhibition is not as explicitly political but shaped as a loose journey of self-discovery that can be read in mythological or biographical terms or, often, both at once. The mythological references first appear in a poem by Mr. Bradford hanging on the pavilion\u2019s facade, written in the voice of Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire, metalworking and sculpture. He encounters Medusa: \u201cMad as hell/I looked her dead in the eye/And he knew her.\u201d Mr. Bradford drew from one version of the Hephaestus myth, in which the boy breaks his foot when cast out of Olympus for trying to protect his mother from a punishing Zeus. \u201cSomehow that story just rang true,\u201d Mr. Bradford said. \u201cThat\u2019s the story I heard growing up.\u201d His own life has a bit of an Olympian arc. His single mother raised him in a boardinghouse in South Central while building, at odd hours, her business as a hairstylist. After he was bullied for being, he said, \u201ca sissy,\u201d she moved them to Santa Monica \u2014 a more accepting, \u201cBirkenstock-wearing, fruit-juicing\u201d hippie enclave. Later, as a young gay man in his 20s, he wandered and traveled, feeling no reason to plan for a future when he saw so many men with H.I.V. dying. Finally he went back to school, studying art in community college before being accepted into the game-changing California Institute of the Arts. After earning his B.F.A. and M.F.A., he was in his late 30s and working in his mother\u2019s salon when he created his breakthrough paintings: Agnes Martin-inspired abstractions made from the white endpapers used in perming hair. \u201cI liked how they pointed to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could get a whole box of endpapers for 50 cents. I would affix them to bedsheets, because I couldn\u2019t afford canvas.\u201d Soon that would change: The paintings caught the eye of the curator Thelma Golden, scouting at the time for her groundbreaking 2001 \u201cpost-black\u201d survey, \u201cFreestyle,\u201d at the Studio Museum of Harlem, and the collector Eileen Harris Norton, now a close friend and one of the few to see the mock-pavilion in progress. (She called it a \u201cpowerful and complete experience \u2014 I like that Mark is telling a full story.\u201d) His Biennale exhibition starts, and almost stops, with a bulbous red and black sculpture, \u201cSpoiled Foot.\u201d Bulging from the ceiling, it forces visitors to hug the room\u2019s periphery. And its mottled, diseased-looking surface, made from canvas and paper, is as close as this artist has come to ugliness. This blistered skin is no accident. Mr. Bradford, who talks about feeling \u201cpushed out\u201d by his own country these days, says he first felt a profound sense of \u201cexpulsion\u201d when the AIDS crisis hit hard with painful deaths, compounded by government indifference. The second gallery features another sculpture, \u201cMedusa,\u201d made of black paper rolls as thick as fire hoses that have been soaked, wrung and shaped into coils that recall the snakes of Medusa\u2019s hair. Three new paintings, each named for a Siren, hang on the walls. They are his first endpaper paintings in 13 years and his darkest yet, the papers dyed to create a black-on-black palette. \u201cI like the tension between the dark paintings, where everything is underneath, and the Medusa sculpture, this externalized rage,\u201d he said. Christopher Bedford, who proposed Mr. Bradford to the State Department on behalf of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis (he now runs the Baltimore Museum of Art), sees this gallery, with its hair imagery, as an \u201chomage to the black women who were the ballast of Mark\u2019s life in the beauty salons before he could stand on his own two feet.\u201d \u201cBlack is not ever a neutral color, especially in the hands of a black painter,\u201d said Mr. Bedford, who curated the exhibition with Katy Siegel. \u201cTo go that deep into black is a very heavy and loaded action.\u201d The dark tone of the exhibition changes after a passage through the rotunda, leading to new, large-scale paintings that evoke cellular or galactic forms \u2014 and a feeling of expansiveness. He makes these paintings without brushes or any kind of liquid or powdered paint, building up layers of colored paper on canvas and using a tool, like an automobile sander, to expose the various hues buried in the layers. Or, as Mr. Bedford put it, \u201cHe\u2019s using the sander as a paintbrush.\u201d The final gallery can be read as a celebration of the gay black body, featuring his video \u201cNiagara\u201d (2005). It follows a black man in orange shorts walking, with the flamboyant hip action of Marilyn Monroe, on the streets of South Central. The video touches on sexual and economic vulnerability but also exuberance. Perhaps Mr. Bradford, who has borrowed the exhibition\u2019s title from the last line of the Civil War novel \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d is ending on an optimistic note? The rotunda, with its prison references, offers a link to the artist\u2019s new project outside the pavilion walls: He has made a six-year commitment to help fund a prison cooperative in Venice that assists inmates in building job skills. The program, Rio Ter\u00e0 dei Pensieri, helps prisoners run a farmer\u2019s market and manufacture goods like cosmetics to be sold. With his backing, Rio Ter\u00e0 is also opening a store in Venice this month. Closer to home, in Los Angeles, Mr. Bradford\u2019s community work and philanthropy focus on foster youths in Leimert Park, the neighborhood where his mother had her salon Foxy\u00e9 Hair. (She now lives in Atlanta.) Three years ago, he, Ms. Harris Norton and his life partner, Allan DiCastro, a former banker who had also been a neighborhood council leader, formed a nonprofit group, Art+Practice, to help offer services like housing and job preparation to local teenagers in foster care. Mr. Bradford used part of his $500,000 MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant for its start-up costs. The group is now funded mainly through his art sales. While other artists today position their activism as artworks (\u201csocial practice\u201d is the buzzword), Mr. Bradford does not regard Art+Practice as his art project. He plays down his creative role, stressing the importance of working within the existing community fabric, even if it is torn and frayed. \u201cYou have to do a lot of listening for communities in need,\u201d he said. In the process of researching Leimert Park, he learned that 40 percent of the district\u2019s high school students were in foster care. He brought a similar approach to Rio Ter\u00e0. \u201cI had to ask myself when I got this pavilion, what do I want to do with this?\u201d he said. \u201cI knew I did not want to stand on the mountaintop as Mark Bradford but find a way to help build different relationships.\u201d He is hoping they will last long after his large paintings have left the United States pavilion and the summer crowds empty out of the leafy Giardini.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/design/mark-bradford-venice-biennale.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T12:01:46-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T11:55:30-04:00", "abstract": "Mark Bradford\u2019s concern: How can he represent the United States when he no longer feels represented by his government?", "title": "An Artist\u2019s Mythic Rebellion for the Venice Biennale"}
