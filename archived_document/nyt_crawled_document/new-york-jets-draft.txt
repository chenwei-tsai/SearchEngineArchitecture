{"text": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 The Jets twice selected the same position with consecutive picks during the 2017 N.F.L. draft, for reasons that became somewhat clearer by the event\u2019s conclusion. The Jets used their first- and second-round picks on safeties \u2014 Jamal Adams, from Louisiana State, and Marcus Maye, from Florida. With their next two picks, the Jets grabbed wide receivers \u2014 5-foot-11 ArDarius Stewart from Alabama in the third round (No. 79) and 6-foot-2 Chad Hansen from California in the fourth round (No. 141). Those selections appeared to create a glut at those positions. At safety, the additions threw into question the future of Calvin Pryor, a 2014 first-round pick who has failed to live up to expectations. When the Jets added Hansen early on Saturday, it appeared the team might be preparing to trade wide receiver Eric Decker, especially given the emergence of receivers Quincy Enunwa and Robby Anderson last season and the possibility that Jalin Marshall and Devin Smith can mature into regular contributors at the position. But Smith, it turned out, will not be available this season. General Manager Mike Maccagnan announced on Saturday that Smith had torn the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. Maccagnan said he thought that the injury had occurred before the first day of organized team activities this month. In December 2015, Smith tore the same ligament. \u201cNot to say that that necessarily impacted us,\u201d Maccagnan said of the Hansen pick, \u201cbut we also felt going forward Devin unfortunately won\u2019t be able to play this season for us.\u201d While the Jets doubled down on safeties and receivers, one pattern they did not continue was taking a quarterback, a position that is still in flux on the team. The Jets added a quarterback each year from 2013 to 2016. Two quarterbacks from that haul remain on the roster \u2014 Bryce Petty, a fourth-round pick in 2015 who has yet to prove himself a bona fide starter, and Christian Hackenberg, a second-round pick last year who has yet to play a down for the Jets. Josh McCown, who arrived as a free agent last month, is the projected starting quarterback. Maccagnan had plenty of opportunities to add a quarterback in Saturday\u2019s late rounds as he acquired several picks through trades. The Jets entered the draft with seven picks and ended up trading down five times, for nine total picks. They also gained a fifth-rounder in 2018 from the Dallas Cowboys. After Hansen, the Jets used one of their fifth-round picks on Jordan Leggett (No. 150), a tight end from Clemson with excellent hands, and the other on Dylan Donahue (No. 181), a linebacker from West Georgia. Donahue\u2019s father, Mitch Donahue, played in the N.F.L. as a defensive end from 1991 to 1994. In the sixth round, the Jets picked Elijah McGuire, a running back from Louisiana-Lafayette with the 188th overall selection. With their final two picks, they took cornerbacks who will try to fill the hole left by Darrelle Revis\u2019s departure. Jeremy Clark, from Michigan, was taken 197th over all. Seven slots later, the Jets took Derrick Jones from Mississippi with their final pick.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/sports/football/new-york-jets-draft.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T20:23:47-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T20:23:47-04:00", "abstract": "The Jets loaded up in the defensive secondary and at wide receiver, and announced that Devin Smith had torn the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.", "title": "The Jets Double Down on Several Positions, but Pass on a Quarterback"}
