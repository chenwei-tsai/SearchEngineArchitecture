{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 After a year of halts and roadblocks, Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury is showing no signs of slowing down now. His vivacity is often visible. On Thursday night, instead of resting during a television timeout with just over four minutes left in Game 1 of the Penguins\u2019 second-round playoff series against the Washington Capitals, Fleury was bouncing buoyantly, coiling and uncoiling his legs, as springy as ever. The frenetic preparation paid off. A minute later, Fleury flailed into several unorthodox contortions to protect a 3-2 lead as a mad scramble developed around his crease. Having lost his stick, Fleury first became a starfish \u2014 limbs spread across the ice \u2014 to face the Capitals\u2019 first two shots. He then rose into a more standard butterfly as he prepared to face a third and fourth, and then desperately went for an old-school two-pad stack to build a wall against a fifth and sixth attempt before, finally, the whistle blew, ending the onslaught. Three more shots later, the Penguins had survived to take a one-game-to-none lead in a series between the regular season\u2019s two top teams. After the game, Fleury\u2019s smile stretched out widest as he described the win and its frantic final moments. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s been good,\u201d Fleury, 32, said of his playoff success so far, which also included a five-game win over the Columbus Blue Jackets in the first round. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to enjoy every game, one by one, and tried to enjoy the moment. And it\u2019s always more fun when you win.\u201d Fleury\u2019s postseason has been significantly more fun than his last one. Last season, he was knocked out of the lineup by a concussion in late March. He lost his starting job to Matt Murray, 10 years his junior. Murray then led the Penguins to their fourth Stanley Cup, and while Fleury had his name etched onto the trophy for the second time, his future in Pittsburgh appeared shaky. Fleury has factored heavily into speculation about the coming expansion draft  for the Vegas Golden Knights, who enter the league next season. He was also frequently mentioned as a likely mover in the lead-up to the March 1 trade deadline. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out,\u201d Penguins General Manager Jim Rutherford told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in January. \u201cIt becomes more difficult as the season goes along for the coach to keep both guys happy.\u201d The deadline passed without incident, however, and standing pat has proved prudent. Murray suddenly tweaked a lower-body injury during warm-ups for Game 1 against Columbus on April 12. He has not yet resumed skating, but the Penguins have had little reason to fret the loss of their top goaltender. Fleury\u2019s .934 save percentage through six games is the best playoff mark of his career, and far better than his .909 average in the regular season. Penguins Coach Mike Sullivan said he admired how Fleury had handled the \u201cdifficult\u201d goaltending decisions often not made in his favor. \u201cI think Marc deserves so much credit for his professionalism and for his selfless approach,\u201d Sullivan said hours before Thursday\u2019s game. \u201cHe\u2019s a true teammate, and he puts the team ahead of himself in a lot of ways. We couldn\u2019t be happier for how well he\u2019s playing for us now, and the difference that he\u2019s made in helping this team continue to win games.\u201d After the Game 1 victory, defenseman Ian Cole was equally effusive about how Fleury has soared after coming off the bench. \u201cHe\u2019s a world-class goaltender \u2014 he\u2019s shown that for so many years now,\u201d Cole said. \u201cHis ability to step up when the stakes are at their highest, it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s so clutch. We\u2019re very proud of him \u2014 maybe that\u2019s the way to describe it. We\u2019re very excited. Enough can\u2019t be said for how professional and how good of a goaltender he is.\u201d Murray had been the Penguins\u2019 goalie in their six-game series victory over the Capitals in the second round of last year\u2019s playoffs. Several Capitals players have said there was little difference between facing Murray or facing Fleury, who had his own triumph over Washington in the 2009 playoffs. \u201cHe\u2019s just obviously a great goaltender, and a veteran guy who knows how to battle,\u201d Capitals forward Jay Beagle said of Fleury. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bit smaller than Murray, so there\u2019s that in the differences, but other than that a goalie is a goalie. You\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019re getting pucks on him and taking his eyes away and making it hard on him. He made some incredible saves last night, and we\u2019ve just got to keep pounding the rock at him.\u201d Although Fleury was the Penguins\u2019 starter in their Stanley Cup run in 2009, postseason reliability has not been his strength. The first overall pick in the 2003 N.H.L. draft, Fleury has frequently been a scapegoat for Pittsburgh\u2019s disappointing early eliminations, most notably a six-game loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in 2012 in which he posted a woeful .834 save percentage and 4.63 goals against average. Fleury said his past struggles and setbacks had made him appreciate these recent successes more. \u201cMaybe a little bit, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s waiting for you in the afterworld. I\u2019m fortunate to be playing on a good team. And winning some games, it\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/hockey/nhl-playoffs-penguins-capitals-fleury.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T20:08:44-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T20:08:44-04:00", "abstract": "With the starting goalie Matt Murray injured, Fleury is excelling, including a Game 1 victory against the Capitals in which he made several late saves.", "title": "This Postseason, Penguins\u2019 Marc-Andre Fleury Is Having Success, and Fun"}
