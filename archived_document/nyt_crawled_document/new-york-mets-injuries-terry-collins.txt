{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Three hours before Friday\u2019s game here, Noah Syndergaard strolled out to the outfield at Nationals Park to play catch. He needed to test out the balky right biceps and shoulder that had forced the Mets, out of caution, to scratch him hours before Thursday\u2019s start. If things went well, Mets Manager Terry Collins said, the team would probably pencil Syndergaard in for Sunday\u2019s start against Washington. \u201cHe thought he could pitch yesterday,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t going to pitch him after the two days previous that he had the aching in his arm.\u201d If Syndergaard cannot pitch on Sunday, Collins said, the Mets would turn to Sean Gilmartin, who was called up on Friday after outfielder Yoenis Cespedes landed on the disabled list earlier in the day with a strained left hamstring. This is the everyday juggling act the Mets now face without their most talented hitter (Cespedes) and pitcher (Syndergaard) not ready to play. And then there all the other players on the disabled list \u2014 David Wright, Lucas Duda, Wilmer Flores, Brandon Nimmo, Seth Lugo and Steven Matz. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the job,\u201d Collins said, adding, \u201cI understand you have injuries, but to have so many early, it\u2019s been a little frustrating.\u201d Cespedes hurt his hamstring when running out a double in Thursday\u2019s game and needed help walking off the field. Collins said Cespedes\u2019s magnetic resonance imaging examination had not revealed anything beyond the expected strain. \u201cThey really didn\u2019t see a lot,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably better news than we thought. It\u2019s still going to be a while, obviously. In Cespedes\u2019s absence, the Mets moved Jay Bruce back to the outfield; he previously filled in at first base while Duda has been out with a hyperextended left elbow. Duda could return soon \u2014 he was expected to begin his minor league rehabilitation assignment with Class A St. Lucie on Friday. Collins said the utility man T. J. Rivera would get a crack at first base until Duda\u2019s return. Flores, a key utility man who has been out for more than a week with a right knee infection, is slowly building his strength back up before beginning his own minor league rehabilitation assignment. As Collins went through his now normal pregame routine of talking about injuries, he also provided a clearer timeline of Thursday\u2019s events. After the Mets decided to scratch Syndergaard, they asked Matt Harvey just three hours before the day\u2019s game if he could start, and he agreed. After Tuesday\u2019s rainout, Harvey\u2019s regularly scheduled start had been pushed back to Friday. But on Thursday, for the second straight start, the Mets instead asked Harvey to work on short notice. Harvey struggled filling in for Syndergaard and said after the game that he had not been physically prepared to start, citing the fact that he had done a heavy workout on Wednesday thinking he would not pitch until Friday. As a result, as Thursday\u2019s game progressed, his body tightened up. Collins said on Friday that he had not known about that workout until Harvey mentioned it after the game. It was on Wednesday night, Collins said, that the Mets were still weighing who would start the next day. On Thursday morning, they decided it would not be Syndergaard, as it seemed like too big a risk. That left Harvey. Asked if the Mets were concerned that they had put Harvey in a difficult spot on Thursday, given that he had season-ending surgery just a year ago, Collins said, \u201cThis is not a perfect world we live in, so you\u2019ve got to make adjustments.\u201d Harvey at least pitched on five days of rest on Thursday, and he saved the team from having to overtax its bullpen and make more roster moves as a result. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he would\u2019ve had a heavy workout,\u201d Collins said of Harvey\u2019s Wednesday routine. \u201cHe might\u2019ve. I don\u2019t know what their preday routines are, but I applaud him for taking the baseball.\u201d The Mets knew they would be facing more hurdles when they showed up to the stadium on Friday to begin a key early season series against the Nationals. The Mets entered the day as losers of six straight games, including a three-game sweep at the hands of the Nationals last week. With an 8-13 record, the Mets sit in last place in the National League East, while the Nationals have the best record in baseball at 16-6. So with a weakened roster, the Mets were preparing to face the 2016 National League Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer and the equally formidable Stephen Strasburg in the series\u2019 first two games. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start playing better,\u201d Collins said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Nats, and good pitching, and it\u2019s the major leagues. We\u2019ve got to go out and start scoring some runs. It\u2019s something we haven\u2019t done in a while.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/new-york-mets-injuries-terry-collins.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T21:09:34-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T21:09:34-04:00", "abstract": "The latest in a long line of setbacks came on Friday, when Yoenis Cespedes landed on the disabled list with a strained hamstring. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little frustrating,\u201d Collins said.", "title": "With All the Injuries, Mets Manager Terry Collins Is Doubling as a Juggler"}
