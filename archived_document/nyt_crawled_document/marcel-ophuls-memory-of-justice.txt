{"text": "Marcel Ophuls says that \u201cThe Memory of Justice\u201d is his best movie. This catches your attention, given that another movie he directed, \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity,\u201d might be the best documentary ever made. \u201cI think it\u2019s the most personal and sincere work I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he said recently about \u201cThe Memory of Justice,\u201d a four-and-a-half-hour examination of war crimes and guilt from 1976 that focused on the Nuremberg trials and the Vietnam War. \u201cAnd it disappeared.\u201d The film\u2019s history is a drama in itself, part thriller, part tragedy. It involves an American Army base, the late-night pilfering of film canisters, a screening that left Mike Nichols in tears and a fatal review. The long final act ends in redemption at the hands of Martin Scorsese (among others) and includes the film\u2019s long-delayed television premiere, on HBO2 on Monday, April 24. This is the story according to the 89-year-old Mr. Ophuls, anyway, and he tells it \u2014 by phone recently from his home in Southern France \u2014 very convincingly, with frequent bouts of wheezing laughter. The son of Max Ophuls, the great German director of romantic melodramas (\u201cLa Ronde\u201d), Mr. Ophuls tried fiction filmmaking with mixed results and moved into nonfiction to find work. \u201cIt all has to do with groceries,\u201d he said. \u201cNot so much with cinema.\u201d The need to put groceries on the table eventually resulted in \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity,\u201d the hugely influential 1971 film about collaboration in Vichy France. A few years later Mr. Ophuls learned that 50 hours of raw footage of the Nuremberg trials, shot by the United States Army Signal Corps, were stored at a Maryland base. He gained access and started viewing the reels, which had to be hand-rolled. Every so often he broke the film, irritating his Army minders. The documentary he made using that footage was wide-ranging and open-ended, not just a history of the trials, though it incorporated that. Tackling the questions of national and individual culpability and guilt, Mr. Ophuls interviewed American conscientious objectors and whistle-blowers (like Daniel Ellsberg), French veterans of Algeria and many Germans, from surviving Nuremberg defendants like Albert Speer to college students born after the war. He also put himself in the movie. With his family, and again with his film students at Princeton, he discussed the documentary\u2019s themes and posed questions to his wife, the daughter of a German veteran. Not all of the producers, a mix of British and German backers, were happy with the results. There were complaints about the film\u2019s length and some brief nudity, Mr. Ophuls said, and requests that more focus be put on Russian actions during World War II and American actions in Vietnam. With the editing nearly complete, an acrimonious meeting at the Ritz bar in London resulted \u2014 depending on whose account you believe \u2014 in Mr. Ophuls either being fired (his version) or walking away. Barred from his own project, he retreated to Princeton. But then the plot turned. Two women who had worked on the film with him hid in the restroom of the London editing suite and sneaked away with a black-and-white work print of his original edit. It made its way to New York, where supporters \u2014 including Hamilton Fish, the future publisher and social activist, then a recent Harvard graduate \u2014 screened it for other filmmakers and critics, including Frank Rich and David Denby. Mr. Denby wrote an article about the situation in 1975 for The New York Times. Mr. Nichols sat motionless for eight hours (with reel changes) and then said to Mr. Fish, \u2018So what can I do?\u2019\u201d With endorsements like that, and the financial backing of Paramount, Mr. Fish was able to negotiate Mr. Ophuls\u2019s return and to see that the film was completed the way its director wished. \u201cAn injury had been done to something of great cultural and historical significance,\u201d Mr. Fish said in a recent interview. But it had been healed. \u201cThe Memory of Justice\u201d played at the 1976 Cannes and New York film festivals and received good reviews, including raves from Mr. Rich in The New York Post and Vincent Canby in The Times. But Pauline Kael, a champion of \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity\u201d and the most influential film critic of the time, panned the documentary in The New Yorker. \u201cStriving for complexity,\u201d she wrote, \u201cOphuls extended his inquiry in so many directions he lost his subject.\u201d \u201cWho else could get the people to see a five-hour documentary?\u201d Mr. Ophuls said. \u201cIt folded after six or seven weeks and hasn\u2019t been heard since.\u201d Mr. Fish, as a producer, saw things differently \u2014 he said that for a film of its type, in the days before specialty distributors had taken off, the commercial release was successful, and he discounted the influence of Kael\u2019s review. But he agreed that \u201cThe Memory of Justice\u201d faded out of sight after 1976. \u201cIt just was too difficult to keep in play,\u201d he said. But Mr. Fish never stopped trying. He got grants, including several from Steven Spielberg, to finance efforts over the years to reintroduce the film. Finally he connected with The Film Foundation, the preservation organization whose founders include Mr. Scorsese. It spearheaded a 10-year restoration process that has brought \u201cThe Memory of Justice\u201d back from the dead once more. \u201cTragically enough, both of the epic 20th-century subjects tackled definitively by Ophuls, Vichy and Nuremberg, remain as pertinent, if not more pertinent, than ever,\u201d said Mr. Rich, a former New York Times columnist who is now a creative consultant at HBO. \u201cThe restoration could not be more aptly timed, and I imagine it will come as a revelation to viewers not yet born during its first meager release.\u201d If enough people see \u201cThe Memory of Justice\u201d this time, it might mean that Mr. Ophuls will no longer be known in America largely through Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d in which Alvy and Annie stand in line to see \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity.\u201d But if not, Mr. Ophuls won\u2019t be too concerned. \u201cOh, I love it,\u201d he said of his indirect contribution to \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s terrifically funny. I know it more or less by heart.\u201d And then he recited several lines of dialogue involving \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity,\u201d correct down to the reference to a Bloomingdale\u2019s charge card. \u201cI got a letter from Woody Allen thanking me and saying that he would treat the film with great respect etc. etc., which I really didn\u2019t ask for,\u201d Mr. Ophuls recalled. \u201cWho cares if the film is treated with respect? Why should it be?\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/movies/marcel-ophuls-memory-of-justice.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T12:19:10-04:00", "abstract": "The monumental documentary about war and guilt is making its television premiere on HBO2.", "title": "Marcel Ophuls\u2019s \u2018Memory of Justice,\u2019 No Longer Just a Memory", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Movies", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T12:19:57-04:00"}
