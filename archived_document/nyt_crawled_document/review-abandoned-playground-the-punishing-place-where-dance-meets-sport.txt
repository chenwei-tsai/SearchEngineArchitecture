At the beginning of Abby Zbikowski\u2019s exhilarating \u201cAbandoned Playground,\u201d which had its world premiere at Abrons Arts Center on Thursday, it\u2019s not entirely clear. Nine dancers in uniforms of orange shorts, sneakers and heavy-duty kneepads \u2014 members of Ms. Zbikowski\u2019s five-year-old company, Abby Z and the New Utility \u2014 warmed up on the stage of the Abrons playhouse with the focused energy of boxers preparing for a fight. What followed over the next hour was a fight of sorts, not against one another so much as themselves. \u201cAbandoned Playground\u201d pits these dancer-athletes against the limits of their own strength and endurance, and they triumph. The audience, seated onstage, surrounds the performers on four sides, heightening the tension. \u201cDoing it gets us all through it,\u201d Ms. Zbikowski wrote in the program notes, and as you watch this passionate, punishing piece, you start to see what she means. To rest would be to lose precious momentum. The challenge lies in the ferociously physical steps \u2014 an onslaught of thwacking arms, emphatic kicks, dizzying spins, swift somersaults, perilous balances and slippery contortions \u2014 and their relentless repetition. In pairs or trios or alone, eventually merging into one group, the resilient dancers enter the space and rip into these tasks. They make their own music with skidding and stomping feet, though the composer Raphael Xavier offers the occasional blast of electronic sound. As those in the center sweat and grunt, others cheer them on with shouts of \u201cPush!\u201d and \u201cYou got this!\u201d One woman rises into a headstand and falls backward in one piece, a plank hitting the floor. Another bounces in a kneeling position, her torso bent over her thighs and arms by her sides, improbably inching forward. Ms. Zbikowski, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has a background in hip-hop, tap and West African dance styles \u2014 she trained at the Senegalese dancer Germaine Acogny\u2019s school \u2014 and those forms infuse \u201cAbandoned Playground,\u201d with its gutsiness and serious regard for rhythm. It also brings to mind the choreographer Elizabeth Streb\u2019s brand of \u201cextreme action.\u201d Yet while Ms. Streb often relies on complex contraptions to test the laws of physics, Ms. Zbikowski uses nothing but the body and the floor. At times, the work\u2019s strenuousness seems absurd, or aimless. What is it all for? Yet those moments are fleeting, and ultimately, the effort justifies itself.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/arts/dance/review-abandoned-playground-the-punishing-place-where-dance-meets-sport.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T15:35:58-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Review: \u2018Abandoned Playground,\u2019 the Punishing Place Where Dance Meets Sport", "created_date": "2017-04-18T15:35:58-04:00", "section": "Arts"}
