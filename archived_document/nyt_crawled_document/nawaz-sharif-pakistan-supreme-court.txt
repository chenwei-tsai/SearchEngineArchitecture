The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the accusations, which stemmed from the Panama Papers that were leaked last year, had been highly anticipated, and it was a bitter disappointment to opposition parties, which had counted on the court to remove Mr. Sharif. Pakistan\u2019s most prominent opposition politician, Imran Khan, had said before the ruling that it would be a \u201cdefining moment in the country\u2019s history.\u201d Last April, the Panama Papers revealed that three of Mr. Sharif\u2019s children controlled shell companies through which they owned expensive residential properties in London. The revelations set off political turmoil, as opposition parties accused Mr. Sharif of financial wrongdoing and money laundering, which he and his family denied. In November, the Supreme Court began hearing a series of petitions against Mr. Sharif based on the accusations. On Thursday, in a courtroom overflowing with government ministers, opposition politicians and lawyers, Justice Asif Saeed Khosa said a team consisting of civilian and military intelligence investigators would investigate Mr. Sharif\u2019s finances and report its findings within 60 days. The five-member panel led by Mr. Khosa voted 3-2 that there was insufficient evidence to remove Mr. Sharif from office. Mr. Khan, leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, left the courtroom in the capital, Islamabad, soon after the ruling was announced, and he later demanded that Mr. Sharif step down while the investigation proceeded. \u201cWhat moral authority does Nawaz Sharif have to stay prime minister?\u201d he said at a news conference at his residence. Last fall, Mr. Khan had threatened to shut down Islamabad with street protests demanding the prime minister\u2019s resignation, but he called off the demonstrations after the Supreme Court said it would address the issue. Members of Mr. Sharif\u2019s governing party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, were jubilant on Thursday, with supporters handing out candy at the doorsteps of the courthouse.  There was no immediate statement from Mr. Sharif, but his daughter and presumed political heir, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, posted pictures on Twitter of her smiling father embracing and celebrating with relatives and party leaders. Salman Akram Raja, a lawyer for Mr. Sharif\u2019s family, said the ruling was vindication for the government, which had said that it supported an independent investigation of the allegations. \u201cWe had said right from the onset that the Supreme Court cannot investigate the allegations,\u201d Mr. Raja said. \u201cIt should devise a mechanism for an investigation into the allegations, and today\u2019s verdict formulates that mechanism.\u201d Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, a lawmaker with the governing party, said its members would not hesitate to appear before the investigators. \u201cWe will also be victorious once the investigation is completed,\u201d he said. Opposition figures echoed Mr. Khan\u2019s call for the prime minister to step aside while the investigation was carried out. Ikram Chaudhry, a senior opposition lawyer, said it was doubtful that an impartial investigation could be conducted with Mr. Sharif still in power. \u201cWe thought that for the time being, Mr. Sharif should have been asked to step aside,\u201d he said. \u201cI think from that perspective this decision will not help in curbing corruption and corrupt practices in the country.\u201d Mr. Raja said there was no reason for Mr. Sharif to step aside, and he noted that the court had not said that the prime minister should do so. Analysts said the ruling took some political pressure off Mr. Sharif, who has spent most of his term fending off the political onslaught from Mr. Khan, as well as pressure from the country\u2019s powerful military. In 2014, Mr. Khan led thousands of his supporters to the capital and staged a sit-in outside Parliament for months, accusing Mr. Sharif of rigging the previous general election. Since April of last year, Mr. Khan has made the Panama Papers revelations the centerpiece of his campaign against the prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best possible outcome for the government, but it comes quite close,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, deputy director for Asia and senior associate for South Asia at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center. \u201cThe prime minister wasn\u2019t disqualified, and the verdict calls for an investigation that the government had already agreed to support.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line is that Sharif isn\u2019t off the hook, but he\u2019s also not heading out the door, and ultimately that\u2019s a big victory for the government,\u201d he added. Even taking the investigation into account, he said, the verdict leaves Mr. Sharif in a relatively strong position for elections next year, \u201cbarring any unforeseen circumstances.\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
