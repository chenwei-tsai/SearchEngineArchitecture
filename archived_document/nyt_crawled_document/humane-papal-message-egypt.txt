{"text": "It is hardly surprising that Pope Francis would draw criticism on a visit to a dictatorship where Islam is the dominant religion. That comes with the job. Catholic conservatives have misgivings about his embrace of Muslims \u2014 especially in a country, Egypt, where radical Islamists have murdered Christians. Secular liberals are wary of a visit that could be interpreted as support for an authoritarian leader. And every word from the leader of so powerful a church is bound to be parsed, as was his ill-advised comparison of refugee camps to concentration camps. But papal visits are not diplomatic missions, even though a lot of diplomacy is inevitably involved. They are, as Francis explained to reporters on the flight back to Rome, about values. And though Catholics may differ on whether the pope has gone too far in his social message or not far enough on issues like abortion and sexual abuse by priests, it is hard to deny that what Francis said and did in Egypt are worth heeding. He was there, of course, to express solidarity with the victims of two terror attacks on Coptic churches on April 9, Palm Sunday. Bombs for which the Islamic State took responsibility exploded in a city north of Cairo and in the main cathedral in Alexandria, killing at least 45 people. Francis condemned any invocation of religion to justify such crimes, yet once again he rejected the notion that Islam and violence are intimately intertwined, most notably in a meeting with Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the grand imam of a mosque associated with Islamic scholarship. The only fanaticism that religious believers should have, he declared, \u201cis that of charity.\u201d And when he met with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who stands accused of serious human rights violations, Francis declared that \u201chistory does not forgive those who preach justice but then practice injustice.\u201d That may look like a political balancing act, but it is also a consistent human and common-sense approach that has marked Francis\u2019s papacy from the start. However one rates the pope\u2019s visit to Egypt and whatever one thinks the proper role of a religious leader should be, the pontiff\u2019s message of faith, humility, peace, tolerance, dialogue and tenderness \u2014 that last a quality he urged on political leaders in a recent TED talk \u2014 is a reassuring departure from the cynicism, cruelty, populism and tribalism on the rise in so many corners of the world, especially in traditional bastions of democracy and freedom.", "source": "International New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/opinion/humane-papal-message-egypt.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T09:18:25-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "created_date": "2017-05-02T09:18:25-04:00", "abstract": "The pope\u2019s speech, after two attacks on Coptic churches, was consistent with the common-sense approach he has always taken.", "title": "A Humane Papal Message in Egypt"}
