{"text": "FRIDAY PUZZLE \u2014 David Steinberg starts off our solving weekend, and he tells you all about the puzzle in his notes below. But for my money, this puzzle was made by the entry WHAT A DUMP. I\u2019m a movie buff, so it thrilled me to see it there, after only a single usage in 1999. The line, first uttered by Bette Davis in the 1949 film, \u201cBeyond the Forest,\u201d was parodied brilliantly by Elizabeth Taylor in the 1966 film, \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d The scene where she harangues her poor husband George about who said the line is riveting, and it is a tribute to the internet that the only thing I could think of when I rewatched the scene was that their marriage could have been saved if only Google had existed back then. Other highlights include the debuts of SEXY AND I KNOW IT and LEMON LIME. \u25a0 22A: Not Ringo or his given name, Richard. We only have three squares for the entry, so the answer to \u201cDrummer Starkey\u201d has to be his son ZAK, who is currently touring with The Who. \u25a0 32A: ENTR\u2019 is the \u201cstart\u201d of a break in a play (as in \u201centr\u2019acte\u201d), and therefore an intermission of sorts. Sometimes music is played during the break. \u25a0 5D: \u201cBug exterminator?\u201d is another example of wordplay. It\u2019s not a person spraying for vermin that we\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s a CODER, who will hopefully fix any bugs in his or her computer code. \u25a0 10D: Think carefully: Are we supposed to be thinking about the literal bottom of the sea, or are we supposed to be thinking about a bottom that is in the sea? Today it\u2019s the latter, and the bottom would be the HULL of a ship. \u25a0 51-/52D: I was itching to put in INFO- for \u201cPrefix with -graphic\u201d for either of the answers and I would have been wrong for both. That\u2019s Friday for you. Today, the answers are XERO- and DEMO-. Starting Monday, Wordplay will offer a new feature: The answer key to the daily puzzle will appear on the column. It will be hidden behind a link, so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t want spoilers; you don\u2019t have to click on it. If you\u2019re struggling, though, we\u2019d like you to have an easy way to access the daily answers.
