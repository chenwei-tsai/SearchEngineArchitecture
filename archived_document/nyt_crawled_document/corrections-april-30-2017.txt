{"text": "ARTS & LEISURE An article last Sunday about films inspired by President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall with Mexico referred incorrectly to the filmmaker Ale Damiani.

It is \u201cWe slept in what had once been the gymnasium\u201d \u2014 not \u201cA chair, a table, a lamp.\u201d (That is the first sentence of the second chapter.) REAL ESTATE The Living In column last Sunday, about Fort George in Manhattan, misstated the location of Fort Tryon Park. It is in nearby Hudson Heights, not Fort George. \u2022 A listing on the \u201cOn the Market\u201d page last Sunday misstated the asking price for a loft in the financial district. It is listed at $1,950,000, not $2,176,000. SUNDAY BUSINESS An article last Sunday about how commercial flight crews are taught to defuse situations referred incorrectly to an entity that uses the letters LUV to identify itself. Southwest Airlines uses LUV as its stock symbol; it is not the official airline code of Love Field in Dallas, which is DAL.

She was the first female African-American to be named a principal dancer at the American Ballet Theater, not the first African-American ever. (Desmond Richardson, who joined the company in 1997, holds that distinction. \u2022 An article last Sunday about the decline of cash referred incorrectly to the number of European Union members that retain national currencies. There are nine, not one. \u2022 A report last Sunday about the wedding of Luke Norris and Justin Lo misspelled the middle name of Mr. Norris\u2019s mother. She is Paula Pennella Norris, not Penella.
