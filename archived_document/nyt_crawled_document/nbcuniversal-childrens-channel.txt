{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 In a new salvo in the children\u2019s television wars, NBCUniversal is creating its own Disney Channel. Starting on Sept. 9, NBCUniversal will turn one of its smallest cable properties, Sprout, into a network called Universal Kids, said Deirdre Brennan, who will oversee the effort. She said NBCUniversal wanted to create an \u201cumbrella brand\u201d for its family offerings \u2014 television cartoons made by the Universal-owned DreamWorks Animation, Universal-Illumination films and attractions at Universal theme parks. Sprout is solely aimed at preschool viewers, but Universal Kids will concentrate on children 2 through 11. The revamped channel\u2019s first series will be \u201cTop Chef Junior,\u201d a spinoff of the cooking show on NBCUniversal\u2019s Bravo. \u201cReality programming is a real white space in the U.S. children\u2019s market \u2014 food, pets, dancing, even news,\u201d said Ms. Brennan, who will be general manager of Universal Kids. \u201cLook at how sophisticated 11-year-olds are these days. They want more than the same sitcoms.\u201d At its start, Universal Kids will also show reruns of DreamWorks Animation cartoons like \u201cAll Hail King Julien,\u201d which is connected to the \u201cMadagascar\u201d movie franchise. NBCUniversal bought DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion last year, an acquisition that hinged in large part on the boutique studio\u2019s television cartoon business. \u201cWe\u2019re connecting our businesses in a way that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Bonnie Hammer, chairwoman of NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment, said in an email. Ms. Hammer added that the goal was to create \u201can even richer entertainment experience and a new strategic business model.\u201d Continuing as it is now would have been perilous for Sprout, which has low ratings and reaches only about 59 million homes in the United States. (Nickelodeon, in comparison, is in more than 90 million.) As more consumers look for slimmed-down cable packages or forgo a cable connection entirely, bottom-rung channels are not expected to survive. Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, may see a robust children\u2019s television business as important to its goals with its Xfinity TV service, which includes a Netflix-style streaming component. Cartoons \u2014 many supplied by DreamWorks Animation \u2014 have been crucial to Netflix\u2019s emergence as an entertainment home base for families. (DreamWorks Animation will continue to make cartoons for Netflix.) Universal Kids may also be aimed at taking advantage of marketplace tumult: Ratings have recently tumbled for some children\u2019s television stalwarts. Viacom\u2019s Nickelodeon held steady among viewers 2 through 11 in the first quarter compared with the same period a year ago, but Time Warner\u2019s Cartoon Network fell 15 percent, according to Todd Juenger, a media analyst at Sanford Bernstein. Disney Channel, which does not accept traditional advertising (and focuses on children as old as 14), declined 20 percent, while the ad-supported Disney XD plunged 27 percent. There is no guarantee that Universal Kids will fare any better. One cautionary example: After pouring resources into a children\u2019s channel called The Hub in 2010, Discovery Communications and Hasbro retrenched in 2014. But analysts say there is too much potential value on the table not to try. Each year, children\u2019s TV generates billions of dollars in ad revenue, subscriber fees and toy sales for Disney, Time Warner and Viacom.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/business/media/nbcuniversal-childrens-channel.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T17:52:12-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T17:52:12-04:00", "abstract": "A small cable property, Sprout, will soon become Universal Kids.
