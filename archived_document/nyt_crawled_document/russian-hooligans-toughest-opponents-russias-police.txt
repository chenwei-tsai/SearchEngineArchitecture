{"text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Holding on to the ankles of two of his opponents, Alex, a 33-year-old member of a Moscow soccer hooligan group, felt the blows on his head but wouldn\u2019t let go. The third man on top of him was battering his skull with both fists, but still Alex held on, hoping to buy his teammates, battling around him, breathing space. At last, the man rammed his elbow down into Alex\u2019s face, shattering his eye socket. He let go. This was not his first fight; years of organized brawls have left Alex with a face reshaped by blows. (Surgery and a plastic implant stabilized his eye after this most recent one.) And that last fight, nearly a year ago, had been a good one, Alex said in a recent interview. His side had won. What had unnerved him was a new feeling: He realized it was getting harder to keep up. When it first appeared in the 1990s, hooliganism in Russian soccer modeled itself heavily on the English version, adopting its clothes and terminology, including the term for its groups: firms. The Russians also embraced the English\u2019s passion for blackout drinking and drunken brawling. \u201cThe English were our school,\u201d said Yevgeny Malinkin, a fan in his 40s known as Kril. \u201cNow we\u2019ve lost our fathers. We\u2019ve overtaken them.\u201d In fact, Russia\u2019s hooligan scene has undergone a transformation. The new generation bears little resemblance to the beery bravado and off-balance punch-ups associated with traditional European hooliganism, or even the sometimes militialike violence of South American ultras. Instead, the fans who have emerged in Russia over the past decade are obsessed with physical fitness, elite martial arts training and \u2014 at least while fighting \u2014 militant sobriety. Christened Okolofutbola, or \u201caround football,\u201d Russia\u2019s hooligan scene has developed into perhaps Europe\u2019s toughest, and just over a year before their country hosts soccer\u2019s World Cup, the most hard-core Russian fans may be in the best fighting shape of their lives. But while their prowess is not in doubt, fan monitors, soccer officials and even the hooligans themselves say there is virtually no chance the disorder that the Russian fans brought to last year\u2019s European Championship in France will be repeated on home soil. Instead, Russia\u2019s hooligan groups are enduring an unprecedented crackdown by the authorities, who are determined that the World Cup will go smoothly. Interviews with more than a dozen fans and hooligan group members over the past five months have shed light on a wave of arrests and searches that have targeted the most violent fans and their leaders, as the police have turned measures more associated with antiterrorism operations and political repression against the hooligans. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d said Andrei Malosolov, a soccer journalist who helped found Russia\u2019s national supporters club, \u201cthe years before the 2018 World Cup will be the quietest in the history of Russian soccer.\u201d In Marseille in June, it quickly became clear the Russians had come to fight. Thousands of English fans had packed the Old Port of the southern French city ahead of their team\u2019s match against Russia at the European Championship. The English \u2014 many of whom had been drinking for three days \u2014 had occupied the waterfront\u2019s cafes, from where some occasionally lobbed objects toward French riot police officers standing watch. The Russians, meanwhile, had landed in Barcelona, Spain. There they boarded buses for France, identifying one another by singing Russian punk songs. Arriving in Marseille, they received text messages with instructions on where to gather. Without even stopping to drop their luggage, most headed straight for the English. \u201cWe literally hadn\u2019t managed to get to the end of the first beer before a clap rang out and our guys shouted, \u2018So, what are we doing this?\u2019\u201d Ivan, a wiry fan who traveled with a dozen others to France, recalled in a Moscow bar recently. \u201cWe went into that square and started to just really, just to work in all 360 degrees.\u201d (Ivan, like many of those interviewed who still take part in organized fights, declined to be quoted using his full name, for fear of a visit from the police.) The Russians hit the English like a cavalry charge. In minutes, the port was a battlefield, with fans clashing under barrages of flying bottles and pinwheeling chairs. About 200 Russian fans, many wearing masks and mixed-martial-arts fighting gloves, loped through the chaos, capturing their actions on  GoPro cameras strapped to their bodies. The violence continued in the stadium that night, when hundreds of English fans and neutrals were forced to scramble away from another Russian charge. The chaos left 35 people injured. While the English also had clashed with the police, resulting in a half-dozen arrests, most observers were transfixed by the Russians\u2019 more efficient violence. The Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, described the Russians in almost military terms, telling reporters that they were \u201cwell trained\u201d and \u201cready for hyper-rapid, hyperviolent operations.\u201d The French police expelled 50 Russians \u2014 at least one fan leader sneaked back into the country and had to be deported a second time \u2014 and European soccer\u2019s governing body, UEFA, fined Russia\u2019s federation $170,000 and issued a suspended threat of disqualification for its team. Hanging over the entire episode, though, was a frightening new question: Would visiting fans risk attack from crack squads of hypertrained hooligans at next year\u2019s World Cup? That some state news media outlets and government officials in Russia appeared to encourage, or at least condone, the violence sowed further doubt. \u201cThe Russian fans are different,\u201d said Antoine Boutonnet, the head of the French police\u2019s national hooligan division. \u201cIt\u2019s almost paramilitary.\u201d \u201cI see the new generation, and I\u2019m really surprised,\u201d said Elena Bykova, a producer who made a film with an-all hooligan cast. \u201cThey don\u2019t like drugs, alcohol. They\u2019re all in the gym.\u201d The fans\u2019 evolution tracks larger movements in Russian society. A trend toward martial arts and fitness generally \u2014 partly promoted by the Kremlin and President Vladimir V. Putin, a trained judoka who is proud of his sporting image \u2014 has spread to fan circles. At the same time, Russia\u2019s security state has reasserted itself, driving hooligan violence underground. While crowd trouble still occurs regularly at Russian league matches, at least a decade ago the authorities\u2019 aggressive policing and closed-circuit cameras largely forced the most dedicated elements of Russian hooliganism to go, as the fans say, \u201cinto the woods.\u201d They mean it literally. The bulk of Russian hooligan fights now take place in remote woods, where on weekends groups of young men from rival clubs form into two opposing lines in forest clearings. Then they attack each other. The bouts are savage. Top fighters measure them in seconds, with opponents usually incapacitated in less than a minute. Five minutes is a marathon. The rules are few: no weapons, and stop when commanded by a referee. That\u2019s about it. Some courtesies are observed: Stamping on heads is frowned upon, though not barred. The fights are used as proving grounds. Recruits to various firms are invited to trial bouts, starting with seven-on-seven affairs, and then graduating to 15 a side, or 20. Elite fights can involve 80-on-80 brawls, and serious injuries are common: concussions, broken legs, cracked jaws, fractured skulls. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t yelled, \u2018Stop,\u2019 you can continue,\u201d said Alex, a member of RB Warriors, a well-known group that supports CSKA Moscow. \u201cYou need to beat them so that a person won\u2019t stand up again. Because if they stand up, it means they can attack you from behind. But I never in my life will jump on someone\u2019s head. Only those who are not strong do that.\u201d The opportunity to measure themselves in such unrestrained tests of strength attracted those already practicing combat sports, particularly the forms of Thai boxing and other mixed martial arts now popular in Russia. An arms race among hooligan firms for the best fighters drove up the level. With the quality of fighters at a peak, drinking before a brawl is ill advised, but the pastime surged in popularity after Ms. Bykova\u2019s 2013 film, \u201cOkolofutbola.\u201d Older fans marvel at the numbers involved now. \u201cIt became more like a type of sport,\u201d said Ivan Sergeev, 37, a well-known former member of a top Moscow firm, Union, whose nickname is Il Duce. On a recent evening, two dozen young men gathered in a stylish Moscow gym. Wearing skull masks to shield their faces, they went through a warm-up before fighting practice bouts in boxing and wrestling. \u201cIt\u2019s all on a different level now,\u201d said Yevgeny Berezin, who led the session. Berezin fought in organized brawls for 10 years but recently stopped, he said, to focus on acting. The hooligan firms are now effectively underground fight clubs. Older fighters \u2014 usually only in their late 30s or early 40s \u2014 lament that many fighters are uninterested in soccer; one joked that stadium bans won\u2019t work in Russia \u201cbecause our fans don\u2019t go to the football.\u201d The participants are diverse \u2014 construction workers, information technology managers, fitness trainers \u2014 but the most active consider themselves elite fighters with an honor code. They insist they would never attack ordinary fans, only other hooligans. \u201cWhy beat up ordinary people?\u201d Alex said. \u201cIt\u2019s not interesting. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d He and others attributed the attacks on the English in Marseille to overenthusiasm, noting that the Russian fans there were not from top firms \u2014 they were young regional groups at their first big tournament. \u201cThere are some who like to drink and break stools over people\u2019s heads,\u201d Berezin said. \u201cBut that has nothing to do with Okolofutbola. That\u2019s just some kind of hooligans.\u201d Particular pride is taken in fighting exclusively bare-knuckle. Ultratrained hooligans have appeared in other countries \u2014 notably Poland and Germany \u2014 but only in Russia is it seen as having become entwined with the national character. Its supporters also point to the similarities of the fights in the woods to an old peasant game known as stenka na stenku, in which two villages would square off during festivals. For some, organized hooliganism has become a sort of primal expression of uninhibited Russian masculinity, and it appears peculiarly suited to a moment when the Kremlin is cultivating the idea that Russia must rely on its strength alone in its opposition to a bloodless, overcivilized Europe. After Marseille, Putin himself wondered aloud how \u201c200 Russians could thrash several thousand English.\u201d It was perhaps this context that led to an unlikely proposal recently by a Russian politician to make hooliganism a sport. \u201cGiven our fans are fighters, not hooligans,\u201d the politician, Igor Lebedev, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party and of Russia\u2019s national soccer association, wrote on his website, \u201cwe can turn fans\u2019 fights into a sport! Introduce rules, team competitions.\u201d Lebedev\u2019s proposal prompted horror in Europe, but it perhaps more reflected an increasing government effort to separate Russia\u2019s hooligan scene from soccer. Last spring, a brawl between Moscow\u2019s two top firms resulted in house arrest for five fans, including a firm leader. The men face jail time \u2014 an unusually harsh punishment for such a fight. The arrests spooked the fighters, as more detentions followed, as well as frequent searches of fans\u2019 homes. Fans interviewed by The New York Times talked of receiving visits from armed police officers, and of telephone calls warning them that they are being watched. In September, Russia\u2019s national supporters\u2019 club, which represents fans, was shut down, while its chief, Aleksandr Shprygin, was briefly arrested in connection with the same brawl. The next day, Shprygin\u2019s car was set afire by arsonists. The closing of the fan club, which presaged Shprygin\u2019s arrest and arson attack, was viewed as a punishment for his championing the Russian fan violence at the European Championship in France. Since Shprygin is a former hooligan himself, his banishment has been seen as a sign that the Russian authorities didn\u2019t want to appear to be backing violent fans ahead of the World Cup. In reality, though, the pressure on hooligan groups has been growing for years. Fans said it had intensified perceptibly after the 2014 revolution in Ukraine, in which Ukrainian soccer fans were seen as a critical force in battling the police. A previous crackdown followed a 2010 riot by fans in front of the Kremlin. The Interior Ministry\u2019s Department E, responsible for monitoring terrorist and organized crime groups, now also monitors hooligans, with many fans believing their communications are under surveillance. Even the woodland fights have become infrequent, given the increased risk of arrest recently. \u201cThe movement is paralyzed,\u201d Sergeev said. This month, Putin signed legislation imposing harsher punishments for fan misbehavior, introducing lengthy stadium bans. Piara Powar, the director of a fan monitoring group, FARE network, said he was \u201cconfident\u201d that there would be no major trouble at the World Cup. Given the current pressure on fans, and the massive police deployment expected next year, fans here agreed there was little hope of fighting. Not that the hooligans wouldn\u2019t like to. \u201cThere is a huge desire,\u201d said Alex, the RB Warriors member. \u201cBecause when we have such an event happening \u2014 that is, when people from the whole world are coming here \u2014 I really want to.\u201d Describing how it would happen, he said scouts would find foreign hooligans and relay their location. The Russians then would stalk the visitors before launching a surprise attack. \u201cNo one will kill anyone,\u201d Alex said. \u201cJust rough them up a little. You know, a light massage.\u201d It would be such a shame not to, he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t arrest me,\u201d he said, \u201cthen in 2018, God willing, I will beat someone.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/soccer/russian-hooligans-toughest-opponents-russias-police.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T08:43:15-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T08:43:15-04:00", "abstract": "As their nation prepares to host next year\u2019s World Cup, hard-core fans \u2014 in top fighting shape from organized brawls and mixed-martial-arts training \u2014 are facing a crackdown.", "title": "Russian Hooligans\u2019 Toughest Opponents?
