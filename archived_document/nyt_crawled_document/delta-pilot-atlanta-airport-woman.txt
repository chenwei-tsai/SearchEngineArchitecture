{"text": "In the latest airline episode captured on video, two women can be seen exchanging blows on a jet bridge at the Atlanta airport on April 21 when a Delta Air Lines pilot appears to grab one woman and smack her before stepping back. In two videos, shared Saturday by TMZ, a woman is seen rushing headlong into another woman. Some expletives are heard and a man says, \u201cKnock it off.\u201d As the women tussle on the ground, the pilot steps in and appears to grab one woman\u2019s arm and then delivers a blow. A third woman can be seen kicking at the two women and then sitting on them. Delta officials said in a statement on Saturday that they immediately removed the pilot from duty after being made aware last week of the scuffle, which occurred as passengers were deplaning Flight 1827, which flies between Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The pilot has since returned to work, Delta officials said, because their investigation revealed that \u201chis actions de-escalated an altercation between passengers.\u201d The police responded to the dispute at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Delta said. But on Saturday, an Atlanta Police Department spokesman, Sgt. Warren Pickard, said that information could not be provided until Monday. The episode comes on the heels of a high-profile debacle, in which a United Airlines passenger, Dr. David Dao, was dragged off an overbooked plane this month in Chicago by airport police to make room for United staff. Videos of the event sparked widespread outrage. United has since reached a settlement with Dr. Dao, who has said that he suffered a concussion and a broken nose and lost two teeth as a result of the episode. This past week, an American Airlines flight attendant was suspended after he grabbed a stroller from a woman traveling with young children and argued with other passengers on April 21 at San Francisco International Airport. The episode was also recorded, in part, on video.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/us/delta-pilot-atlanta-airport-woman.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T17:30:31-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T17:30:31-04:00", "abstract": "An investigation by Delta found the pilot\u2019s actions helped \u201cde-escalate\u201d the fight between passengers, in the latest airline episode to be recorded on video.", "title": "Video Captures Delta Pilot Smacking Woman to Break Up Fight"}
