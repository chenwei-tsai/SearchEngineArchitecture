The international prize celebrates works translated into English and published in Britain, and comes with a cash award of \u00a350,000, or about $64,000, which authors split with their translators. It is distinct from the Man Booker Prize, which goes to works originally published in English. The nominees are: \u2022 The French author Mathias \u00c9nard\u2019s \u201cCompass,\u201d which centers on the memories and reveries of an insomniac music scholar (translated by Charlotte Mandell). \u2022 The Israeli author David Grossman\u2019s \u201cA Horse Walks Into a Bar,\u201d about a comedian who dissolves in front of an audience\u2019s eyes at a provincial Israeli nightclub (translated by Jessica Cohen). \u2022 The Norwegian author Roy Jacobsen\u2019s \u201cThe Unseen,\u201d about a family living on a small Scandinavian fishing island (translated by Don Bartlett and Don Shaw). \u2022 The Danish author Dorthe Nors\u2019s \u201cMirror, Shoulder, Signal,\u201d about a middle-aged woman\u2019s attempts to learn to drive (translated by Misha Hoekstra). \u2022 The Israeli author Amos Oz\u2019s \u201cJudas,\u201d a coming-of-age story set in mid-20th-century Jerusalem (translated by Nicholas de Lange). \u2022 The Argentine author Samanta Schweblin\u2019s \u201cFever Dream,\u201d which opens with a woman on her deathbed at a clinic in rural Argentina, then slowly reveals how she got there (translated by Megan McDowell). \u201cEvery single one of these six books could win,\u201d Nick Barley, the chairman of the prize\u2019s judging panel, said at a news media briefing in London on Thursday. In 2015, the Booker Prize Foundation revamped the international prize to make it for a specific book. It had previously gone to an author\u2019s entire body of work. The South Korean novelist Han Kang won the first iteration of the new prize last year for her quirky novel \u201cThe Vegetarian,\u201d about a woman who believes she is turning into a tree. The shortlist was winnowed down from a longlist of 13 novels announced in March.
