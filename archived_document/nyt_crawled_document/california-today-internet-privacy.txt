(Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) President Trump this month signed a resolution to undo internet privacy rules that would have kept companies like AT&T and Comcast from selling users\u2019 browsing histories and other personal data. Almost immediately, a number of states \u2014 among them Washington, Connecticut and Massachusetts \u2014 moved to pass new rules that would in effect replicate those nullified by Congress. But California, a pioneer of privacy protections, has so far been silent. That could soon change. Assemblyman Ed Chau, a Democrat who heads the Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee, said he was holding meetings on steps the Legislature could take to safeguard personal information. \u201cCalifornia has been at the leading edge of innovation in approaching privacy issues and consumer protection for years, and there is no reason for that to change,\u201d he said in a statement. Some lawmakers have argued that the privacy rules, drafted last October by the Federal Communications Commission, would have unfairly targeted telecom carriers, while sparing web companies like Google and Facebook that also provide access to user data. \u201cThey really created an unlevel playing field,\u201d said State Senator Joel Anderson, a Republican who has worked on digital privacy. He added, \u201cThey gave free rein to Google and to Facebook.\u201d Privacy groups have noted that consumers can avoid a website with objectionable user terms. But to go online, you have to contract with a broadband provider. That doesn\u2019t mean letting the web services off the hook, said Richard Holober, executive director of the Consumer Federation of California, a nonprofit. \u201cWe\u2019d love them to go after Google,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you start with the folks who have unfettered control of watching everything you\u2019re doing.\u201d Any effort to reproduce the overturned federal rules in California is by no means a lock. Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of California, said lawmakers had introduced \u201cmany, many bills\u201d over the years intended to shore up digital privacy. \u201cUnfortunately, very few of them have been signed into law,\u201d she said. One of those was in 2015, when Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that required law enforcement to get a warrant before accessing user data. The latest privacy debate, however, differs in a crucial way: It threatens business interests in a state where tech companies enjoy tremendous influence. \u201cTechnology is a very large industry in California,\u201d Ms. Ozer said, \u201cso I think there are a lot of legislators who are very cognizant of those issues.\u201d (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) \u2022 U.C.

(See definitions below.) \u201cTalk Like a Californian\u201d is a pronunciation and slang guide to the state. The author, Colleen Dunn Bates (who uses the pen name Helena Ventura), said she wrote the slim book mostly for fun. But it could also help save new arrivals to California from embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the same thing my whole life: people moving to L.A. and pronouncing Sepulveda, Sep-ul-VAY-duh,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those rituals of shame that newcomers to L.A. go through.\u201d Beyond helpful pronunciations, the book gives a slang tour according to a few linguistic categories: statewide, Northern California, Southern California, Hollywood, surfer and tech. Some excerpts: Statewide Hustle: Your work. Yee: Yeah. The Bay Area claims it as its own, but it\u2019s statewide now. Northern California Dubs: The Golden State Warriors Finna: About to, or going to. Yaddadi-mean: You know what I mean?
