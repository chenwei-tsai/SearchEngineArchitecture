{"text": "Frederick H. Borsch, who as the Episcopal bishop of Los Angeles crusaded for an inclusive social justice agenda that empowered women, gays and lesbians, blacks and Hispanics, and poor and low-wage workers, died on April 11 at his home in Philadelphia. He was 81. The cause was myelodysplastic syndromes, a form of blood cancer, the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles said. Between positions at Princeton and Yale, Bishop Borsch presided over the sprawling six-county Southern California diocese from 1988 to 2002, and there he elevated female and Hispanic clergy in the church hierarchy. Despite opposition from the world\u2019s Anglican bishops, he championed the ordination not only of celibate gay men and lesbians but also of those in committed monogamous relationships. Bishop Borsch didn\u2019t just talk. He walked the picket line outside a Beverly Hills hotel with workers demanding what they called a living wage and helped convince Mayor Richard J. Riordan that minimum pay should be higher. When a black priest was unjustly detained and handcuffed during a routine stop, Bishop Borsch demanded, and received, a public apology from the Los Angeles Police Department. His supporters were not the least bit surprised when he chose to build the diocesan headquarters, the Cathedral Center of St. Paul, in Echo Park, an ethnically diverse neighborhood in Central Los Angeles. (Nor were they surprised when, characteristically modest, he initially resisted installing the bishop\u2019s ceremonial throne at the cathedral, although he later acknowledged with a grin, \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly comfortable.\u201d) Frederick Houk Borsch was born on Sept. 13, 1935, in suburban Oak Park, Ill., to Reuben Borsch and the former Pearl Houk. His father played baseball with a St. Louis Cardinals farm club before becoming a Rhodes Scholar and a lawyer. Given Frederick Borsch\u2019s preference for scholarship and teaching (and only fanciful hopes of being recruited to the Dodger bullpen), he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature in 1957 from Princeton and expected that he would become a lawyer like his father or teach college English. But although as a young acolyte he rejected a suggestion from his parish priest to enter the priesthood, the question lingered. His goal remained to somehow make the world a better place, and he began to gravitate to another calling. \u201cI began to feel more and more the real heart of that was related to faith,\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times in 1999, \u201cto giving people hope in life.\u201d Instead of entering law or teaching, he received a bachelor of sacred theology degree from the General Theological Seminary in New York, a bachelor\u2019s in theology from Oxford and a doctorate from the University of Birmingham in England. He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Edgeley Sampson; their sons, Benjamin, Matthew and Stuart; four grandchildren; and his sister, Jane Borsch Robbins. Before being elected bishop, he was dean of the chapel and professor of religion at Princeton and dean, president and a professor at Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif. After his retirement in Los Angeles, he moved to New Haven to be interim dean of the Berkeley Divinity School \u2014 the Episcopal seminary at Yale \u2014 and associate dean of the Yale Divinity School. At his death, he was a professor of New Testament studies and the chairman of Anglican studies at the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. He was the author of 20 books, including two novels. When riots erupted in Los Angeles, fed by the acquittal of four police officers accused of beating a black taxi driver, Rodney King, in 1991, Bishop Borsch wrote, \u201cIn biblical terms, if the society fails to care for the poor, for the widows, the orphans and the strangers in their midst, that society will come to tragedy.\u201d He advocated the 1988 election of Barbara C. Harris as the first woman ordained a bishop in the Anglican Communion. And he helped chart the defense strategy in the 1996 heresy trial in which Bishop Walter C. Righter of Iowa was exonerated for ordaining a partnered gay man as a deacon. Bishop Borsch was forever seeking answers. In The Christian Century magazine in 1995, he asked, \u201cWhere Was God When the Plane Crashed?\u201d \u2014 a meditation on his survival when a DC-10 skidded off the runway on a snowy evening in Boston in an accident that claimed two lives. \u201cThe God who cannot be seen is yet present as the Spirit of all that is,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwilling to share in all the consequences of creation \u2014 including evil and suffering \u2014 and seeking to transform them through love.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "section": "U.S.", "created_date": "2017-04-18T12:47:25-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/frederick-borsch-dead-liberal-los-angles-episcopal-bishop.html", "title": "Frederick Borsch, Bishop Who Worked to Empower Minorities, Dies at 81", "item_type": "Article", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "abstract": "As leader of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles from 1988 to 2002, he elevated female and Hispanic clergy.
