{"text": "The New York teams meet the Beltway teams this weekend, and it\u2019s like the old \u201cSesame Street\u201d jingle: One of these things is not like the other. Let\u2019s look at the major league standings entering Friday. The best winning percentage belonged to the Washington Nationals. Next: the Baltimore Orioles. Third: the Yankees. All were playing .650 or better. So who doesn\u2019t belong? Did you guess the Mets? Yes, alas, the Mets were the outlier. They started play in Washington on Friday with just one victory in the last two weeks, which is really tough to do in a sport that plays almost every day. It is possible if you lose 10 of 11 and mix in two off-days and a rainout, and that is what the Mets did. Who said they couldn\u2019t be amazin\u2019? We are obligated to mention here that the season is very long, and that it is still April \u2014 even though, predictably, it felt like summer on Friday, as soon as the Mets left town. It was hard to see all this coming. In trying to defend their 2015 pennant last season, the Mets admirably claimed the top National League wild-card spot despite a merciless string of injuries. The Yankees traded veterans and made a stronger commitment to youth than they had in decades. The Mets were the team of today, the Yankees the team of tomorrow. It was a convenient story line rooted in the expectations of the teams\u2019 front offices \u2014 but, of course, there was room for surprises. What if, for example, the Mets just kept getting injured? What if their offense became the worst version of itself, helpless to do anything but hit home runs? And what if the Yankees\u2019 veteran position players started strong while the younger ones thrived? What if the shaky rotation was sturdy enough to keep the dominant bullpen fresh? We know the early answers to those questions \u2014 and the most surprising, clearly, is the strength of the Yankees\u2019 pitching. The team\u2019s 2.90 E.R.A. was the lowest in the majors at the start of play on Friday, as was the .214 opponents\u2019 average. The Yankees\u2019 bullpen had thrown just 53 \u2154 innings, the fewest in the majors, because the starters had been so productive. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be like that every night, but that\u2019s what you need to have a winning team,\u201d reliever Tyler Clippard said. \u201cYou have to have a good starting rotation, because everything falls in line when that happens. You get consistent, good outings from your starters, your bullpen\u2019s going to be fresh, and usually if they\u2019re going that deep in games, they\u2019re pitching well, too. So it goes hand in hand.\u201d Even with catcher Gary Sanchez on the disabled list \u2014 and shortstop Didi Gregorius just now making his return \u2014 the Yankees had the majors\u2019 best run differential, at plus-35, before Friday. They could not have counted on Chase Headley and Aaron Hicks hitting well above .300, but they had more serious doubts about the rotation. Yet Masahiro Tanaka, C. C. Sabathia, Michael Pineda, Luis Severino and Jordan Montgomery have made all their starts and almost always given the Yankees a chance to win. Sabathia, who had knee surgery last winter, had a 2.70 E.R.A. before facing the Orioles on Friday, following Tanaka\u2019s shutout in Boston the night before. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried; I felt the talent was there,\u201d Manager Joe Girardi said, explaining his level of concern in spring training. \u201cI think it was difficult trying to figure out who the fourth and fifth starters were going to be. I wasn\u2019t worried about Tanaka; he had a great spring, and he was the one who started off the slowest, so that makes no sense. C. C., I liked where he was considering he was coming off a procedure, and by the end I felt pretty good about him.\u201d Pineda struggled in his final exhibition start, Girardi added, and it took nearly the full length of spring training to decide on Severino and Montgomery. Severino had gone 0-8 with a ghastly 8.50 E.R.A. as a starter last season, and Montgomery had never pitched in the majors. Montgomery has gotten by \u2014 despite a .306 opponents\u2019 average \u2014 but Severino has been a revelation. He has 33 strikeouts with just four walks, and opponents have hit .175 against him. \u201cIt\u2019s command of his fastball,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cI think his slider has had more depth and has been more consistent at times. I think it ran into somewhat of a cutter last year; he was kind of throwing through it. And his changeup has improved. Those are the three differences for him.\u201d The most electrifying young pitcher in New York this month is still the Mets\u2019 Noah Syndergaard, who has 30 strikeouts and no walks while allowing no home runs. But Syndergaard was scratched from Thursday\u2019s start with a biceps injury, and he has also dealt with blister and fingernail problems. Deep down, the Mets must be exhausted by the constant, almost chronic drumbeat of injuries \u2014 minor and major \u2014 that stalk their roster. Now Yoenis Cespedes, the most dynamic hitter in town, is on the disabled list with a left hamstring strain, just in time for the weekend visit to Washington. Because this is baseball \u2014 where nobody really knows anything \u2014 the Mets will probably surge in May and the Yankees will fade. But for now, anyway, the Yankees are stealing the Mets\u2019 moment.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/baseball/new-york-mets-yankees.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T21:04:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T21:04:10-04:00", "abstract": "Before the season, the Mets were regarded as the team of today, while the Yankees were seen as building for the future.
