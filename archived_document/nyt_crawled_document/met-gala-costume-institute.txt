{"text": "This year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute paid tribute to Rei Kawakubo, the Japanese designer with a penchant for all things edgy and asymmetrical. There were wedding gowns that suggested \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d by way of Tim Burton. There were jackets that appeared to have been made from pipe cleaners. So what was that shiny spring dress that Anna Wintour rolled in wearing at 6 p.m. on Monday? \u201cChanel,\u201d she said. And the last time she wore Ms. Kawakubo\u2019s line, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons? \u201cSometime back in the \u201880s,\u201d Ms. Wintour said, letting that hang out there with all the implicit meaning one might read into it. Anyway, Ms. Wintour was not alone. In years past, people have taken the themes very seriously. This time, it was more like a general invitation to let the freak flags fly, and so lots of people did. Katy Perry wore a red veil and dress by John Galliano for Maison Martin Margiela that left her looking like the bride of Frankenstein. Nicki Minaj was more \u201cElvira: Mistress of the Dark\u201d by way of a Las Vegas showgirl in a caped black and red dress that was designed with H&M. The bright spot? \u201cIt\u2019s not that uncomfortable,\u201d she said. Helen Lasichanh \u2014 the wife of this year\u2019s co-host, Pharrell Williams \u2014 should have been so lucky. She was stuffed into a bright red Comme des Gar\u00e7ons gown that actually had no arms. So while Mr. Williams stood by her talking about how easy it was to put on his ripped jeans and plaid CDG jacket (\u201cI\u2019m a man,\u201d he said), her preparation process was more involved. \u201cWeekend at Bernie\u2019s\u201d was the metaphor Mr. Williams reached for to describe it. By 8 p.m., the stairs leading up to the event were filled with celebrities. One minute, Kendall Jenner ascended, wearing a La Perla gown that showed off pretty much everything underneath it. Just behind her was Lena Dunham, in an Elizabeth Kennedy-designed, gingham-accented gown with ruffles. It definitely had an Comme des Gar\u00e7ons influence to it. \u201cWe really took the theme to heart,\u201d she said. \u201cWe even forced Ms. Wintour to weigh in.\u201d Of course. Because the Met Gala serves as Vogue\u2019s biggest branding opportunity, and because the money it raises for the Costume Institute makes up the center\u2019s entire budget, many glittery attendees wore designers that the magazine effectively paired them with. And every big celebrity had a big fashion date. Jennifer Lopez arrived in a sky blue Valentino gown, flanked not just by her new boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez, but also Valentino himself. (The company\u2019s new designer, Pierpaolo Piccioli, was there, too, with the Oscar-nominated actress Ruth Negga.) Kerry Washington arrived with Michael Kors and wore one of his gowns, which had lots of metallic details, along with holes that were cut into it to pay an homage to Ms. Kawakubo. \u201cIt\u2019s Park Avenue punk,\u201d he said. \u201cSpence girl punk,\u201d chimed in Ms. Washington. Many of the people one most wanted to hear from ran up the stairs quickest, avoiding the queries of attendant reporters. This included Thomas Campbell, the outgoing director of the Met, who stepped down this year. As well as Megyn Kelly, although she at least acknowledged the reason she wasn\u2019t giving interviews. \u201cI know what you guys want to ask,\u201d she said, alluding to the recent turmoil at Fox News, which on Monday announced the departure of its co-president, Bill Shine. Madonna arrived near the end of the cocktail hour. She wore a slinky camouflage-patterned gown and was flanked by its designer, Jeremy Scott. Sarah Paulson (in Prada) held her train, and a publicist stood at the ready with an Army-green canteen for her to sip from as she worked her way up the press line. \u201cI picked it up and started galloping her like a horse,\u201d Ms. Paulson said. But Madonna was not doing a lot of interviews either. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, making her way inside as she blamed her publicist. \u201cI have to do whatever he says.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/style/met-gala-costume-institute.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Style", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T23:09:39-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T23:09:39-04:00", "abstract": "The shiny, spacey and edgy reigned at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute Gala.
