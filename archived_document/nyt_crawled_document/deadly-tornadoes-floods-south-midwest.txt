{"text": "CANTON, Texas \u2014 At least nine people were killed by tornadoes or flooding this weekend in a series of storms in the South and Midwest that also brought a rare late-season blizzard to western Kansas on Sunday. Tornadoes hit several small towns in East Texas, killing four people. Three people were killed by flooding and winds in Arkansas, and officials said they were searching for two more people. Rushing water swept away a car, drowning a woman in Missouri, and a death was reported in storms that raked Mississippi on Sunday morning. Flooding closed part of Interstate 44 near Hazelgreen, Mo., and officials said it would be at least a day before the highway reopened. Interstate 70 in western Kansas was closed as crews waited for snow falling at 3 to 4 inches an hour being blown by 35-mile-per-hour winds to subside. Rescuers in northwest Arkansas on Sunday continued to look for an 18-month-old girl and a 4-year-old boy who were in a vehicle swept off a bridge by floodwaters in Hindsville, the Madison County sheriff\u2019s office said. Also in northwest Arkansas, a 10-year-old girl drowned in Springdale, and the body of a woman who disappeared while riding an inner tube on Saturday was found in a creek in Eureka Springs. In the state\u2019s east, a 65-year-old woman in DeWitt was struck and killed in her home by a falling tree, officials said. In Texas, search teams were going door to door on Sunday after tornadoes the day before flattened homes, uprooted trees and flipped several pickup trucks at a Dodge dealership in Canton. \u201cIt is heartbreaking and upsetting, to say the least,\u201d Mayor Lou Ann Everett told reporters at a news conference in Canton. The storms cut a path of destruction 35 miles long and 15 miles wide in Van Zandt County, she said. The largely rural area is about 50 miles east of Dallas. The National Weather Service found evidence of four tornadoes, with one possibly on the ground for 50 miles. The storms rolled through Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on Sunday, with strong winds causing isolated pockets of damage. In Durant, a town in central Mississippi, one person died.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/deadly-tornadoes-floods-south-midwest.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T19:01:15-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T19:01:15-04:00", "abstract": "A rare late-season blizzard also hit western Kansas this weekend.", "title": "Tornadoes and Flooding in South and Midwest Kill at Least 9"}
