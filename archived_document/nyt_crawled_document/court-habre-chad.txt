{"text": "DAKAR, Senegal \u2014 A court in Senegal on Thursday upheld the war crimes conviction of Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9, the former leader of a murderous regime in Chad, keeping in place a life sentence and establishing a trust fund for scores of victims who fought for years to bring him to justice. It took an hour for the court to read a summary of its more than 200-page ruling on an appeal from Mr. Habr\u00e9, who did not appear in court. Mr. Habr\u00e9 has dismissed the entire case against him as sham justice by a court that he has contended has no jurisdiction. Reed Brody, a lawyer who has pursued the case since 1999 on behalf of victims, said the ruling was significant. \u201cHabr\u00e9\u2019s life sentence is a powerful message that the days when tyrants could brutalize their people, pillage their treasury and escape abroad to a life of luxury are coming to an end,\u201d he said. A special court was created in Senegal, where Mr. Habr\u00e9 has been living in exile, to hear his case. The court convicted him last May of crimes against humanity and of torture. The panel of judges on Thursday dismissed a sex crimes charge against Mr. Habr\u00e9. Some of Mr. Habr\u00e9\u2019s victims were in court to hear the ruling. \u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d said Souleymane Guengueng, who nearly died of mistreatment and disease in Mr. Habr\u00e9\u2019s prisons. \u201cI hope that all the dictators in Africa take notice \u2014 no one is above the law.\u201d Rights advocates credit Mr. Guengueng\u2019s meticulous record-keeping for helping secure a conviction. He recorded the testimonies of hundreds of victims and their family members who suffered under Mr. Habr\u00e9\u2019s rule. According to a Chadian truth commission, Mr. Habr\u00e9\u2019s government killed more than 40,000 people who were accused of being enemies of the state, or who had merely come under suspicion. He was president from 1982 to 1990, when he was deposed by the current president, Idriss D\u00e9by. The ruling on Thursday cements a court victory that will be used as a blueprint to hunt dictators across the world, rights experts said. The ruling also established a $136 million trust fund, to be run by the African Union, to aid thousands affected by Mr. Habr\u00e9\u2019s brutality. Mr. Habr\u00e9\u2019s victims are still working to track his wealth, a complicated endeavor involving bank accounts in several nations. The court has frozen some assets belonging to the former president, including a house in an upscale neighborhood of Dakar, the Senegalese capital, that is thought to be worth about $750,000 and some bank accounts.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/africa/court-habre-chad.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T09:29:26-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T09:29:26-04:00", "abstract": "The ruling cements a verdict that could be used to hunt dictators around the world, rights experts said.", "title": "Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9, Ex-Ruler of Chad, Loses War Crimes Appeal"}
