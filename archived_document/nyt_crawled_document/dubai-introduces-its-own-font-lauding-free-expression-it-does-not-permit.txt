{"text": "Dubai has long had a taste for the finer things in life. The influential Persian Gulf city has been home to the world\u2019s tallest building, a hotel that offers guests private butlers and 24-karat-gold iPads, and even a bakery that sold gold-laced cupcakes for roughly $1,000 each. Now it is getting attention for a slightly less flashy effort that may soon be coming to a word-processing program near you: Dubai has made its own font. The font was announced on Sunday morning in a series of near-simultaneous posts on Twitter from a regional division of Microsoft and Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the crown prince of Dubai. In a tweet, the prince called the font a \u201cunique project that reflects heritage and culture\u201d of the United Arab Emirates, the seven-member federation that Dubai is part of, \u201cand reaches out to the whole world.\u201d The new font comes in both Arabic and Latin script and is available as part of Microsoft Office 365. On Sunday, Prince Hamdan shared a video on Twitter that presented it as a powerful tool for self-expression. \u201cExpression knows no boundaries or limits,\u201d the video said. \u201cExpression is strength and freedom. It defines who you are.\u201d As it turns out, though, there are quite a few boundaries and limits on expression in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates, where the news media is censored to remove criticism of the government or the coalition of royal families that controls it. Last week, the U.A.E. blocked access to the Arabic-language website of HuffPost, the latest in a series of moves to tighten access to the internet. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing from Dubai\u2019s new motto is a little asterisk with fine print, \u2018Except that anyone who says something the emirs don\u2019t like goes to jail,\u2019\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. She pointed to the case of Ahmad Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist who was arrested last month. A spokesman for Microsoft did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Sunday. The United Arab Emirates has no democratically elected institutions and no formal commitment to free speech. It has been accused of systemic human rights abuses, including torture and the forced disappearance of government critics. A majority of its population \u2014 at least 85 percent \u2014 is made up of foreign workers who do not enjoy the privileges of citizenship. What it does have is wealth, derived largely from its role as a global business hub. On Twitter, the crown prince described the new font as an important step toward elevating the country\u2019s global business profile. He did not explain how exactly that would work. Human rights activists have accused the U.A.E. of using its great wealth to silence dissent and present a positive image of itself to the outside world. Ms. Whitson advised the country\u2019s business partners, like Microsoft, to \u201cscratch the surface of their paychecks and take a close, hard look at the disturbing abuses of its clients.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/world/middleeast/dubai-introduces-its-own-font-lauding-free-expression-it-does-not-permit.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T17:46:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T17:46:07-04:00", "abstract": "A video shared by the city\u2019s crown prince says that \u201cexpression knows no boundaries or limits,\u201d but within the United Arab Emirates that is not the case.", "title": "Dubai Introduces Its Own Font, Lauding Free Expression It Does Not Permit"}
