Tucker Carlson will assume Fox News\u2019s 8 p.m. time slot on Monday, the first time in nearly two decades that Bill O\u2019Reilly will not be kicking off Fox News\u2019s prime-time lineup. And Fox\u2019s competitors are taking notice. Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s dismissal amounts to an enormous shift in cable news, and the TV industry was ablaze with talk late last week whether the move has the potential to open up a cable news war that for more than a decade has been dominated by Fox News. It was already expected to be a big week for cable news. Though the 100-day mark for Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency is mostly symbolic, the cable networks were preparing to cover it the way only they can: as a TV spectacle. MSNBC was preparing a big week of programming, CNN invited its daytime anchor Jake Tapper to take over its 9 p.m. hour all week, and Mr. O\u2019Reilly was supposed to return from a vacation to resume his role as the top-rated host in cable news. It will be even bigger now. In addition to Mr. Tucker moving to 8 p.m., Fox\u2019s afternoon opinion round-table show, \u201cThe Five\u201d will move into the 9 p.m. slot, followed by Sean Hannity. It is an untested lineup, and some TV executives argued that Fox could be the most vulnerable it has been in years, particularly with MSNBC and CNN surging. It remains an open question whether Mr. Carlson can effectively kick off Fox\u2019s prime-time lineup \u2014 something Mr. O\u2019Reilly has done since the late 1990s \u2014 and provide a strong lead-in to the other shows, or whether \u201cThe Five,\u2019\u2019 with co-hosts who lack the star power of Fox\u2019s other prime-time personalities, can draw a big audience. Others contend that Fox\u2019s viewers are loyal. Even if it takes a small ratings hit, the network\u2019s lead is daunting, and its viewers certainly will not be switching over to CNN or MSNBC. \u201cThere\u2019s vulnerability in that Fox\u2019s biggest star is gone,\u201d said Andrew Heyward, the former president of CBS News, referring to Mr. O\u2019Reilly. \u201cThere will be resentment among his loyal base.\u201d Still, Mr. Heyward continued, \u201cWhat mitigates that, of course, is that Fox\u2019s success is tied to being sui generis. There is no viable alternative for people who want to have that perspective played back all through prime time.\u201d So far, there are mixed signals. On the day Mr. O\u2019Reilly was dismissed, his show \u2014 its title shortened from \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u2019\u2019 to just \u201cThe Factor\u201d \u2014 was hosted by Dana Perino. About 3.3 million viewers tuned in, twice the audience of \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes\u201d on MSNBC. But by Thursday of last week, viewership fell to 2.7 million viewers. Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s last episode as host on April 11 brought in 3.6 million viewers. Not long ago, cable news was a fading genre; viewership and ratings were dropping and the viewers it did have were aging as digital platforms took away the younger audience that is more attractive to advertisers. That all changed after Mr. Trump announced he was running for president 22 months ago. Last year\u2019s election helped produced record ratings for the cable news networks. Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has not guaranteed rating gains across the board: Ratings have declined for all of the evening news and morning shows on the broadcast networks this year, suggesting that general-interest viewers may be growing fatigued by a news cycle dominated by Mr. Trump and politics. But cable news viewers, flocking to programming that aligns with their political views, cannot get enough of it. Fox\u2019s ratings are enormous, and MSNBC and CNN are in their strongest competitive positions in years. MSNBC\u2019s prime-time left-leaning lineup was tailor-made for those seeking oppositional programming to the current administration. Rachel Maddow, MSNBC\u2019s 9 p.m. host, is on a hot streak, and in recent weeks started beating Mr. Carlson among the coveted 25- to 54-year-olds vital to advertisers. CNN, is likewise gaining in the ratings \u2014 up 14 percent in total viewers and 25 percent in the demographic compared with this time last year \u2014 despite competing against itself in a year when it hosted numerous debates and town halls. CNN executives have been reluctant to describe Mr. Tapper\u2019s prime-time move next week as a trial run, but if he does well, it could be an opening for him to make a move. Still, Fox is well out in front of both CNN and MSNBC. In prime time, the network averages more than 2.8 million viewers, while MSNBC draws half of that at 1.4 million and CNN averages 1.2 million. In the 25- to 54-year-old demographic, Fox News also commands a large lead \u2014 576,000 viewers a night, compared with 405,000 for CNN and 337,000 for MSNBC. If there\u2019s been one weakness to Fox\u2019s dominance, it is the age of its audience. The median age of the Fox News prime-time viewer is 66, a few years older than for MSNBC (64) and CNN (59), according to Nielsen. Some TV executives said on Wednesday that with such a sizable lead, Fox\u2019s biggest threat will not come from rival networks but from challenges to the monopoly it has held on conservative commentary on nightly television. What could keep Fox inoculated from any kind of significant defection is the lack of choice on the dial. MSNBC\u2019s prime-time lineup is now defiantly positioned against the Trump administration, and CNN, though it has plenty of pro-Trump voices, has drawn withering criticism from the president. \u201cFox News viewers are old enough to remember, \u2018Don\u2019t touch that dial,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Heyward. \u201cWell, if they do touch the dial, there aren\u2019t a lot of places for them to go.\u201d", "abstract": "For the first time in nearly two decades, Bill O\u2019Reilly will not be kicking off Fox News\u2019s prime-time lineup. The other cable networks have noticed."}
