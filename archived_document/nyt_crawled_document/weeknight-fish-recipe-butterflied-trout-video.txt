{"text": "There are excellent reasons to cook a whole fish, rather than fillets. The skin and bones add enormous amounts of flavor to the flesh, and they also keep it from drying out, which gives you a wider margin of error. There are many times, though, when whole fish just can\u2019t be on my menu. Like when I am in the mood for salmon, and the entire animal would be too much for my small family, or when I\u2019m serving people who don\u2019t like to stare down their dinner. Most often, though, I choose fillets over whole fish for their cooking speed. There are few things faster and easier than broiling a couple of fillets rubbed with an herb-flecked compound butter. But there is a solution that marries the convenience of a fillet with the succulence of a whole fish: butterflied trout. The prep work is simple. Butterflied trout doesn\u2019t have bones to maneuver around, and it needn\u2019t have the head either. (If yours comes with the head still attached, lop it off with a sharp knife.) It does still come wrapped in its skin, though, and because the fillets are thin, there is a high skin-to-flesh ratio. Even if you\u2019re not fond of eating the skin, its presence intensifies the flavor of the fillets and keeps them nice and juicy. And if you are a fish skin fan, there is more of it to savor, preferably when its crisp and salty. The technique for broiled butterflied trout is as simple as it gets. Spread the fish open on a baking pan, season with a little salt and pepper and broil as close to your heat source as possible, until the center of the flesh turns opaque and the edges curl and brown. You can mix the herb butter together while the fish is in the oven \u2014 that is, as long as you\u2019ve taken the butter out of the refrigerator in advance so it\u2019s soft and supple. Better yet, keep some butter on the counter so you will always have spreadable butter on hand (it can last for a week or so without refrigeration). At this point, all that\u2019s left to do is add a final garnish. For a weeknight meal, capers add a nice, inexpensive pop of salinity and crunch. Or if you want to turn this into something more deluxe for company, sprinkle the fish with trout or salmon roe. The shimmering orange pearls add a similar salty burst but are a lot more elegant \u2014 and it\u2019s just as quick for the cook.
