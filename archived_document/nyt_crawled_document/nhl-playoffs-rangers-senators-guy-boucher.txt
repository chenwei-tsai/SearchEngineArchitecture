{"text": "Ottawa Senators Coach Guy Boucher could pass for a college professor when he wears thin-rimmed glasses and gives erudite soliloquies. But he does not want the front-of-the-classroom spotlight. The savvy Boucher would rather credit the players who have excelled during his first year as coach. Ottawa leads the Rangers by two games to none as their best-of-seven playoff series shifts to Madison Square Garden for Game 3 on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about me, it\u2019s about our players,\u201d said Boucher, 45, who was hired last May after the Senators missed the playoffs and fired Dave Cameron. \u201cThey are the ones who deserve the credit for how they\u2019ve developed, stuck together and created a soul inside that group.\u201d His team appeared relaxed and loose as it went through its paces at practice Monday at the Garden. The pressure of the games ahead against the favored Rangers was not fazing Ottawa\u2019s skaters or their coach. \u201cWhat I like about our players is that we\u2019ve worked on reloading mentally and emotionally from great moments and bad moments all year long,\u201d Boucher said. \u201cAnd what I like is that it did translate to the playoffs, which is why we are still here. That\u2019s what you need in the playoffs.\u201d Ottawa\u2019s players say the precise and exacting Boucher instilled the right dynamic from the first day of training camp. The work ethic Boucher established has carried over into springtime for a franchise that has not advanced past the second round since the 2007 finals against the Anaheim Ducks. \u201cHe\u2019s very prepared and very detailed, and he does a very good job of preparing us,\u201d said defenseman Dion Phaneuf, who was formerly captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs. \u201cAs players, we really like that because he gives us the information we need, and it\u2019s our job to execute his plan.\u201d Boucher has a master\u2019s degree in sports psychology from the University of Montreal, and he spent a year playing in France before starting his coaching career as an assistant at McGill University in Montreal. Success and intensity have characterized Boucher\u2019s career. A native of Notre-Dame-du-Lac, Quebec, Boucher previously coached the Tampa Bay Lightning, whom he had one win from the finals in 2011, and SC Bern in Switzerland, where he won the Swiss Cup in 2015. His defense-first system appears to have the Senators on the same page, and for Mike Hoffman, who scored 26 goals this season, the results for these resurgent Senators are not surprising. He also played for Boucher as a teenager with the Drummondville Voltigeurs, who won the Quebec junior league championship in 2009. \u201cNot much has changed since then,\u201d Hoffman, 27, said. \u201cIt\u2019s still about attention to detail and exact routes and plays. It\u2019s neat that eight years later our paths have crossed again.\u201d Ottawa ousted the more physical Boston Bruins in six games in the first round, and with a two-game advantage over the Rangers, they could take a commanding series lead Tuesday. Jean-Gabriel Pageau, who scored four goals in Saturday\u2019s 6-5 victory, said Boucher\u2019s style had benefited the entire roster. \u201cEveryone when we go out there is relentless; everyone wants to win,\u201d Pageau said. \u201cWe found a way to win, and it\u2019s when we trust our system and when we play in it. As players, we really respect and have bought into his system.\u201d Despite their advantage this series, Boucher will not let his Senators ease up. After Ottawa won the opener, 2-1, Boucher cagily mentioned how most pundits had picked the Rangers to crush his team. \u201cWe are contending every game to win games; how\u2019s that?\u201d he said coyly when asked whether he still considered his squad an underdog to the playoff-savvy Rangers. He has maintained his team\u2019s underdog status, calling the Rangers \u201cStanley Cup contenders.\u201d The Rangers, who finished the regular season with four more wins than the Senators, have played the most playoff games in the league since the start of the 2012 postseason. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to change, especially playing a team like that at home,\u201d Boucher said Monday. He emphasized that flexibility also had to be part of his tool kit heading into the caldron of playoff games where nuances can make the difference. Each of Ottawa\u2019s six postseason wins has been by a margin of one goal. \u201cI keep myself ready to adjust,\u201d he said. Derick Brassard, a former Ranger, said he appreciated Boucher\u2019s no-nonsense approach and how he understood the boundaries in his relationship with his players. Like Phaneuf and Hoffman, Brassard said there were only rare flashes of humor from their ultra-focused coach. \u201cHe\u2019s intense, he\u2019s serious and he likes to communicate with the players,\u201d said Brassard, a Quebec native like Boucher. \u201cHe\u2019s a hockey coach, and with players, there is mutual respect always. But our head coach is not our friend.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/sports/hockey/nhl-playoffs-rangers-senators-guy-boucher.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T20:17:53-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T20:17:53-04:00", "abstract": "In his first year behind the bench in Ottawa, Boucher has taken his team to the second round of the playoffs, where they lead the Rangers by two games.", "title": "Guy Boucher, an Intense Coach, Molds the Ottawa Senators\u2019 Spirit"}
