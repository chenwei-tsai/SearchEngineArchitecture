{"text": "In his first 100 days as president, Donald J. Trump may have found much of his agenda stymied, from a health care overhaul to a hotly contested immigration order. But he can at least point to the biggest stock market rise of any president since the 1980s. In Mr. Trump\u2019s first 100 days, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen about 5 percent, in what supporters have called a \u201cTrump bump.\u201d Only George Bush enjoyed a bigger stock market rise, with the index gaining 7.7 percent in his first 100 days as president in 1989 amid a 15-year low in unemployment and efforts to shore up the battered savings and loan industry. By comparison, in Barack Obama\u2019s first 100 days, the S.&P. rose about 2.8 percent. Under George W. Bush, it fell 7.3 percent, while under Bill Clinton, it rose less than 1 percent. Under Ronald Reagan, it fell about 1 percent. Like most presidents in the modern era, Mr. Trump has both played down and embraced the significance of the 100-day period by which new White Houses have been judged since Franklin D. Roosevelt. He dismissed the 100-day milestone as a \u201cridiculous standard\u201d even as his administration has pushed through a final flurry of actions meant to bolster his report card. Much of the markets\u2019 movements arises from circumstances well beyond any president\u2019s control. When Mr. Obama took office in early 2013, the country was still grappling with the fallout of the global financial crisis that had mired the economy in deep recession. And the younger Mr. Bush assumed the presidency amid the ongoing bursting of the dot-com bubble that wiped out scores of internet stocks. But from the moment that Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, analysts and bankers predicted a bump in the S.&P. based in part on the promises of an overtly business-friendly presidency. Mr. Trump has pledged to lift regulations that he said were stymieing private enterprise, while also ushering in both big tax cuts and greater infrastructure spending.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/dealbook/trump-stocks-100-days-markets.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T16:09:02-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T16:06:41-04:00", "abstract": "The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up about 5 percent since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the best start to for a president since the elder George Bush.", "title": "Trump Buoys Stocks, Giving President a Win for First 100 Days"}
