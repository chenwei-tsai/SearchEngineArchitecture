{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In an early sign of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch\u2019s independence and work ethic, he has decided not to join a labor pool at the Supreme Court in which justices share their law clerks in an effort to streamline decisions about which cases to hear. Justice Gorsuch joined the court last month. His decision not to participate in the pool was confirmed by Kathleen L. Arberg, the court\u2019s public information officer. The only other member of the court who is not part of the arrangement is Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Justices in the pool receive a common \u201cpool memo\u201d on each petition seeking Supreme Court review \u2014 more formally, \u201cpetition for certiorari\u201d \u2014 from a single law clerk. The memo analyzes the petition and makes a recommendation about whether it should be granted. As a law clerk to Justices Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy in 1993 and 1994, a young Neil Gorsuch wrote quite a few such memos. Justices who do not participate, by contrast, have their law clerks review all of the roughly 7,000 petitions filed each year, looking for the 75 or so worthy of the court\u2019s attention. The pool has been criticized for giving too much power to law clerks and for contributing to the court\u2019s shrinking docket. For almost two decades until 2008, only Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired in 2010, stayed out of the pool. He said it had caused \u201cthe lessening of the docket.\u201d \u201cYou stick your neck out as a clerk when you recommend to grant a case,\u201d he told USA Today. \u201cThe risk-averse thing to do is to recommend not to take a case.\u201d Some scholars have traced the decline of the Supreme Court docket to the pool. In the early 1980s, the Supreme Court decided more than 150 cases a year. These days, it decides about half that many. The justices each hire four law clerks, who are recent law school graduates with uniformly stellar credentials. But they are also young and inexperienced, Kenneth W. Starr wrote in 2006 in the Minnesota Law Review. \u201cThe prevailing spirit among the 25-year-old legal savants, whose life experience is necessarily limited in scope, is to seek out and destroy undeserving petitions,\u201d wrote Mr. Starr, a former appeals court judge, solicitor general and independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation. A petition accepted that must later be dismissed as \u201cimprovidently granted\u201d is a significant embarrassment to the clerk in question. On the other hand, it is hard to get into trouble by recommending a denial. Having several clerks review each petition \u2014 the pool clerk and ones from the chambers of Justices Alito and Gorsuch \u2014 would presumably mean that fewer worthy ones fall through the cracks. Pool memos are not public, but some have been released, decades after they were written, in justices\u2019 papers after their deaths. They can seem hedged and homogeneous because they were written for all of the participating justices and not just the clerk\u2019s own justice. The memos in Justice Harry A. Blackmun\u2019s papers made clear they were not the last word in important cases, as Justice Blackmun\u2019s own clerks reviewed and annotated. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who participates in the pool, has cautioned against overstating the clerks\u2019 roles in evaluating petitions seeking review. \u201cThe law clerks are highly intelligent, very able, uncommonly diligent,\u201d she told Docket Sheet, a newsletter published for Supreme Court employees. \u201cThey save us hours upon hours of labor. But most of them are also young and in need of the seasoning that experiences in life and in law practice afford. Whenever I think a case may be \u201dworthy of review \u201c I will do the homework required and will not rely solely on a pool memorandum.\u201d The pool started in the early 1970s, at the suggestion of Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who had come from a law firm. At first, five justices participated. \u201cIn true Washington, D.C., fashion,\u201d Mr. Starr wrote, \u201cthis modest government program has grown significantly and now possesses great power.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/gorsuch-supreme-court-labor-pool-clerks.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T16:42:19-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T16:42:19-04:00", "abstract": "Justice Neil M.
