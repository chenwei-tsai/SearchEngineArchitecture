She was 77. Her death was confirmed by her partner, George Lewis, who said she had breast cancer. Ms. Alvear, a former president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, was a native of Ecuador, born on San Crist\u00f3bal in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands on Nov. 5, 1939. She moved to the United States in 1965 and worked in a congressman\u2019s office before becoming a television news production assistant in 1971. At the time, opportunities for women in journalism were few and opportunities for Latinos were even fewer. As she moved through local television jobs in Los Angeles, Ms. Alvear was often the only member of either group working in news production. But she fought to change the environment. In 1982, NBC News named her to run its Mexico City bureau. From there she covered wars and revolutions in Nicaragua and El Salvador. She also produced several interviews with the Cuban leader Fidel Castro. She was a producer in various NBC bureaus until she retired in 2007. Ms. Alvear did not graduate from college, but she completed a Nieman fellowship at Harvard in 1989. She learned she had breast cancer in 1994, while on assignment in Mexico. After getting treatment she remained clear of the disease until it returned 18 years later. In addition to Mr. Lewis, her survivors include four sisters and two half brothers.", "section": "Business Day", "abstract": "A former president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, she ran NBC\u2019s Mexico City bureau, covered conflicts in Nicaragua and El Salvador and produced interviews with Castro.", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "created_date": "2017-04-26T15:31:01-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/business/media/cecilia-alvear-died-nbc-news-producer.html", "title": "Cecilia Alvear, Trailblazing Latina Journalist at NBC, Dies at 77"}
