{"text": "HONG KONG \u2014 President Trump warned Thursday of the possibility of a \u201cmajor, major conflict\u201d with North Korea in an interview in which he said he was seeking a diplomatic solution to concerns that Pyongyang was preparing to conduct another nuclear test. In the interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump praised President Xi Jinping of China for efforts to resolve the dispute over North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons programs, but cautioned that diplomatic efforts might fail. \u201cThere is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks came amid signs that North Korea might soon conduct another underground detonation at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site despite Mr. Trump\u2019s warning not to do so. China has played a mediating role in the crisis as Mr. Trump has urged Mr. Xi to use Beijing\u2019s leverage with its longtime ally not to conduct a test. \u201cI believe he is trying very hard. He certainly doesn\u2019t want to see turmoil and death. He doesn\u2019t want to see it,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi. \u201cHe is a good man. He is a very good man and I got to know him very well.\u201d In the interview, Mr. Trump actually offered some grudging praise for North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. \u201cHe\u2019s 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime,\u201d he said. \u201cSo say what you want, but that is not easy, especially at that age.\u201d The United States has been pressing the United Nations to impose more sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. The diplomatic efforts have coincided with military maneuvers by the United States and South Korea in Pocheon, northeast of Seoul, where the allies have demonstrated some of their latest weapons. In addition, the Michigan, a submarine armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, has arrived in the South Korean port city of Busan. And a Navy strike group led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson has been sent to the Sea of Japan, which borders the Korean Peninsula. This month, as tensions with North Korea were flaring, the Carl Vinson was said to be sailing north, toward the Peninsula, when it was actually heading south, toward the Indian Ocean. In the interview, Mr. Trump also rejected an overture from Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, for further discussions. His telephone call with her in December alarmed China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province. \u201cMy problem is that I have established a very good personal relationship with President Xi,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI really feel that he is doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation. So I wouldn\u2019t want to be causing difficulty right now for him.\u201d On Thursday, Ms. Tsai had raised the possibility of talking with Mr. Trump again. \u201cWe have the opportunity to communicate more directly with the U.S. government,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t exclude the opportunity to call President Trump himself, but it depends on the needs of the situation and the U.S. government\u2019s consideration of regional affairs.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/asia/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T22:46:27-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T22:46:27-04:00", "abstract": "He praised the Chinese president for efforts to resolve the dispute with the North but cautioned that such diplomatic efforts might fail.", "title": "Trump Warns That \u2018Major, Major Conflict\u2019 With North Korea Is Possible"}
