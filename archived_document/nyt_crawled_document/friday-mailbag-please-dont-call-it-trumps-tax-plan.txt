{"text": "President Trump on Wednesday released what The New York Times called a \u201ctax cut blueprint\u201d (more on this phrasing a bit later), the main element being large cuts for corporations. Also included in the blueprint was the repeal of what The Times referred to as either an \u201cinheritance tax\u201d or an \u201cestate tax.\u201d Republicans sometimes call it a \u201cdeath tax.\u201d (We brought up the issue of using that last term in an earlier mailbag.) Several readers noticed the inconsistent usage and wrote to point it out. We asked Alan Rappeport, an economic policy reporter who covered the tax cut blueprint, whether he could clarify which term is correct: The public editor\u2019s take: I\u2019m no expert in tax law but it does seem as if an estate tax and an inheritance tax are two different things. Glad to have clarity. What to call Trump\u2019s tax cut proposal was a question this week for Times journalists, because, as one Times story noted, the proposal was not so much a plan as \u201ca wish list\u201d \u2014 a \u201cskeletal outline of a tax package\u201d presented in the form of a single page of bullet points. The Times did, though, call the outline a plan at times, which Rappeport attributed to a shortage of ways to describe it. Still, readers and a Times reporter on Twitter, poked fun at the word choice. Two weeks ago, in a story on the death of Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam, The Times reported that both her mother and brother had died by suicide. On Saturday, The Times followed up on the story and included a statement from Judge Abdus-Salaam\u2019s family, which said that the judge\u2019s mother did not commit suicide and that her brother \u201clost his battle with terminal lung cancer.\u201d The story concluded: \u201cLaw enforcement officials acknowledged on Friday that they had erroneous information regarding the death of the judge\u2019s mother.\u201d And a correction was appended to the first story: \u201cAn earlier version of this article misstated the circumstances of the death of Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam\u2019s mother. She died at age 92, but did not take her own life, as two law enforcement officials had said.\u201d Some readers, however, were left puzzled about the nature of the death of Judge Abdus-Salaam\u2019s brother, and wondered why there wasn\u2019t an editors\u2019 note to explain what happened. We asked Dean Chang, deputy Metro editor, about the error and how it has been handled. The public editor\u2019s take: It\u2019s clear that more reporting is needed to clarify matters. And I agree with the reader that this story should have an Editors\u2019 Note. As it is, the second story disagrees with the first, and readers are owed an explanation \u2014 if not now then as soon as additional reporting allows.  Several readers wrote in this week to protest the use of \u201cglobalist\u201d in a story on Trump\u2019s claim that Canada is exploiting American workers. The piece \u2014 referring to Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist \u2014 attributed Trump\u2019s claim to \u201ca comeback by nationalists like Mr. Bannon, who views trade as crucial to Mr. Trump\u2019s populist appeal but whose star has dimmed after clashes with globalist-minded aides like Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs banker and lifelong Democrat who is head of the National Economic Council.\u201d More broadly, the claim was framed as a result of a battle between two competing ideologies, nationalism and globalism. Some readers, however, worried that The Times was uncritically using a term of the so-called \u201calt-right.\u201d We asked Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, whether The Times has considered refraining from using the term. \u201cThe way it\u2019s used in the article seems in line with the standard dictionary definition, which I\u2019m sure is what was intended,\u201d he said. The public editor\u2019s take: I agree that the reporter was most likely following standard usage of the term \u201cglobalist.\u201d But if the word is being hijacked to imply something else \u2014 it\u2019s worth discussing whether that should have any effect on its usage.  Last weekend, the public editor addressed The Times\u2019s attempts, since the election, to better cover Trump country. One reader, following up this week, suggested updating The Times\u2019s \u201cWhat You Get\u201d column, which looks \u201cat the houses you can get for a given price around the United States.\u201d A quick count confirms Gliick\u2019s characterization: 16 of the past 20 prices have been at least $1 million; the lowest price was $700,000. We asked Vivian Toy, the Real Estate editor, to explain the reason for the regular price point. The public editor\u2019s take: As a subscriber to Architectural Digest, I appreciate the eye candy of paging through gorgeous houses. But I can see how $1 million homes could feel exclusionary to many readers, especially those off the pricey coasts. Surely there\u2019s an engaging way to feature more affordable homes from the rest of the country, at least occasionally. On a final note, the public editor\u2019s column last weekend also addressed reader concerns over the recent hiring of the conservative columnist Bret Stephens. Since his hiring was announced, our office has received over 700 emails raising concerns about statements he\u2019s made in past columns. Stephens told us he will be addressing some of these issues in his debut column this weekend.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/public-editor/friday-mailbag-please-dont-call-it-trumps-tax-plan.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Public Editor", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:28-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "created_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:28-04:00", "abstract": "The New York Times\u2019s use of tax terms prompts emails.
