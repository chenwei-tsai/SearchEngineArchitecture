{"text": "It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the beauty of spring flowers, but once you\u2019ve got them home, the vase can be just as important as the blossoms. \u201cIf you have the perfect vase, a couple of yellow dandelions actually look more incredible than a cheap vase with a white orchid,\u201d said Lewis Miller, an event and floral designer in New York, with clients like Firmdale Hotels and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. For that reason, Mr. Miller prefers distinctive vases to the generic glass cylinders sold in flower shops. At home, he said, \u201cI have containers that look great even if they don\u2019t have flowers. They\u2019re accessories that are always part of the room, not things that come out just when flowers arrive.\u201d He also doesn\u2019t hesitate to use unconventional containers. He and his staff have been known to stuff empty trash bins with monumental arrangements of leftover blossoms to create lavish \u201cflower flashes\u201d around Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s fun and it\u2019s free,\u201d he said. \u201cYou stand back and hear people say, \u2018Only in New York.\u2019\u201d \u2022 How many vases do you need for a dinner party? \u201cI almost always use multiples,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cA single thing in the middle of a dining table just feels so heavy.\u201d \u2022 How often are you willing to change the water? Mr. Miller generally prefers an opaque or translucent vase, he said, \u201cso after a couple of days it doesn\u2019t show that dirty flower water.\u201d \u2022 Do you need more than one size? \u201cI like different scales,\u201d Mr. Miller said. That way, \u201cyou have taller pieces to hold some flowering branches and then smaller pieces for a couple of stems in the bathroom.\u201d Cylindrical brass vases with colored enamel, in three sizes | $35 to $95 each at Hawkins New York: 844-469-3344 or hawkinsnewyork.com ____ Handmade porcelain vase adorned with cloud-like spheres | $1,260 at Klein Reid: 718-937-3828 or kleinreid.com ____ Set of four ceramic vases coated in rubber paint that can be nested or used separately | $139 at Design Public: 855-828-9327 or designpublic.com ____ Colored glass vases designed by Anderssen & Voll | $50 to $75 each at Menu: store.menudesignshop.com ____ Hand-cast multicolored, marbleized porcelain vases | $220 to $450 at Sarah Cihat: sarahcihat.com", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/realestate/shopping-for-vases.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T12:50:29-04:00", "abstract": "With the right vase, any flower \u2014 even a dandelion \u2014 can look good.", "title": "Shopping for Vases", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Real Estate", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T12:50:29-04:00"}
