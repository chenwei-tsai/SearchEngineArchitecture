{"text": "Last year, with fears about lead poisoning running high in the wake of the water crisis in Flint, Mich., New York City officials said that they had tested the water in all the city\u2019s public schools and that the results should be reassuring: Only 1 percent of outlets had lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s action level of 15 parts per billion. But after The New York Times reported that the city had run the water in every outlet for two hours the night before taking the water samples, a process called flushing, experts said that the practice had most likely hidden lead problems. They said the city should throw out the results and redo the tests. In the end, the city did. On Friday, the new results were released, and they paint a starkly different picture: This time, 8 percent of outlets had lead levels above 15 parts per billion. And the vast majority of school buildings \u2014 83 percent \u2014 had at least one outlet with a lead level above the threshold. The city had previously said that two-thirds of its roughly 1,500 school buildings had no outlets above the 15 parts per billion threshold. Flushing cleans most soluble lead and lead particles out of the pipes and thus reduces lead levels temporarily. Two schools in Queens were among the worst for the number of outlets involved. At Public School 95, the Eastwood School, in Jamaica, which has 1,500 students, 34 outlets had lead levels above the E.P.A. threshold. A water fountain in the cafeteria had a level of 3,200 parts per billion. Several other water fountains \u2014 in the cafeteria, a play area and a school hallway \u2014 had lead levels more than 40 times the E.P.A. action level. When the school was tested the first time, under the protocol that included the flushing, the highest level found was 35 parts per billion. At Public School/Intermediate School 208, in the Bellerose neighborhood, 36 outlets had lead levels above the threshold, including a classroom water fountain with a lead level of 1,740 parts per billion, and a faucet in a girls\u2019 bathroom with a lead level of 8,850 parts per billion. When the school, which has about 700 students, was tested the first time, the highest level found was 24 parts per billion. In recent months, schools have sent letters home and posted them on their websites informing parents about the tests and the levels found in individual outlets. In January, the state released a summary of results from tests of about a third of the city\u2019s school buildings. The city\u2019s Education Department said every outlet where a sample exceeded the threshold had been turned off and would be turned on again only after it was replaced and new tests found levels below 15 parts per billion. Additionally, all schools where tests found at least one sample above the threshold have been put on a protocol of flushing the water every Monday morning before school starts. New cases of lead poisoning among children in New York City have declined significantly in the past decade. The city\u2019s health department investigates cases of lead poisoning in children, and the Education Department said there had never been a known case of lead poisoning traced to drinking water in schools.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/new-york-schools-lead-water.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T20:13:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T20:13:05-04:00", "abstract": "In a second round of water testing, 83 percent of school buildings had at least one outlet with levels above the E.P.A.\u2019s threshold for action.", "title": "Most New York City Schools Had High Lead Levels, Retests Find"}
