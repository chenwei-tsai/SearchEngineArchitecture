{"text": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 The tight end is increasingly becoming a transformational position in the N.F.L. That is why the Jets considered selecting Alabama\u2019s O. J. Howard with the sixth overall pick Thursday in the first round of the N.F.L. draft. Howard came with the hope of landing the next Rob Gronkowski, the prototype for the modern tight end and someone who has tormented the Jets as a focal point on offense for the New England Patriots. Instead, the Jets selected Louisiana State safety Jamal Adams, who they hope can be a foil to Gronkowski. \u201cThere\u2019s so many guys out there that can split out and become a receiver, so the game has changed,\u201d Adams said Friday afternoon as he was introduced to the news media. \u201cYou don\u2019t see too many blocking tight ends, as we call it. You see actual route running \u2014 great routes \u2014 strong hands, physical, so you need a safety who can cover and take those guys away out of the game because they\u2019re a big portion when it comes to winning ballgames.\u201d Adams cited Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen \u2014 who has amassed 1,000 receiving yards in each of the past three seasons \u2014 as well as Howard, and the Giants\u2019 first-round pick, Evan Engram, as prime examples of such players. But Adams reserved his highest praise for Gronkowski, whom he will face at least twice a year with the Jets. Their first meeting will be Oct. 15 at MetLife Stadium. Asked if he had lined up against anyone comparable in college, Adams could not find a name, calling Gronkowski \u201ca legend.\u201d \u201cAs soon as I got drafted, that was one of the first people I thought about, him, as well as, you know, the GOAT, Tom Brady,\u201d Adams said, using an acronym for \u201cgreatest of all time.\u201d \u201cTremendous respect for those guys, that organization.\u201d The Jets surely hope Adams\u2019s worth will be proven in more than just games against the Patriots. On Thursday, shortly after the Jets picked Adams, Coach Todd Bowles described him as an \u201calpha dog\u201d and someone who could immediately be a team leader as the Jets rebuild from a 5-11 record in 2016. Adams said he felt natural in a leadership role since he had begun playing football. Assessing his on-field skills, he described his versatility on defense similarly to how he lauded the dynamic ability of today\u2019s tight ends \u2014 bringing experience playing free safety and strong safety and the ability to make calls in presnap coverage, and covering speedy receivers man to man in the slot. Adams made it sound as if a safety could have an impact just like a tight end such as Gronkowski. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m average,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI don\u2019t ever try to be average. I always try to be above and beyond in whatever I do.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/football/jets-draft-second-third-round.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T20:50:47-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T20:50:47-04:00", "abstract": "Adams, whom Coach Todd Bowles described as an \u201calpha dog,\u201d praised Ron Gronkowski of the Patriots, someone whom Adams will soon be lining up against on the field.", "title": "New Jets Safety Jamal Adams, Praising Tight Ends, Plans to Thwart Them"}
