{"text": "For a second week in a row, the Billboard album chart is all about Kendrick Lamar. Mr. Lamar\u2019s new album, \u201cDAMN.\u201d (Interscope), holds at No. 1 for a second week, with 87,000 copies sold and 204 million streams in the United States, according to Nielsen. Those numbers helped give it the equivalent of 238,000 album sales, according to Nielsen and Billboard\u2019s chart formulas, and put Mr. Lamar\u2019s album far above anything else on the chart. Drake, the king of streaming hip-hop, had 97 million streams for the songs on his latest playlist, \u201cMore Life\u201d (Republic), which came out six weeks ago and lands this week at No. 2. But the album\u2019s tiny sales quotient \u2014 the full collection sold just less than 6,000 copies \u2014 contributed to a low total equivalent number of 77,000. Also this week, Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201c\u00f7\u201d (Atlantic) is No. 3; the rock band Incubus opened at No. 4 with its new album, \u201c8\u201d (Island); and Bruno Mars is in fifth place with \u201c24K Magic\u201d (Atlantic), now in its 23rd week on the chart.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-damn-billboard-chart.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T14:37:08-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T14:37:08-04:00", "abstract": "The rapper\u2019s latest album dominated the Top 200, with a total that dwarfed Drake\u2019s \u201cMore Life\u201d playlist, which came in No. 2.", "title": "Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u2018DAMN.\u2019 Spends a Second Week at No. 1"}
