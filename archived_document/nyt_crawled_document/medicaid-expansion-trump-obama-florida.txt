{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration appears to have scrapped one of the key tools the Obama administration used to encourage states to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The shift involves funding that the federal government provides to help hospitals defray the cost of caring for low-income people who are uninsured. Under a deal with the State of Florida, the federal government has tentatively agreed to provide additional money for the state\u2019s \u201clow-income pool,\u201d a reversal of the previous administration\u2019s policy. The Obama administration balked at providing more money to hospitals for such \u201cuncompensated care,\u201d saying that if Florida expanded Medicaid eligibility, fewer people would be uninsured and hospitals would have less uncompensated care. Under the Obama administration, the amount of the Florida low-income pool fell to $608 million a year, from $1 billion. Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who had pushed for years to bolster the state\u2019s low-income pool, and the Trump administration recently announced that the pool would grow to $1.5 billion a year. Mr. Scott welcomed the tentative agreement as one of the first examples of the new freedom and flexibility promised to states by the Trump administration. \u201cFlorida was on the front line of fighting against federal overreach under President Obama,\u201d he said, \u201cand it is refreshing to now have a federal government that treats us fairly and does not attempt to coerce us into expanding Medicaid.\u201d Trump administration officials say that the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act was not a good use of taxpayer dollars and that there are better ways to provide health care for low-income people. But former Obama administration officials said the Trump administration\u2019s change on low-income pools was misguided. \u201cFlorida is just being paid by taxpayers not to expand Medicaid,\u201d said Andrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from March 2015 to January of this year. \u201cThe low-income pool is essentially a slush fund,\u201d Mr. Slavitt said, \u201cand it\u2019s a really inefficient way to pay for medical care.\u201d Jessica Schubel, who worked at the Medicaid agency under President Barack Obama, said the action planned by the Trump administration was \u201ca sharp departure from principles that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u201d had been following. In a letter to Florida\u2019s top Medicaid official in May 2015, the Obama administration said: \u201cCoverage is the best way to secure affordable access to health care for low-income individuals. Uncompensated care pool funding should not pay for costs that would be paid for in a Medicaid expansion.\u201d Florida is one of 19 states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. In a report last week, the Urban Institute estimated that 730,000 to 900,000 people would gain coverage if Florida expanded Medicaid. Of the 20 million people insured as a result of the Affordable Care Act, more than half have gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid. The Trump administration supports a House Republican bill that would repeal major provisions of the 2010 health law and eliminate funds for the expansion of Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the House repeal bill would reduce Medicaid spending by $839 billion in the coming decade, compared with the amount that would be spent under current law. Fourteen million fewer people would be covered by Medicaid, the office says. Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, has asserted that Medicaid has \u201creal problems,\u201d saying that, for instance, one-third of doctors in the United States do not take Medicaid patients. At a recent town hall forum on CNN, Mr. Price was confronted by a cancer survivor who said he was alive because of the expansion of Medicaid. Mr. Price said the man\u2019s experience was \u201cnot necessarily true for everybody.\u201d Brian Blase, a special assistant to President Trump for health care policy, has cataloged the Medicaid problems in several recent essays. In states that expanded Medicaid, he said, enrollment substantially exceeds expectations, and spending for the new beneficiaries is \u201csignificantly above projections.\u201d \u201cExpanding Medicaid was an unwise policy decision made by the drafters of the A.C.A.,\u201d Mr. Blase wrote in Forbes in November. \u201cThe program needed reform, not expansion.\u201d Medicaid covers care for low-income people. The federal government and states have historically shared the costs, with the federal share averaging 57 percent. But the federal government pays a much larger share \u2014 at least 90 percent of the costs \u2014 for adults who qualify for Medicaid because of the expansion of eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration has not formally announced a new policy on Medicaid, but the change is evident in the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of the agreement it is negotiating with Florida. The top Democrats on the congressional committees responsible for Medicaid, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, have expressed concern about the deal with Florida, which is envisioned as part of a Medicaid waiver. It is not clear how the waiver would \u201cpromote the objectives\u201d of the Medicaid program, as required by federal law, they said in a letter to Seema Verma, the new administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Two House Democrats from Florida, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Kathy Castor, said that after receiving the commitment of federal funds, the Florida Legislature was now moving to adopt a budget that includes cuts in state Medicaid spending. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageously irresponsible,\u201d Ms. Wasserman Schultz said. Ms. Castor said that \u201cit would be more efficient to expand Medicaid so people would have coverage, rather than running up huge bills at hospitals that need to seek reimbursement from the low-income pool.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/politics/medicaid-expansion-trump-obama-florida.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T14:28:17-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T14:15:38-04:00", "abstract": "The shift involves funding that the federal government provides to help hospitals defray the cost of caring for low-income people who are uninsured.", "title": "Florida Deal Would Reverse Key Part of Obama\u2019s Medicaid Expansion"}
