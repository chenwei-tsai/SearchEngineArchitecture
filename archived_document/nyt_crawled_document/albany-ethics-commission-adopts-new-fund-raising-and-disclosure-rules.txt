But on Tuesday, at least, the commission seemed to become a hotbed of action, adopting a pair of advisory opinions intended to tighten fund-raising restrictions for New York\u2019s highest-ranking elected officials, and widening disclosure requirements for public-relations consultants, including for activities like soliciting editorials from news organizations. The votes on Tuesday came even as state lawmakers and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo continued to debate additional ethics laws in the wake of the criminal convictions of Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan who had served as speaker of the State Assembly, and Dean G. Skelos, a Republican from Long Island who was the leader of the State Senate. Both men are awaiting sentencing on federal corruption charges. The change in fund-raising rules had been under consideration for several months by the commission, which is generally known as Jcope and is responsible for investigating violations of state ethics and lobbying laws. In its opinion, the commission held that no statewide elected official, including the comptroller or the attorney general, should be allowed to accept or solicit campaign contributions from any person or group that is under investigation or embroiled in a legal battle with its offices. The change had been publicly opposed by both current occupants of those offices: the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, and the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, both Democrats. In a Jan. 22 letter to the commission, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office called the opinion \u201cfundamentally unfair and uneven in its application,\u201d noting that only the comptroller and the attorney general, who investigate scores of groups and people every year, \u201cwould be monitored, investigated and possibly subject to enforcement actions by Jcope.\u201d (The governor\u2019s office, which declined to comment on the opinion, does not conduct investigations, though some executive branch agencies do.) Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office also cited a series of perceived practical problems, arguing that the opinion would effectively require government officials and campaigns to coordinate in a way that \u201cis likely to contribute to, not dispel, the appearance of improper influence,\u201d including asking governmental staff to review campaign contributions to see if their donors are being investigated. Perhaps with such concerns in mind, the opinion adopted by the commission on Tuesday was modified to ban contributions only from donors who were the subject of active investigations, in which \u201cthe elected official, or the official\u2019s immediate state staff, are personally and substantially involved\u201d in the inquiry. Both the attorney general\u2019s office and the comptroller\u2019s office declined to comment on the fund-raising decision, which passed unanimously. Reaction to the commission\u2019s other opinion was more heated, particularly to a proposed passage that would require public relations consultants who spoke to reporters to file bimonthly lobbying reports with Jcope if such activities were meant to \u201cget the media outlet to advance the client\u2019s message.\u201d That rule was included along with several others that expand the definition of lobbying, under the state\u2019s Lobbying Act, to include a requirement that would encompass so-called door opening introductions to public officials made by consultants. The idea of monitoring contacts with journalists, even in loose ways, prompted a furious reaction from public relations professionals, who said that such disclosure would have a chilling effect on both their First Amendment rights and journalists\u2019 ability to report the news. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office \u2014 which names six of the commission\u2019s 14 members \u2014 noted that the opinion \u201craises some real questions.\u201d The commission appeared willing to compromise, noting the fact that such disclosure would apply only to consultants who were seeking to influence editorials. The opinion was adopted with a disclaimer saying it was \u201cin no way intended to restrict a reporter\u2019s ability to gather information or to seek comment from representatives of advocacy groups as part of reporting the news.\u201d \u201cRather,\u201d the disclaimer continued, \u201cthis is intended to generate transparency in the activities of paid media consultants.\u201d As modified, the rule passed 10 to 3. Still, its opponents said Jcope, so often faulted for not doing enough, had gone too far. \u201cIt makes no difference if we\u2019re talking about edit boards or newsrooms,\u201d said Jerry McKinstry, the managing director of the November Team, a firm that threatened not to abide by the new rule, calling it \u201cclassic government overreach\u201d and \u201ctotally misguided.\u201d \u201cLast I checked, editorial board members were journalists, too,\u201d Mr. McKinstry said.", "item_type": "Article"}
