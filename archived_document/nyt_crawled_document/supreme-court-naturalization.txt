Roberts Jr. tried to test the limits of the government\u2019s position at a Supreme Court argument on Wednesday by confessing to a criminal offense. \u201cSome time ago, outside the statute of limitations, I drove 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile-an-hour zone,\u201d the chief justice said, adding that he had not been caught. The form that people seeking American citizenship must complete, he added, asks whether the applicant had ever committed a criminal offense, however minor, even if there was no arrest. \u201cIf I answer that question no, 20 years after I was naturalized as a citizen, you can knock on my door and say, \u2018Guess what, you\u2019re not an American citizen after all\u2019?\u201d Chief Justice Roberts asked. Robert A. Parker, a Justice Department lawyer, said the offense had to be disclosed. Chief Justice Roberts seemed shocked. \u201cOh, come on,\u201d he said. The chief justice asked again whether someone\u2019s citizenship could turn on such an omission. Mr. Parker did not back down. \u201cIf we can prove that you deliberately lied in answering that question, then yes,\u201d he said. The exchange was among several moments of indignation and incredulity during the argument in Maslenjak v. United States, No. 16-309. Several justices seemed taken aback by Mr. Parker\u2019s unyielding position that the government may revoke the citizenship of Americans who made even trivial misstatements in their naturalization proceedings. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy had heard enough. \u201cYour argument is demeaning the priceless value of citizenship,\u201d he told Mr. Parker. \u201cYou\u2019re arguing for the government of the United States, talking about what citizenship is and ought to mean.\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked about the failure to disclose an embarrassing childhood nickname. Justice Elena Kagan said she was a \u201clittle bit horrified to know that every time I lie about my weight it has those kinds of consequences.\u201d Mr. Parker said the law applied to all false statements, even trivial ones. Justice Stephen G. Breyer said it was \u201crather surprising that the government of the United States thinks\u201d that the naturalization laws should be \u201cinterpreted in a way that would throw into doubt the citizenship of vast percentages of all naturalized citizens.\u201d Chief Justice Roberts added that the government\u2019s position would give prosecutors extraordinary power. \u201cIf you take the position that not answering about the speeding ticket or the nickname is enough to subject that person to denaturalization,\u201d he said, \u201cthe government will have the opportunity to denaturalize anyone they want.\u201d The Trump administration has sought to strip the citizenship of a convicted terrorist, and President Trump has said that loss of citizenship may be a fit punishment for burning the American flag. Wednesday\u2019s case concerned Divna Maslenjak, an ethnic Serb who said she had faced persecution in Bosnia. She was granted refugee status at least partly on that basis in 1999 and became a United States citizen in 2007. Along the way, she apparently lied about her husband, saying she and her family had also feared retributions because he had avoided conscription by the Bosnian Serb military. In fact, he had served in a Bosnian Serb military unit, one that had been implicated in war crimes. When this came to light, Ms. Maslenjak was charged with obtaining her citizenship illegally. She sought to argue that her lie was immaterial, but the trial judge told the jury that any lie, significant or not, was enough. Ms. Maslenjak was convicted, her citizenship was ordered revoked, and she and her husband were deported to Serbia. Christopher Landau, a lawyer for Ms. Maslenjak said that the trial judge had applied the wrong standard and that she was entitled to be tried under the right one. Much of the argument was concerned with what sort of causal relationship the government had to prove between the lie and the grant of citizenship. Justice Kagan asked Mr. Parker, the government lawyer, subtle questions to tease out his position. Then Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg offered her own approach. \u201cThis may be a simple-minded question,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said, \u201cbut how can an immaterial statement procure naturalization?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s such a shorter statement of my question,\u201d Justice Kagan said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d", "title": "Justices Alarmed by Government\u2019s Hard-Line Stance in Citizenship Case", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T18:10:34-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/supreme-court-naturalization.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00"}
