{"text": "AUBURN, Ala. \u2014 He ended up as the eulogist at Harper Lee\u2019s funeral last year, but the Alabama historian and author Wayne Flynt did not exactly get along with the novelist when they first met in 1983 in the small lake town of Eufaula, Ala. He asked her to sign his copy of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d \u201cShe said, \u2018No, I only sign for children,\u2019\u201d Mr. Flynt said, laughing, in an interview here. \u201cI thought, you are really discourteous. Essentially, you\u2019re just like all the stuff I\u2019ve read about you.\u201d But over the next 25 years, Mr. Flynt, 76, a professor emeritus of history at Auburn University, said he became close with the famously reclusive Ms. Lee. His new book, \u201cMockingbird Songs: My Friendship With Harper Lee,\u201d is based on their relationship, on his takeaways from visits to the nursing home where she lived in her last years and from letters she sent that give a full sense of a personality that was one of the great literary enigmas of the last half-century. In one, from March 2006, she declared Truman Capote \u2014 her childhood friend and literary rival \u2014 a liar. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you understood this about him,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut his compulsive lying was like this: if you said, \u2018Did you know JFK was shot?\u2019 He\u2019d easily answer, \u2018Yes, I was driving the car he was riding in.\u2019\u201d Ms. Lee wrote that Mr. Capote\u2019s drinking and misery soured their friendship. Jealousy ended it. \u201cI was his oldest friend, and I did something Truman could not forgive: I wrote a novel that sold,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe nursed his envy for more than 20 years.\u201d The book, due out May 2, provides a rare glimpse behind the curtain that Ms. Lee drew around herself after the sudden success of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d propelled her onto the public stage. The novel about racial injustice in the 1930s has sold more than 40 million copies, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and created a firestorm of interest about her that ultimately drove Ms. Lee to retire from public life. She stopped giving interviews in the 1960s and told Mr. Flynt that she typically vomited before speaking engagements \u2014 so much so that she came up with a little pep talk, \u201ca mantra of great egotism,\u201d to help alleviate the pressure. It went, according to a letter from 2006: \u201cI\u2019m older than anybody here, I know more than anybody here, so why should I be so afraid of anybody here?\u201d \u201cIt works for about 15 minutes,\u201d she confided. Mr. Flynt and his wife, Dartie, were among the few people who remained part of Ms. Lee\u2019s inner circle as it shrank in the years preceding her death at 89 \u2014 their friendship born, Mr. Flynt said, from similar senses of humor and a shared love for Alabama history. Ms. Lee told Mr. Flynt she did not want him to write about her while she was alive. But she said nothing, he said, about his writing about her after she died. \u201cThis allows her to speak beyond the grave and without any risk to her privacy,\u201d he said. At least two other books about Ms. Lee are planned in coming years. The New Yorker magazine writer Casey Cep will explore Ms. Lee\u2019s unfinished crime novel in a book for Alfred A. Knopf next year. Ms. Lee\u2019s family is also searching for a biographer because relatives say they are displeased with Charles J. Shields\u2019 2006 unauthorized book about her. That makes for at least six books from major publishers about a woman who wrote only two. The Shields biography, \u201cMockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee,\u201d a best seller, was well received. Garrison Keillor, in his Times review, described Mr. Shields as \u201ca scrupulous journalist who respects the lady\u2019s privacy even as he opens up her life.\u201d Ms. Lee was not so taken with it. In one letter, dated March 28, 2006, she said the book traveled the path from \u201cfiction to nonsense,\u201d and she labeled Mr. Shields a \u201ccreep.\u201d \u201cI know she herself hated it,\u201d said Claudia Durst Johnson, an author, scholar and friend of Ms. Lee\u2019s. \u201cShe thought it was poorly written.\u201d Mr. Shields has said that he believes Harper Lee and her sister Alice were particularly upset by a description of their mother, Frances Finch Lee, as manic depressive. Hank Conner, the sisters\u2019 nephew, said, \u201cI think he said some things about my grandmother that weren\u2019t true.\u201d Mr. Shields has said he tried to be discreet in mentioning Frances Finch Lee\u2019s mental health, but said he felt it needed to be addressed. Ms. Lee was a prolific letter writer. Her writings to Mr. Flynt often ran a dozen pages in a slanted, if sloppy, cursive. In them, her love for Manhattan is apparent. She kept an apartment there from 1949 until she suffered a stroke in 2007 that sent her home to Alabama. New York was a refuge for Ms. Lee, who liked to attend Mets games, Broadway shows and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. If she died in New York, she wrote, she wanted her ashes scattered above Manhattan \u201cwithout ceremony.\u201d Ms. Lee\u2019s letters are peppered with self-deprecating jokes about the macular degeneration that in recent years had damaged her eyesight \u2014 \u201cBlind is now a no-no word, like sin\u201d \u2014 and about her bout with fame. It wasn\u2019t just the klieg lights of celebrity that worried her, but the darker impulses sometimes provoked by stardom. She described, Mr. Flynt said, one close encounter with a stalker who followed her from Birmingham to her home in Monroeville. That only cemented her fear for her safety, he said. \u201cShe was obsessed with the idea of stalkers and assassination,\u201d Mr. Flynt said. \u201cShe was really afraid of being killed for the sake of someone else\u2019s neuroses.\u201d Though she kept the public at a distance, Mr. Flynt said Ms. Lee was loyal to friends and family, caring for her brother, father and literary agent Maurice Crain at the end of their lives. \u201cShe was incredibly empathetic, and that\u2019s a part of her life people don\u2019t understand,\u201d Mr. Flynt said. Ms. Lee praised her sister Alice, who died in 2014, as, \u201cthe most remarkable person I ever knew.\u201d \u201cShe keeps me out of the federal pen,\u201d she wrote. Mr. Flynt described Ms. Lee as a Christian realist who was not sentimental about religion and enjoyed reading the apologist C.S. Lewis. A book of his complete works lay on her ottoman when she died, Mr. Flynt said. In her letters, Ms. Lee often mentioned books and writers. She praised a host of authors, from Frank McCourt to William Faulkner. She referred to Eudora Welty as \u201cmy goddess.\u201d As for her own work, Ms. Lee said she was content with \u201cMockingbird,\u201d though, despite its popularity, she saw its shortcomings. \u201cI wonder what their reaction would have been if TKAM had been complex, sour, unsentimental, racially unpaternalistic because Atticus was a bastard,\u201d she wrote to Mr. Flynt on July 31, 2006. He didn\u2019t know it then, but she actually had written such a book. It was called \u201cGo Set a Watchman,\u201d and it depicted Atticus as a racist, not a hero, and it had been a first draft that was ultimately rewritten and became \u201cMockingbird.\u201d \u201cWatchman\u201d resurfaced and was published in 2015 amid concerns that Ms. Lee, old and infirm, may not have fully participated in the decision to publish a long forgotten and flawed first novel (which has now sold more than three million copies, according to HarperCollins). But Mr. Flynt was adamant at the time that she had welcomed the publication. Now, looking back, Ms. Lee\u2019s 2006 letter to him gives us some sense of just why.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/in-harper-lees-letters-books-fame-and-a-lying-capote.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:13-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:13-04:00", "abstract": "Wayne Flynt, a friend of Ms. Lee, has written a book, \u201cMockingbird Songs,\u201d in which he shares thoughts and correspondence regarding the literary enigma.", "title": "In Harper Lee\u2019s Letters: Books, Fame and a \u2018Lying\u2019 Capote"}
