{"text": "BERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 In explaining why it had canceled a speech by Ann Coulter scheduled for next week, the University of California, Berkeley, said that it had \u201cvery specific intelligence\u201d that Ms. Coulter might be in \u201cgrave danger.\u201d To Ms. Coulter and her supporters, it was another example of Berkeley showing intolerance of any opinions other than the liberal ones it is famous for. But the university that championed free expression in the 1960s has become known, in the polarizing first months of the Trump presidency, as something more: a meeting ground for those wanting to express themselves with wooden clubs and fists. Just a few days after fights broke out between anarchists and right-wing groups near campus, and a couple of months after masked protesters smashed windows and set fires in a successful attempt to stop a speech by the incendiary right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos, the police are preparing for the possibility of another round of violence if Ms. Coulter follows through on her vow to show up anyway on Thursday. \u201cThe city and campus have become the stage on which the national political tensions are playing out,\u201d said Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university. \u201cComing here, they know they will be able to find an opponent pretty easily.\u201d Berkeley now finds itself bracing, essentially, for two battles. One is with Ms. Coulter and the groups bringing her to campus, the Young America\u2019s Foundation and the university\u2019s College Republicans. The groups have threatened to sue the university, saying its offer to allow Ms. Coulter to speak the next week, and in the early afternoon, when fewer students will be around to hear her, \u201cviolate fundamental principles of free speech, equal protection and due process guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and will not be tolerated.\u201d The other is a potential physical confrontation. Leftist activists on and off campus, including a loosely organized group calling itself Antifa, for \u201canti-fascist,\u201d are threatening to do anything they can to block Ms. Coulter from speaking. Right-wing supporters are gathering support on Facebook, making plans to come to the campus to defend her. \u201cOur basic thing is to send a loud and clear message that this is not acceptable on our campus,\u201d said Hoku Jeffrey, a Berkeley graduate and national organizer for By Any Means Necessary, a group that took part in previous demonstrations that turned violent. \u201cWe will not tolerate anti-immigrant bigotry or bigotry of any kind, which is the only thing she\u2019s here to do.\u201d On Sean Hannity\u2019s show on Thursday night on Fox News, Ms. Coulter, never one to let a pot go unstirred, mocked her liberal protesters as \u201cbeta males\u201d engaging in \u201cRodney King riots.\u201d Meanwhile, Johnny Benitez of Orange County, in Southern California, said he was organizing a group of conservatives to show up in Berkeley. He was part of a group that showed up last weekend for the demonstrations in Berkeley that ultimately led to 20 arrests. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a connection to Berkeley,\u201d said Mr. Benitez, 28. \u201cThe reason we go there is to support people who feel that their First Amendment rights are being infringed, our fellow conservatives in the city of Berkeley. The people I\u2019m mostly organizing are coming from six hours away.\u201d He said they would try to arrive at 10 a.m. Thursday \u201cbecause traffic can hold you back, we can get some lunch and a big part of it is trying to stay together.\u201d Mr. Benitez said that his group would arrive unarmed, as they did last weekend. But in recent confrontations, demonstrators have turned rocks, fireworks and police barricades into weapons \u2014 even using a bike lock to wallop someone in the head. \u201cThe way that they assemble, the tactics that they used, it has not been seen in this region,\u201d said Capt. Alex Yao, the acting chief of the university police force, at a briefing on Thursday. Some colleges and universities, like Berkeley, have asked that speakers likely to draw protests appear in the afternoon, when crowds are more controllable than in the evening. Mr. Mogulof, the university spokesman, said Friday that the university was within its rights in setting a day, time and venue that would be \u201csafe for participants.\u201d \u201cWe are confident that we are on very solid legal grounds,\u201d Mr. Mogulof said in an email. \u201cThe constitution permits the university to take such steps to protect public safety while facilitating expressive activities, and that is exactly what we are doing.\u201d Peaceful activism remains a hallmark of the university. On Thursday, students representing the International Socialist Organization handed out fliers for May Day demonstrations amid a half-dozen other booths by organizations trying to lure students to support their causes. At the same time, Berkeley\u2019s reputation as a campus fully engaged in the divisive politics of the day is in some ways at odds with the desire of many students to study, enjoy college life and get a degree from one of the country\u2019s premier public universities. On Thursday, as university officials strategized on how to handle Ms. Coulter\u2019s demands, thousands of students lounged on a lawn outside a library building and smoked pot in celebration of April 20, a kind of national holiday for marijuana lovers. \u201cAnn Coulter? What are you talking about?\u201d a woman selling doughnuts as a fund-raiser for her sorority told a reporter. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that at all.\u201d Isaac Meyer, a nuclear engineering student from Bakersfield, Calif., said that while he knew the bare outlines of the Coulter controversy, \u201cmost people don\u2019t have the mental energy to be upset about it.\u201d Mr. Meyer, a senior, said that he had taken part in Black Lives Matter protests and that many students attended a women\u2019s march on Jan. 21. But he said he had no interest in attending the recent protests that turned violent. \u201cMost of the people I know, when we find out about a protest like that, we think, \u2018Oh, well, we can\u2019t walk to that part of campus today,\u2019\u201d he said. And some veterans of the Free Speech Movement of the \u201960s, a seminal moment in the university\u2019s history, are disheartened that Berkeley is now associated with violence and blocking speech instead of promoting it. \u201cI don\u2019t think Ann Coulter has anything useful to say, but it was unconstitutional for the university to bar her from speaking,\u201d said Lynne Hollander Savio, who took part in the movement and is the widow of Mario Savio, its leading spokesman. Ms. Savio sees a clear generational divide. Free speech, she said, was more of an absolute for her husband, who is commemorated outside Sproul Hall at the heart of the campus by the officially designated Mario Savio Steps. \u201cMario took a principled position \u2014 it was free speech for all,\u201d she said. \u201cI think free speech has slipped as a value.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/us/berkeley-ann-coulter-speech.html", "published_date": "2017-04-20T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T16:30:06-04:00", "abstract": "The university that championed free speech in the 1960s has become known as a meeting ground for those wanting to express themselves with wooden clubs and fists.", "title": "Berkeley Is Being Tested on 2 Fronts: Free Speech and Safety", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "U.S.", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T16:30:06-04:00"}
