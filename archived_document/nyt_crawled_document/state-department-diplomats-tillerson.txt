{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The stampede of diners who once rushed through the State Department\u2019s vast cafeteria has ebbed, with diplomats who previously grabbed quick bites between meetings now lingering over Korean barbecue and checking their phones for some kind of news. Many have little to do until the Trump administration starts filling the nearly 200 jobs at the department that require Senate confirmation, and their agendas look increasingly as though they will remain empty. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has done almost nothing to select leaders for the White House\u2019s consideration, and nominations for assistant secretaries and others who largely run the State Department are unlikely to be made for months. In an unusual interview, R. C. Hammond, Mr. Tillerson\u2019s spokesman, said the secretary intended to embark within days on a listening tour of the building and then a restructuring of the department\u2019s operations. Only after those are underway will he begin to name his wider leadership team. With a Senate confirmation process that takes months, that means the department will remain largely leaderless until well into 2018. And no other department in the federal government is as dependent on political appointees, or as paralyzed when the appointment process freezes. State Department veterans reacted to Mr. Tillerson\u2019s timetable with incredulity. \u201cThere is a crisis with North Korea now, at a time neither State nor Defense have the bench of senior leaders needed, and with State facing a massive budget cut,\u201d said Wendy R. Sherman, a top diplomat in the Obama administration. \u201cHow do you execute a policy with the quality you need in that circumstance?\u201d Fill-in leaders, like those who are conducting diplomacy in the absence of political appointees, do not always instill confidence in foreign governments, said Siddharth Mohandas, another Obama administration diplomat. \u201cPeople abroad are looking to see that the president\u2019s own people are in place and can speak to the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d Mr. Mohandas said. But Mr. Hammond said there was no sense nominating people for jobs that might be eliminated in a restructuring. The Trump administration has proposed cutting the department\u2019s budget by 31 percent, and while the Senate is unlikely to approve such a drastic cut, some reduction is likely. \u201cThe first step was to find out where the Titanic was, and then it was to map out where everything else is,\u201d Mr. Hammond said, likening the department\u2019s organizational structure to a sunken ocean liner and its seabed surroundings. \u201cI think we\u2019re still in the process of mapping out the entire ocean floor so that we understand the full picture.\u201d The listening tour will enable Mr. Tillerson to hear from diplomats on how to reorganize and refocus, Mr. Hammond said. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll see us do over the next several months is start to ask the question, ask people to contribute their vision of what they think the big mission is,\u201d he said. \u201cNot until that part is accomplished can we even begin to think about how to restructure anything.\u201d In the meantime, career Foreign Service officers \u201care operating very much at the varsity level\u201d in posts usually reserved for political appointees, Mr. Hammond said. Besides, he added, Mr. Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil with no prior diplomatic or political experience, wants capable managers, not political cronies. \u201cIt\u2019s the distinction between politics and management, and between political motivation and motivating people,\u201d Mr. Hammond said. Whether Mr. Tillerson will be able to stick to his timeline is unclear. Nominations have begun to trickle in for other departments, and even Republicans sympathetic to him have begun to express alarm at his delays. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can sit around too long,\u201d said James J. Carafano, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a member of the Trump transition team. \u201cThe clock is ticking.\u201d While an unusually difficult White House vetting process has slowed appointees elsewhere in the administration, that is not the problem at the State Department. Mr. Tillerson has done little beyond proposing a lone deputy and acceding to a handful of ambassadorial nominations by the White House. Whatever the future \u2014 even if it involves drastic reductions \u2014 there is a near-universal wish among State Department employees for Mr. Tillerson to lead them to it, and soon. The wait is taking a toll. \u201cWith very little guidance coming from the secretary\u2019s office, rumors of draconian cuts abound, and many dedicated and extremely knowledgeable civil servants are electing to leave,\u201d said Robert G. Berschinski, a top Obama administration diplomat. Elliott Abrams, a neoconservative whom President Trump rejected as Mr. Tillerson\u2019s pick for a deputy, said delays in appointing new leaders meant that career diplomats \u2014 most of whom lean ideologically toward the Democratic Party, he said \u2014 might remain in charge for nearly a quarter of the president\u2019s term. \u201cThe Republican Party won the election, and Republicans should be in charge,\u201d he said. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s principal challenge, of course, is serving a mercurial president whose ideas on foreign policy are short on substance. The first months of the Trump administration have featured such breathtaking strategic reversals that paralysis at the State Department was arguably better than having diplomats charge off in one direction only to reverse course weeks later. But Mr. Tillerson has also been plagued by a series of embarrassing missteps and hour-by-hour tactical turnarounds that a trusted team might have prevented. He declared President Bashar al-Assad of Syria an enduring presence only to contradict himself within days, publicly disagreed with South Korea over whether he had been invited to dinner, and noted cryptically that Iran was complying with a landmark nuclear accord only to declare hours later that the deal had failed. Most secretaries of state spend their transition periods plotting structural changes, but the Trump transition was bare-bones, and Mr. Tillerson was unusually cloistered \u2014 never meeting with his predecessor, John Kerry, for instance. After his chief duty of \u201chelping the president develop his foreign policy positions,\u201d Mr. Tillerson\u2019s next steps, Mr. Hammond said, were \u201ctouching gloves with our allies and partners around the world\u201d \u2014 including in Europe, Japan, South Korea and Mexico \u2014 and hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from countries fighting the Islamic State. Third, Mr. Tillerson has been helping to carry out new administration positions on the crucial issues of the day, including North Korea, the NATO alliance, the Iran nuclear deal and China, Mr. Hammond said. And finally, he has begun to focus on the department\u2019s budget, which Congress is expected to approve by September, Mr. Hammond noted. But Mr. Hammond\u2019s explanation suggested that Mr. Tillerson was moving through issues one by one, without delegating, which could hamstring the department in an environment where multiple events often unfold simultaneously and develop quickly. Leaders in Congress said they were eager to hear Mr. Tillerson\u2019s restructuring plans. \u201cWe look forward to what it is he brings forth relative to streamlining,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Abrams said that several models were possible for restructuring the department, but that speed was preferable to perfection. \u201cThe quicker they do it, the better,\u201d he said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/state-department-diplomats-tillerson.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:34-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:34-04:00", "abstract": "Secretary of State Rex W.
