{"text": "Q. For a decade, my pet Chihuahua has lived with me in my rent-stabilized apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. In January, the building\u2019s new owners began eviction proceedings against me, on the grounds that owning a pet violated my lease. But I\u2019ve noticed that listings for newly renovated units advertise the building as pet-friendly. I suspect the eviction suit is harassment (I\u2019m head of the tenants\u2019 association). Does my landlord have grounds to evict me, and can he have different rules for different tenants?  A. Under New York City rules, if a tenant has openly owned a pet for three months and the landlord or management knew about it or should have known about it, the landlord waives the right to evict the pooch or the tenant. Assuming your Chihuahua has lived openly with you for all this time, that rule should apply. But you have an even stronger case: Under state law, there is a six-year statute of limitations for bringing a claim for a breach of contract, and a lease is considered a contract. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to show that your landlord knew or should have known\u201d about the pet, said Darryl M. Vernon, a real estate lawyer who represents people with companion animals. You might even be able to adopt another pet, because \u201cthe clause is now unenforceable forever,\u201d Mr. Vernon said. (The city\u2019s rule, however, applies only to your current dog.) Even so, you are not out of the woods. An eviction proceeding is serious. You should get a lawyer to represent you, if you can afford one. Avoid corresponding with your landlord without seeking legal advice. \u201cSometimes people write back things that can hurt their rights,\u201d Mr. Vernon said. In the meantime, collect evidence that shows how long you have owned your Chihuahua, like veterinarian bills or proof of adoption. As for your new neighbors, your landlord can give pet-friendly leases to some tenants and not others. The landlord might tolerate pets in market-rate apartments because those apartments tend to be much more expensive, and so the more perks he can offer, the more likely it is he\u2019ll be able to draw high-paying tenants.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/realestate/a-selective-no-pets-policy.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Real Estate", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T10:00:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Question", "created_date": "2017-04-29T10:00:05-04:00", "abstract": "Can my landlord evict me for having a dog while advertising newly renovated apartments in the building as pet-friendly?", "title": "A Selective \u2018No Pets\u2019 Policy"}
