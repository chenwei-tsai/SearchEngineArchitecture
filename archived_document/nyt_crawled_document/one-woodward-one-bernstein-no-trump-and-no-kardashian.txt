{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s decision to skip the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner on Saturday is one of the few good turns he has done for the Washington press corps since he arrived. Mr. Trump says he\u2019ll spend his 100th day as president at a \u201ccampaign\u201d rally in Harrisburg, Pa., rather than with journalists he has accused of mistreating him. It\u2019s the first time a president hasn\u2019t attended the annual event since 1981, when Ronald Reagan was recovering from an assassination attempt. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, said White House staff members won\u2019t attend, either, \u201cin solidarity,\u201d applying Gdansk Shipyard imagery to his refusal to eat free food in a celebrity mosh pit. White House reporters \u2014 rare as unicorns in the V.I.P.-heavy crowd of 3,000 \u2014 should be grateful. Without Mr. Trump\u2019s oxygen-sucking presence, the dinner stands the best chance in years of returning to its roots as a fund-raiser for journalism education and a salute to superior reporting. Already, one Woodward, one Bernstein and zero Kardashians have R.S.V.P.\u2019d. Since 2008 The New York Times has avoided the dinner, because the schmoozing and gags among journalists, politicians and celebs \u201csends the wrong signal to our readers and viewers,\u201d Dean Baquet, the executive editor, has said. Many have felt that this signal would be even more jarring this year, with a president contemptuous of both the truth and the media. (Before joining The Times, I attended several dinners, unnoticed by pretty much everyone important.) The first correspondents\u2019 dinner was in 1921, when all 50 attendees were journalists \u2014 all white men. They ate at the Arlington Hotel near the White House, enjoyed a satirical piano singalong and \u201csuch fun as the Prohibition era afforded,\u201d as one participant said then. The first president to attend this Rotary Club-style knees-up was Calvin Coolidge, in 1924. In 1954 Irving Berlin sang \u201cI Still Like Ike,\u201d a song he\u2019d written for Dwight Eisenhower; there\u2019s no evidence reporters joined in. Dinners have included performing dogs, jugglers, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra and Duke Ellington. In 1962, John F. Kennedy, nudged by Helen Thomas, alpha female of the press corps, refused to attend unless women were at last admitted. The dinner took its star turn in 1987, when Michael Kelly, then a Baltimore Sun reporter, \u201cpulled off the social coup of the year,\u201d according to The Los Angeles Times, by escorting Fawn Hall, \u201cthe mysterious and beautiful secretary [who] has barely uttered two words to reporters since she was granted immunity in the investigation of the Iran-contra arms scandal.\u201d In 1988 his date was Donna Rice, whose relationship with Gary Hart wrecked his presidential bid. Today the event lasts a televised five hours, its red carpet worn bare by a Star Wars bar of celebrities and politicos, media brass, corporate advertisers and lobbyists who foot the $3,000 per-table bill. Inviting a topical, incongruous or offensive guest scores more bragging rights than winning one of the journalism awards. Presidentially embarrassing guests have included Paula Jones, the Bill Clinton accuser, whose security detail barred others when she used the ladies\u2019 room, causing insurrection; Susan McDougal, convicted in the Whitewater affair; and Valerie Plame, the C.I.A. spy exposed by the George W. Bush administration. Reporters cringe to meet media \u201cpersonalities\u201d like Jerry Springer, Dr. Ruth and kinda-dumb-in-person actors who play reporters. In 1988 Vanna White, the letter turner on the \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d game show, arrived on the arm of Sylvester Stallone and hobnobbed with C. Everett Koop, the surgeon general. In 2002 George W. Bush called out to Ozzy Osbourne, reeling off hits like \u201cFace in Hell\u201d and \u201cBloodbath in Paradise,\u201d saying, \u201cOzzy, Mom loves your stuff.\u201d In 2012, The Washington Times brought Uggie, the little dog in the movie \u201cThe Artist\u201d; in 2013, CBS News invited Psy, from the \u201cGangnam Style\u201d video. After the kibitzing drowned out the scholarships and awards, the president would take the podium, as the opening act for a celebrity who then roasted him. (The association\u2019s Wikipedia page includes a roster of each year\u2019s entertainers, but the award recipients list hasn\u2019t been updated since 2012.) It also speaks to what\u2019s gone wrong with the dinner that in 2011, remembered for President Barack Obama\u2019s deft takedown of Mr. Trump, hundreds of journalists dined with the president and his national security team on the eve of Osama bin Laden\u2019s killing, and nobody suspected a thing. This year, Mr. Trump has granted his media tormentors a bigly favor. The lingering threat of his presence has kept most of the celebrity-industrial complex away. Parties like the Vanity Fair-Bloomberg fete, so exclusive that it excludes most reporters, are off. Hasan Minhaj of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d will entertain, but Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein \u2014 those Watergate reporters played by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman \u2014 get top billing. They\u2019ll speak about \u201cthe First Amendment and the importance of aggressive but fair reporting,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. Asked if they\u2019d crack jokes, he said, \u201cI think having two old guys like Carl and me will be enough comedy.\u201d Amen.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/one-woodward-one-bernstein-no-trump-and-no-kardashian.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T03:21:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "created_date": "2017-04-28T03:21:24-04:00", "abstract": "With the president avoiding its annual dinner, the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association gets a chance to drain its own swamp.", "title": "One Woodward, One Bernstein, No Trump and No Kardashian"}
