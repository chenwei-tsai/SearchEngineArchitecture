{"text": "President Trump made several claims about Andrew Jackson, the populist president for whom Mr. Trump has stated admiration, and appeared to question the necessity of the American Civil War, in comments released ahead of an interview set to air on satellite radio on Monday. The interview was conducted by Salena Zito, a host on SiriusXM\u2019s P.O.T.U.S. channel, who spoke to the president for a story that was published on Sunday in the Washington Examiner. More of that interview was to air later on Monday. The comments quickly drew condemnation from some who said they appeared to show the president misunderstanding American history. Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said the comments were the \u201cheight of inaccurate historical revisionism.\u201d Here is an assessment of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims with the help of Jon Meacham, the historian whose 2008 biography, \u201cAmerican Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House\u201d won a Pulitzer Prize. President Trump is correct that the 1828 race between Andrew Jackson and the incumbent, John Quincy Adams, was hard-fought and often descended into ad hominem attacks on both sides. The insults leveled at Jackson\u2019s wife, Rachel, were particularly vicious \u2014 she was accused of marrying Jackson before her divorce from her first husband, Lewis Robards, was final. The campaign took a notable toll on Rachel Donelson Robards Jackson. She died suddenly, shortly before Christmas in 1828. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Jackson believed that the campaign had killed his wife,\u201d Mr. Meacham said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically right.\u201d Jackson died in 1845. The Civil War broke out in 1861. Mr. Meacham said he thought that Mr. Trump may have been referring to the nullification crisis, which did occur during Jackson\u2019s lifetime. The crisis, which began in 1832, was a conflict between the federal government and South Carolina, a Southern state that would later be instrumental in the movement for secession. During the crisis, President Jackson \u201ctook a firm stand on the side of the union,\u201d Mr. Meacham said, adding, \u201cThere are two stray Trumpian ideas that collided into each other when he talked.\u201d Mr. Trump has questioned the necessity of the Civil War before, in an interview with Mr. Meacham before the election. At the time, President Trump said that he had \u201calways felt that the South overplayed their hand,\u201d he told Mr. Meacham. Had Jackson been alive at the start of the Civil War, Mr. Meacham said, it would be difficult to predict his reaction. It would have brought his commitment to the Union into conflict with his identity as an unapologetic slave owner. Mr. Jackson was from Tennessee, which fought for the Confederacy. Mr. Trump visited his tomb there this year. But any president would have had to contend with the South\u2019s attempt to expand the institution of slavery into territory newly acquired by the United States. It\u2019s what Mr. Meacham called the unavoidable historical question. \u201cThe expansion of slavery caused the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. So what does Trump mean? Would he have let slavery exist but not expand? That\u2019s the counterfactual question you have to ask.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/trump-andrew-jackson-fact-check.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T13:28:50-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T13:28:50-04:00", "abstract": "In an interview with Salena Zito, a host on SiriusXM, the president made several claims about Andrew Jackson, the populist president who owned slaves.", "title": "Trump Appears to Question Necessity of Civil War"}
