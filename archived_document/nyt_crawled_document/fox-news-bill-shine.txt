{"text": "Fox News on Monday announced the exit of one of its co-presidents, Bill Shine, removing a holdover from the Roger Ailes era and signaling that the network is prepared to shake up its executive ranks as it tries to move past a season of turmoil that has engulfed it since last summer. Mr. Shine is a veteran newsman and a longtime lieutenant to Mr. Ailes, the former chairman who was forced out amid a sexual harassment scandal in July. Although Mr. Shine was seen as a source of stability in the news division at a turbulent time, his presence was viewed by some employees as a sign that Fox News\u2019s parent, 21st Century Fox, was not serious about its stated commitment to reform the culture of the network. Mr. Shine had been cited in several lawsuits as someone who enabled and concealed Mr. Ailes\u2019s behavior and dismissed concerns from women who complained about it. He has denied all wrongdoing. His departure is sure to roil some of Fox News\u2019s most recognizable stars, with whom Mr. Shine had close relationships. Sean Hannity, the channel\u2019s 10 p.m. mainstay, is particularly close with Mr. Shine, and he publicly defended his friend this week on Twitter, saying that removing Mr. Shine would be \u201cthe total end of the F.N.C. as we know it. Done.\u201d In a memo to the staff Monday afternoon, Rupert Murdoch, who controls the Fox media empire, said that Suzanne Scott would become president of programming and Jay Wallace would become president of news. \u201cI know Bill was respected and liked by everyone at Fox News,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Murdoch wrote. \u201cWe will all miss him.\u2019\u2019", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/business/media/fox-news-bill-shine.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T14:53:13-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T14:53:13-04:00", "abstract": "The removal of the co-president Bill Shine, a holdover from the Roger Ailes era, signaled that the network was prepared to shake up its top ranks.", "title": "Fox News Executive Departs Amid Turmoil"}
