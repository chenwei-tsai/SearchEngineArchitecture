{"text": "Andy Warhol and Truman Capote were famously friends: The artist depicted the writer in his work several times, and the pair spent hundreds of hours in conversation (some of it published). Now pieces of those conversations will be adapted into \u201cWarhol Capote,\u201d a new play opening this September at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. All of the dialogue in the play will be drawn from recorded conversations between the two from the late 1970s, when they intended to create a Broadway play together. The tapes of these conversations were recently discovered and culled through by the director Rob Roth. Mr. Roth hoped to take the play to Broadway in 2015. Instead, it will open at the American Repertory, which has hosted many recent Broadway-bound productions, including \u201cWaitress\u201d and \u201cFinding Neverland.\u201d Michael Mayer, a Tony Award winner for \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d will direct. When Warhol arrived in New York, in 1949, Capote was already a literary star there, and the artist took a keen interest in befriending him. \u201cHe used to write me these letters all the time,\u201d Capote said of Warhol in a 1973 interview with Rolling Stone. \u201cThey were just admiring letters. He seemed a very shy, pale person, rather like he is today. Only much shyer.\u201d When Warhol presented his first New York one-man show in 1952, he called it \u201cFifteen Drawings Based on the Writings of Truman Capote.\u201d The two continued a friendship until Capote\u2019s death in 1984, with many of their conversations published in Interview, Warhol\u2019s magazine. In the later years, Warhol was well aware of Capote\u2019s struggle with alcoholism and drug addiction, which would lead to his death: \u201cHe\u2019s like a different person now, he\u2019s very distant, not friendly,\u201d he wrote in 1980. In 1989, Capote\u2019s words were adapted into the Broadway production \u201cTru,\u201d with Robert Morse in the title role. A play by Calvin Levels about the relationship between Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, entitled \u201cCollaboration: Warhol & Basquiat,\u201d ran Off Broadway at HERE last year. \u201cWarhol Capote\u201d has the support of both the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and the Truman Capote Literary Trust.
