{"text": "New York City this week prepared for the first return of its native-son president since he entered the White House, and the many disruptions sure to appear in his wake, even as the visit earned an asterisk on Tuesday with the disclosure that he would not be staying at Trump Tower, or in the city at all. Earlier in the week, flight restrictions announced by the Federal Aviation Administration indicated that President Trump would spend Thursday night in the city after a dinner reception aboard the U.S.S. Intrepid on the West Side of Manhattan. He would then travel the next day to his country house in New Jersey, at the Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster. But new restrictions announced Tuesday showed Mr. Trump heading straight to Bedminster from the Intrepid. The New York Police Department said it had been advised that Mr. Trump would not be staying in the city. He is expected to stay in Bedminster through the weekend. At least one protest scheduled to take place outside Trump Tower, by the New York State Immigrant Action Fund and the New York Immigration Coalition, will go on as planned, said Steven Choi, the fund\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe president can\u2019t even face the music in his own building?\u201d he said. \u201cNew York City is ready for him, and we\u2019ll be there.\u201d Mr. Trump has said in recent interviews that he hasn\u2019t returned to New York because of the high costs involved with his travel. \u201cGoing back is very expensive for the country,\u201d he said on Fox News on Friday. \u201cI hate to see the New Yorkers with streets closed.\u201d Mr. Trump is scheduled to fly to New York City on Thursday afternoon and travel to the Intrepid, the decommissioned aircraft carrier docked in the Hudson River off West 46th Street, where he will meet Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. The event is a reception and dinner to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, when the two countries fought alongside each other in World War II. The reception on the Intrepid begins at 6:30 p.m., with dinner to follow, and by then, judging by social media, protests outside will have been well underway. Several groups announced protests and marches near the Intrepid before the reception. Two groups, the Working Families Party and Rise and Resist, self-described as \u201cnew and experienced activists committed to opposing, disrupting and defeating any government act that threatens democracy, equality and our civil liberties,\u201d planned to gather separately on streets north and south of the aircraft carrier and march toward each other. Some protests incorporated the whimsical, with reminders that Thursday is also Star Wars Day and suggestions that participants dress accordingly. Other marchers were asked to wear white and to bring pots and pans to bang. \u201cWe want to get as close as possible so they hear us inside,\u201d said Nelini Stamp of the Working Families Party.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/nyregion/trump-visit-new-york-city.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T17:52:00-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T17:52:00-04:00", "abstract": "The president will travel directly to his golf course in New Jersey after an event Thursday on the U.S.S.
