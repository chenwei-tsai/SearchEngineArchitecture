{"text": "New York City schools Chancellor Carmen Fari\u00f1a was in Albany for two days this week, updating the legislature on the progress of the city\u2019s public schools. The meetings offered a preview of the debate over mayoral control, which puts power over the schools in the hands of City Hall, and which Mayor Bill de Blasio must convince the state to renew in what has become an annual ritual. During Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure, the negotiations have not gone well for him. While his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, was granted lengthy periods of mayoral control \u2014 seven years in 2002 and then a six-year extension in 2009 \u2014 Mr. de Blasio has had to fight for just single-year extensions. Last year, the debate got so tense that Mr. de Blasio skipped a hearing on the issue held just opposite City Hall in Lower Manhattan. Mr. de Blasio sent Ms. Fari\u00f1a in his stead. At one point during the hearings, she suggested that appearing before the legislature was a diversion from the business of running the schools. On Tuesday, speaking to the Senate Education Committee, Ms. Fari\u00f1a sounded more upbeat. \u201cI\u2019m really here just to very quickly say some of the exciting things we\u2019re doing in New York City,\u201d she said. As to the de Blasio administration\u2019s record, she suggested, \u201cwhen you look at the list of accomplishments that we\u2019ve had in just three years, that, I think, speaks for itself.\u201d At its core, the mayoral control debate is largely about politics. But it has not helped in making the public case for a longer extension that, so far, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s record on education is fairly modest. And after 12 years of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s education policies, New York is, for better or worse, accustomed to a mayor who thinks very, very big on education. \u201cHe\u2019s not in any way radical with his reforms,\u201d said Priscilla Wohlstetter, a distinguished research professor at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College. \u201cIt\u2019s all been fairly incremental given the national scene.\u201d Mr. de Blasio\u2019s biggest education initiative, and his biggest success, has been the rollout of free, universal prekindergarten for 4-year-olds. Given its size, the expansion went smoothly, though there have been some areas where children have not been able to get seats close to home, and observers say the quality of the program is generally good. With his re-election campaign on the horizon, Mr. de Blasio recently announced a further expansion, which would offer free pre-K to all 3-year-olds by 2021 \u2014 but how it will be funded remains a question. The other major initiative, the Renewal School program, is Mr. de Blasio\u2019s effort to turn around the city\u2019s most troubled schools. The initiative, which has so far cost $386 million, centers on equipping schools with resources to better deal with students\u2019 needs outside of the classroom, such as medical and mental health services. But many parents were reluctant to enroll their children into schools publicly branded as struggling institutions. Results of the program have been mixed. Beyond those big-ticket items, Ms. Fari\u00f1a has largely relied on smaller, targeted efforts: A literacy program focuses on getting students to read on grade level by the end of second grade. A college awareness program for middle schools encourages children to build higher education into their expectations. And initiatives like Algebra for All and AP for All aim to give more students access to higher-level classes. Josh Wallack, a deputy chancellor for strategy and policy at the city\u2019s Education Department, said that taken together, these policies and others create a comprehensive improvement strategy for the entire system. Under Mr. de Blasio, both graduation rates and test scores have continued to rise. The department said that last year, there was an 8 percent increase over the year before in students taking and passing at least one Advanced Placement exam. \u201cOne initiative builds on the next,\u201d Mr. Wallack said. \u201cWhen you talk about the strategy of the administration and the way we\u2019re moving the system, it\u2019s by building these initiatives on top of each other and following a child and their family all the way through, from pre-K to college and career, and beyond.\u201d But others see scattered individual efforts in a vast system of 1.1 million students. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a grand vision,\u201d said Leslie Santee Siskin, a research associate professor at New York University who focuses on high schools. \u201cDe Blasio has not been as visible on education, nor has he made education as visible on his agenda\u201d as Mr. Bloomberg did, she said. Ms. Siskin did say that Mr. de Blasio deserved credit for continuing the progress made under Mr. Bloomberg, as such momentum is easily lost, especially when leadership changes hands. One sticking point in the mayoral control debate is charter schools, which Republicans, who control the Senate, tend to support. Mr. Bloomberg actively promoted the growth of charters, while Mr. de Blasio has had an adversarial relationship some of the sector\u2019s biggest players, like Success Academy. John J. Flanagan, the State Senate majority leader, said on Monday that the Senate would look at the needs of charter schools when considering mayoral control. When asked about the link between the two, Ms. Fari\u00f1a was resistant. \u201cI think mayoral control is an important enough issue that it should stand alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly feel that we\u2019ve proven that we\u2019ve done a great job in the last three years.\u201d This year, the de Blasio administration has said that it is again seeking a multiyear extension. That may not be a likely outcome, but nobody appears to be in favor of going back to the old system, in which the schools were run by the board of education. Mayors were required to fund an organization over which they had no control, which encouraged them to send as little money as possible, and there was little accountability in the system. Catherine Nolan, a Democratic Assemblywoman for Queens and a strong supporter of Ms. Fari\u00f1a, disagreed that the administration\u2019s approach lacked sweep. \u201cI have seen chancellors come and go,\u201d said Ms. Nolan, who is the chairwoman of the Assembly\u2019s Education Committee. \u201cCarmen Fari\u00f1a\u2019s vision is as expansive as any of them.\u201d She said Ms. Fari\u00f1a also \u201cbrings a practical focus that was often lacking in past. That is a positive in my opinion.\" When touring a school with the chancellor, she added later, \u201cyou\u2019re practically under the tables\u201d inspecting the details.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/nyregion/carmen-farina-bill-de-blasio-public-school-control.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T20:35:00-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T20:35:00-04:00", "abstract": "The New York City schools chancellor made the case in Albany for the de Blasio administration\u2019s record on education.", "title": "Chancellor Praises de Blasio\u2019s Education Gains as Debate to Control Schools Nears"}
