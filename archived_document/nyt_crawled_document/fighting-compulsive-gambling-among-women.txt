{"text": "Blinking lights, the clicking sound of coins, and perks like free or inexpensive food, drinks and casino bus trips are enticing many older women to gamble. For some people, that seductive environment can be extremely dangerous. \u201cCasinos are trained to make you feel welcome, while you lose your life,\u201d said Sandra Adell, 70, a literature professor in the Department of Afro-American Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who recounted her experiences as a compulsive gambler in the book \u201cConfessions of a Slot Machine Queen.\u201d In an interview, Professor Adell said that advertisements aimed at older adults often show smiling people, dressed up and looking glamorous, \u201cto create an illusion that plays to people\u2019s weaknesses.\u201d \u201cWhat the industry is doing,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe way it markets and keeps casinos filled with elderly people, is morally reprehensible.\u201d Hard numbers are difficult to find, but Keith Whyte, the executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, said that gambling addiction among older women near or in retirement appears to be increasing in scope and severity, with a devastating impact on personal finances. Marilyn Lancelot, 86, of Sun City, Ariz., for example, said that after being a compulsive gambler for seven years, she was arrested at age 61 for embezzling $350,000 from her job and served nearly a year in prison. \u201cI really thought I\u2019d win the big one deep down in my heart,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cEvery gambler says that.\u201d Ms. Lancelot has described her experiences in the book \u201cGripped by Gambling.\u201d Many experts say that men are often \u201caction\u201d gamblers, who favor blackjack and poker, while women tend to be \u201cescape\u201d gamblers, drawn to games based on luck, like slot machines and lottery tickets. Women often begin gambling later in life than men, sometimes after a major life event, like the death of a spouse or when they become empty nesters. Women are less likely to develop gambling problems than men, Mr. Whyte said, but \u201ctelescoping, the rapid development of problems, is especially pronounced in senior women.\u201d It may seem surprising to some people that women have severe gambling problems, he said. \u201cGrandma is not seen as someone who embezzles money and is taken off to jail,\u201d he said, yet it happens. Many women lose significant amounts of money and jeopardize their futures. \u201cOnce they tap into retirement savings, it\u2019s incredibly hard \u2014 if they are ever able \u2014 to rebuild those savings,\u201d Mr. Whyte said. Stephanie Iacopino, 63, of Toms River, N.J., who works part time in retail sales, said that during years of compulsive gambling, she stole money from family members, friends and clients in a travel business, and ultimately went to prison in 2010 for embezzling about $18,000 from her church. She said she served nearly four months at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women near Clinton, N.J., followed by 22 months in New Jersey\u2019s Intensive Supervision Program, which, the state says, is \u201cmore onerous\u201d than traditional probation. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a nest egg,\u201d said Ms. Iacopino, who is married. \u201cWe live paycheck to paycheck.\u201d But she said that while she is struggling financially, she is happy to be recovering from her addiction. Some women have medical issues associated with gambling, Mr. Whyte said, like bladder problems aggravated by not getting up from slot machines to go to the bathroom. There is anecdotal evidence suggesting that among older people, some medications may lead to compulsive behavior, including gambling addiction. Decreased cognitive functioning can also interfere with the ability to make sound decisions, he added. There is a strong connection between gambling and substance abuse. \u201cIf you are a problem gambler, you are four times more likely to have a problem with alcohol at some point in your life,\u201d he said. \u201cAt a minimum, the rate of problem gambling among people with substance-use disorders is four to five times that found in the general population.\u201d (The council operates a national 24/7 help line for problem gamblers and their families.) Patricia A. Healy, clinical director of Healy Counseling Associates, in Toms River, N.J., which specializes in addiction counseling, said problem gambling among the elderly \u201cis a hot issue and undernoticed in this country.\u201d \u201cGambling is the stepchild of the addiction world,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t smell it, you can\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t observe it,\u201d unless you see someone in action. For certain people, she said, there is an adrenaline rush and \u201csuddenly they\u2019re in the chase. Sadly for some, it\u2019s a death spiral.\u201d Bus trips to casinos are sometimes arranged to coincide with the arrival of pension and Social Security checks, she said, and cases of retirees who cash in their I.R.A.s and pensions, or mortgage or ultimately lose their houses are not uncommon. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of shame.\u201d Neva Pryor, executive director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, said some older people gamble with money intended for medication and find themselves in desperate straits. Some who become suicidal may \u201cdrive out in traffic and get killed so families can collect insurance,\u201d she said. Sam Skolnik, author of \u201cHigh Stakes: The Rising Cost of America\u2019s Gambling Addiction,\u201d said the aftereffects of pathological gambling include social costs that range from loss of productivity at work, domestic crime, suicide and harm to families from rising indebtedness, home foreclosure and bankruptcy. \u201cWhen the elderly gamble, they are often harmed in a more permanent way, sadly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the industry knows that they lose more money than they should.\u201d Sara Slane, senior vice president for public affairs at the American Gaming Association, which represents casinos, said in an email statement, \u201cWhile problem gambling has not increased along with the increase in casinos, the industry and the A.G.A. continue to increase their investment and commitment to responsible gaming programs.\u201d She cited research in The Journal of Gambling Studies that compared telephone surveys conducted in 1999 and 2000 with those from 2011 to 2013, and found that rates of problem gambling remained stable over all and actually declined among women. Rachel Volberg, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences, who studies gambling, said the state of knowledge about the issue in the United States is still inadequate. \u201cThere\u2019s not much support for gambling research in the U.S.,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t until 1980 that pathological gambling was designated as a mental health issue in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively young disorder as far as having recognition.\u201d Ms. Lancelot, of Arizona, who is now retired, said she left prison with nothing but eventually recovered financially. As a felon, getting a job and an apartment was difficult, but she borrowed three months\u2019 rent from her brother, offered to pay the landlord in advance and found work as a secretary with the Arizona state government. Within 10 years, she said, she had two homes, a new car and checking accounts. \u201cI want older people to know that it\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d she said. Ms. Pryor, of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, said older adults can protect themselves from potential gambling problems in retirement by seeking help in managing their finances \u2014 and in planning how to spend their time \u2014 long before they stop working. \u201cWhat people need to realize,\u201d she said, \u201cis, they may win a little, but ultimately, the house always wins.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/retirement/fighting-compulsive-gambling-among-women.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T12:15:00-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T12:15:00-04:00", "abstract": "They often begin later in life than men but can develop serious problems very rapidly.", "title": "Fighting Compulsive Gambling Among Women"}
