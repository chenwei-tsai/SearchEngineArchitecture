The court\u2019s majority did not explain its decision, which was in response to a plea that the state avoid executing Don W. Davis until the United States Supreme Court issued a decision in a pending case. That case, McWilliams v. Dunn, is scheduled for oral argument next week and involves legal questions about expert testimony at criminal trials. The State Supreme Court ruling also applied to a second inmate, Bruce Ward, who had been scheduled to die on Monday but whose execution was stayed late last week. In a sharply worded dissent, Associate Justice Shawn A. Womack complained about the divided court\u2019s decision to grant a stay. \u201cThe petitioners had their day in court, the jury spoke, and decades of appeals have occurred,\u201d Justice Womack wrote. \u201cThe families are entitled to closure and finality of the law.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has said that poor defendants with mental health problems are entitled to expert witnesses to assist them in preparing and presenting their cases. But the court has never directly addressed whether such experts must be independent of the prosecution. On Monday, the court will hear arguments on that question in the in McWilliams v. Dunn case from Alabama. Lawyers for a death row inmate there argue that their client\u2019s rights were violated when a court-appointed psychologist prepared a report that was distributed to both sides. Lawyers for Alabama responded that there is no right to a \u201cpartisan psychiatrist\u201d and that \u201ca neutral court-appointed psychiatrist who is equally available to both parties\u201d is enough. A decision is expected by June. Mr. Davis, who did not seek executive clemency, was convicted more than 25 years ago for the death of Jane Daniel, whose husband found her in a pool of blood at home in northwest Arkansas. \u201cSomebody got hurt,\u201d Mr. Davis told his roommates after the October 1990 murder, according to a court ruling. He fled west and was arrested in New Mexico. \u201cWhat I did was an act of cowardice,\u201d Mr. Davis said in an interview with an Arkansas television station in 2015. \u201cIt was coldblooded. It was evil. The day I was found guilty in Bentonville, if they would have took me out that next day and executed me, I feel as though it would have been a just execution.\u201d Recalling Ms. Daniel\u2019s murder, Mr. Davis also said in that interview, \u201cThere is nothing in this world that I wouldn\u2019t give to change that moment.\u201d Mr. Davis has repeatedly faced the threat of lethal injection \u2014 he came within hours of being put to death in 2010 \u2014 and Ms. Daniels\u2019s daughter noted last month that she had traveled to Pine Bluff, near the prison, four times for executions that were eventually put off. Mr. Ward was sentenced to death in 1990 for the slaying of an 18-year-old gas station clerk.", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00"}
