Postpartum hemorrhage, in which women bleed uncontrollably after childbirth, kills an estimated 100,000 women a year in poor and middle-income countries. The complication also forces doctors to perform emergency hysterectomies, especially when hospitals have too little blood on hand to provide transfusions. In a major six-year trial involving over 20,000 women in 21 countries, researchers showed that tranexamic acid, a little-known blood-clotter invented in the 1950s, reduced maternal bleeding deaths by a third if it was given within three hours. It costs less than $2 a dose and does not require refrigeration. The trial \u2014 known as Woman, short for World Maternal Antifibrinolytic \u2014 was led by doctors at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and paid for by the Wellcome Trust, Pfizer, Britain\u2019s health department and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Results were published in The Lancet on Wednesday. \u201cTranexamic acid can save women\u2019s lives and ensure more children grow up with a mother,\u201d said Haleema Shakur, one of the lead authors. The World Health Organization currently recommends treating birth hemorrhages by massaging the uterus and injecting uterus-shrinking drugs like oxytocin. Tranexamic acid acts in a different way \u2014 it allows blood to clot more quickly \u2014 and so it should be given in addition to the usual measures and at the same time, said Dr. Ian Roberts, one of the study\u2019s lead authors. \u201cWomen die very quickly from this, especially in Africa, because they are so profoundly anemic,\u201d Dr. Roberts said. \u201cHalf the women giving birth there start off with roughly half the red blood cells they should have. If you or I had hemoglobin counts that low, we\u2019d be breathless.\u201d \u201cDoctors are forced to throw in everything they\u2019ve got, because they know the woman can be dead in an hour,\u201d he added. Emergency hysterectomies save some lives, but the women will never bear another child. It is \u201clogical to infer\u201d that such operations would also be reduced if tranexamic acid becomes widely available in delivery rooms, Dr. Roberts said. The drug was invented in Japan by the researchers Shosuke and Utako Okamoto, who are married. They hoped it would be used to prevent birth hemorrhages, but local obstetricians declined to organize a clinical trial. Ultimately, they turned the patent over to a Japanese pharmaceutical company, which sold it as treatment for heavy menstrual periods and as an ingredient in skin-whitening creams. Some oral surgeons used it when doing dental work on hemophiliacs, Dr. Roberts said. (Released with the new study was a video interview Dr. Roberts conducted with 98-year-old Utako Okamoto just before her death last year.) Suspecting that tranexamic acid could also stop major bleeding like that caused by car crashes or bullet wounds, he eventually received British government funding to do a trial in 20,000 emergency-room patients in 40 countries. The results, published in the Lancet in 2010, showed that the drug lowered hemorrhage death rates by 30 percent. The British military was so impressed that it started stocking tranexamic acid in surgical units in Iraq, and American military surgeons followed suit. The W.H.O. added it to a list of essential drugs that all hospitals should have on hand. Nonetheless, civilian trauma surgeons were slow to adopt tranexamic acid, in part, Dr. Roberts said, because no major drug company conducted a publicity campaign for it. So he did his own, including a movie of a claymation figure bleeding to death and a manga cartoon book about an emergency-room doctor stabbed at work. Now, he said, he will focus on seeing whether the drug, which is given intravenously, can be delivered more easily in rural clinics through intramuscular shot or even a pill under the tongue.", "title": "Inexpensive Drug Prevents Deaths in New Mothers, Study Finds", "section": "Health", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T18:46:56-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/health/inexpensive-drug-prevents-deaths-in-new-mothers-study-finds.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00"}
