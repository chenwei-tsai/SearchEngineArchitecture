But in political terms, for a mayor seeking re-election as a progressive defined by his defiance of President Trump, the swipe from the federal government was more like a gift. It allowed Mr. de Blasio, in one moment, both to burnish his anti-Trump credentials and to wrap himself up in police uniform blue. The mayor, a Democrat, wasted no time on Friday in summoning the news media to Police Headquarters in Manhattan, where he stood beside his police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill. Mr. de Blasio shot back at Mr. Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who had sent New York and several other cities and jurisdictions a letter renewing threats to cut federal grant money if they did not remove communication barriers between the local police and immigration authorities. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s strategy is Trump, and it kind of gave him a lifeline in a lot of ways,\u201d Suri Kasirer, a Democratic political consultant, said, referring to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign strategy of serving as a foil to a president who is intensely unpopular in New York City. \u201cAnd it is certainly making lots of people who might not agree with him on every issue feel like he\u2019s standing up for them.\u201d She added: \u201cThe Trump administration doesn\u2019t realize, or isn\u2019t focused on, how every time they hit New York or hit him, they\u2019re actually doing him a favor politically. They\u2019re stepping right into his strategy.\u201d The Justice Department\u2019s letter was accompanied by a statement saying that many of the jurisdictions cited were \u201ccrumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime.\u201d And it singled out New York, saying the city \u201ccontinues to see gang murder after gang murder, the predictable consequence of the city\u2019s \u2018soft on crime\u2019 stance.\u201d Mr. de Blasio called the accusations outrageous and absurd and said at the Friday news conference that \u201cthe notion of calling this city and our Police Department \u2018soft on crime\u2019 is unacceptable on its face and flies in the face of everything we have seen over the last quarter-century in this city.\u201d The mayor and Mr. O\u2019Neill cited police data showing that most major crimes had continued to decline sharply and were at historically low levels. So far, Mr. de Blasio has appeared to be coasting toward re-election, with no well-financed Democratic challengers. At the same time, the smattering of Republican and independent candidates jockeying to run in November has consisted of untested newcomers who would have a difficult time gaining traction in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans among registered voters by more than six to one. And any Republican who ran against Mr. de Blasio would suffer from associations with Mr. Trump. \u201cAny time Bill de Blasio is talking about Donald Trump, he\u2019s winning,\u201d said William F. B. O\u2019Reilly, a Republican political consultant who has worked with one of the Republicans seeking to run for mayor, the real estate sales executive Paul J. Massey Jr. \u201cIt protects him on his left and in the center with the non-Trump supporter,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said, \u201cand to some extent it protects him as a crime fighter on the right, so it\u2019s a double win whenever he gets to play that card.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly also said Mr. de Blasio\u2019s strategy was an effective way of sidelining the Republican mayoral hopefuls. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for anyone else in the conversation,\u201d he said. Phil Walzak, a senior adviser to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign, said the mayor was right to issue an aggressive response to the Justice Department\u2019s statement. \u201cThis demonstrates very much what Mayor de Blasio is about: standing up for and fighting for the people of New York, the city and the institutions of the city like the N.Y.P.D., against outrageous and factless statements like the one made by D.O.J. on Friday,\u201d Mr. Walzak said. On Sunday, Mr. Sessions appeared to back off the assertion that New York was soft on crime, saying during an interview on \u201cThis Week\u201d on ABC that the comment referred only to the city\u2019s policy toward cooperation with immigration authorities. \u201cFor four decades, New York has been a fabulous city for law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cThey have developed some of the best techniques ever. They\u2019re so far ahead of many other cities.\u201d He even praised some of the policing strategies supported by Mr. de Blasio, saying, \u201cThey have proven community-based policing, broken-windows policing, to make cities safer, saved lives, and other cities need to be studying what they\u2019ve done.\u201d The risk for the Republicans and independents hoping to unseat Mr. de Blasio is that confrontations like these might position those who question the mayor\u2019s crime-fighting bona fides on the side of Mr. Trump. Bo Dietl, a former police officer who until recently was a registered Republican, has announced his candidacy as an independent for mayor. Mr. Dietl, who operates a private security company, has been sharply critical of Mr. de Blasio on public safety and policing issues. \u201cYes, I think they\u2019re soft on crime, and it\u2019s the directive right from City Hall down through the police commissioner, and the poor cops have to take the brunt of walking around and being spat on, being treated like garbage,\u201d Mr. Dietl said, pointing to discontent among rank-and-file police officers with Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Dietl voted for Mr. Trump in November, but he said that should not define him as a candidate. \u201cDonald Trump is a narcissistic personality,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a narcissist. I\u2019m not a billionaire.\u201d", "abstract": "Criticism from the Trump administration, which is highly unpopular in New York, has seemed only to aid Mayor de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign."}
