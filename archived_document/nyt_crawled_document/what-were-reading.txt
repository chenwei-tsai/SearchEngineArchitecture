You can receive What We\u2019re reading by email, and let us know how you like it at wwr@nytimes.com. From The Times: This week in partisan writing you shouldn\u2019t miss: Ann Coulter\u2019s critical take on President Trump\u2019s actions in Syria, Masha Gessen on some Trump-Putin similarities, and the one item of clothing both the right and the left love to wear. \u2014 Anna Dubenko, senior digital strategist _____ From The Guardian: Lisa Davis thought her identity was being stolen. For almost 20 years, troubling but largely minor infractions she didn\u2019t commit ended up on her record. When she finally dug into the details, she learned of other Lisa Davises in New York City, who were, unlike her, living in neighborhoods with large black or Hispanic populations. She confronted how unequally the law is applied and forged a deep friendship with one of the doppelg\u00e4ngers. \u2014 Adeel Hassan, reporter, Race/Related _____ From Climate Central: An artist took classic promotional posters for America\u2019s national parks and updated them to imagine how man-made global climate change will affect them by the year 2050. It\u2019s a gut punch to see these instantly recognizable illustrations of nature transformed this way. You can think of it as highly effective op-art that warns of what we have to lose in our warming world. \u2014 Michael Roston, senior staff editor, Science _____ From The Leap, KQED: There\u2019s been a revived interest in the therapeutic uses of LSD \u2014 most recently in micro-dosing with the psychedelic drug to treat depression and other disorders. This podcast, from reporters Amy Standen and Judy Campbell, looks a use case from decades ago that went in the other direction: In the early \u201960s, a psychologist used LSD in extremely large doses to treat severely emotionally disturbed children, some as young as 4. The approach, and the results, are shocking. \u2014 Dan Saltzstein, assistant editor, Travel _____ From California Sunday: Why is good, healthy food out of reach for the poor? Why do they have to be stuck with processed, unhealthy, fast food? A star chef asks those questions as he tries to build a new kind of fast food chain, but the answers are complicated for a fascinating array of reasons. \u2014 Prashant Rao, deputy Europe business Editor _____ From The Economist: One person can make a difference \u2014 for hedgehogs. This lovely obituary describes the life of Adrian Coles, a local official in Shropshire who quietly crusaded, at his daughter\u2019s urging, to save the lowly and beloved hedgehog. He championed simple measures like building small ramps over cattle gates. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose hedgehogs,\u201d he would say. \u201cI had hedgehogs thrust upon me.\u201d \u2014 John Schwartz, science reporter", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/insider/what-were-reading.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T16:37:56-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "What We\u2019re Reading", "created_date": "2017-04-18T16:37:56-04:00", "section": "Times Insider"}
