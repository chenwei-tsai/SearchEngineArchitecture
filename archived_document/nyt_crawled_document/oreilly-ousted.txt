In a letter to Fox News employees (obtained by CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter), Murdoch wrote that \u201cwe want to underscore our consistent commitment to fostering a work environment built on the values of trust and respect.\u201d This claim is false, and Murdoch\u2019s use of \u201cconsistent\u201d is especially rich. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s pattern of harassing women has been clear for more than a decade. Megan Garber of The Atlantic has a useful review \u2014 incomplete, no doubt \u2014 of his behavior. A sudden onset of morality didn\u2019t bring down O\u2019Reilly after all of these years. Two other forces did instead. First, a new wave of attention on his behavior \u2014 kicked off by a New York Times investigation \u2014 created risks for the Fox brand. Advertisers were fleeing. Women inside the network were furious. British regulators were on the verge of making a multibillion-dollar decision about a different part of Murdoch\u2019s empire, which involved evaluating whether the family was a \u201cfit and proper\u201d manager, as Gabriel Sherman of New York magazine noted. Second, the younger generation of Murdochs \u2014 particularly James and Lachlan, two of Rupert\u2019s sons \u2014 may take a different view of boorishness and abuse than Rupert Murdoch does. Until almost the end, the patriarch was in O\u2019Reilly\u2019s corner, Sherman reported. The \u201cvalues of trust and respect\u201d somehow weren\u2019t strong enough to prevent Murdoch from protecting O\u2019Reilly all these years. But if O\u2019Reilly\u2019s firing wasn\u2019t based on morals, it is still a victory for morality. A man who spent years abusing people less wealthy and powerful than him has lost his large public stage, in a very public way. His legacy \u2014 like that of his old boss, Roger Ailes \u2014 will always involve his ugly abusiveness.", "item_type": "Article"}
