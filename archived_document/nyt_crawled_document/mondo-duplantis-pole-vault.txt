It was, until recently, the training site for the family\u2019s youngest son, Armand. On April 1, at the Texas Relays, he vaulted 19 feet 4 1/4 inches, a national high school record, a world junior record and the highest jump at any level of international competition so far in this outdoor season. A vault of that height at the Rio Olympics last summer would have won a bronze medal. Armand Duplantis \u2014 known as Mondo \u2014 is the only high school vaulter to have cleared 19 feet, and he has already done it twice this year. He is considered a medal candidate at the world track and field championships in August in London. This is extraordinary, given that Duplantis is only 17, a junior at Lafayette High School who competes in an event where athletes tend to reach their prime in their late 20s. \u201cIt is off the scale; nobody\u2019s seen anything like this,\u201d said Earl Bell, a prominent pole-vault coach from Arkansas who won bronze at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and once held the world record. \u201cHe\u2019s the Tiger Woods of pole vaulting.\u201d There is only one drawback \u2014 Duplantis has outgrown his home training facility. He is jumping so high, the padding on a brick wall next to the landing pit might provide insufficient cushioning if a vault went sideways. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe, I don\u2019t think,\u201d said his father, Greg, a lawyer. So Duplantis trains at his high school, and field mice have the run of the training space back home. \u201cThey love a good pit,\u201d Greg Duplantis said with a laugh. \u201cAs do possums.\u201d If Mondo Duplantis\u2019s achievement seems startling, it may be viewed another way as a natural, if accelerated, progression for a young star in a family of elite athletes, all of whom attended Louisiana State University, a longtime power in track and baseball. His father was an all-American pole-vaulter who jumped 19 feet 1/4 inch as a professional. His mother, Helena, a native of Sweden, was a heptathlete and volleyball player. His eldest brother, Andreas, finished as high as third at the Southeastern Conference indoor vaulting championships. The family\u2019s middle son, Antoine, played in the Little League World Series in 2005 and is now an outfielder at L.S.U., having recently set a school record with six hits in a game. \u201cHaving two older brothers very good at sports, we were very competitive,\u201d Mondo Duplantis said. \u201cIt was kind of fun to be good at something, and it\u2019s such a unique event.\u201d Covering the window in his bedroom is the blue and gold national flag of Sweden, his mother\u2019s homeland and the country that Duplantis represents in international competition. Helena Duplantis, a personal trainer and dietitian, said her sons had spent their summers in Sweden and become comfortable with its youth sports development system, which is based in clubs instead of schools. Strategically, by competing for Sweden, Duplantis does not have to qualify for the world championships or the Olympics by finishing in the top three at a trials competition, as he would if representing the United States. Inevitably, there have been some grumblings about Duplantis\u2019s patriotism, but he said that competing for Sweden was in the best interest of his career. Sam Kendricks of Oxford, Miss., the 2016 Olympic bronze medalist and a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve, said he supported Duplantis\u2019s decision as a \u201cvery professional way of looking at it.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got dual citizenship; he\u2019s proud of his mother\u2019s heritage, and he\u2019s proud of his American heritage,\u201d said Kendricks, who has known Duplantis and his family for years. \u201cI know a lot of people are going to say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you compete for the United States?\u2019 But that\u2019s not the point of it for him. The point is to jump high and elevate the sport.\u201d The stories of Duplantis the daredevil began when he was in diapers and climbed a neighbor\u2019s crepe myrtle tree, only to have a panicked passer-by call 911. Later, he skateboarded off the roof with his brothers. He began vaulting with a broomstick in the living room, using an ottoman as a landing pit. By 7, he was a world age-group champion, preferring to jump barefoot until he was required to wear spikes. His father built a landing pit in the backyard, first using carpet foam bound with a trawling net. Eventually, the family upgraded to a regulation foam pit and the 125-foot elevated runway, bought at auction and made of plywood, an aluminum frame and rubber cushioning. In January 2016, Mondo Duplantis vaulted 10 feet in the backyard while launching himself from a hoverboard. The video went viral. (Risk is inherent in his sport, so perhaps it is not surprising that he also hosts a weekly poker game with friends.) Since he was a boy, Duplantis has been widely known in the niche world of elite vaulters as supremely confident, inquisitive, efficient in his technique and reliable in the most important competitions. He is also an expert on his event\u2019s arcane history. Kendricks, the Olympic bronze medalist, calls him pole vaulting\u2019s \u201cbook of knowledge.\u201d \u201cTell him I said, \u2018You\u2019re no longer a high school jumper in my head; you\u2019re a competitor,\u2019\u201d Kendricks said. \u201c\u2018When you break into that final bracket of competition, it doesn\u2019t matter how old you are. We want to jump against you and learn from you.\u2019\u201d Also in his bedroom, Duplantis keeps a signed poster, singlet and biography of Renaud Lavillenie of France, the world-record holder at 20 feet 1/2 inches and the 2012 Olympic champion. The two exchange Twitter messages and are scheduled to compete next month at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., along with Thiago Braz da Silva of Brazil, the gold medalist at the Rio Olympics, and Kendricks. Duplantis, who hopes to vault 19 feet 8 1/4 inches this year \u2014 just over six inches shy of Lavillenie\u2019s world record \u2014 speaks in a sober, businesslike manner of his career goals. By the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, he said, his aim is to be \u201cthe best in the world and going for the gold medal.\u201d Eventually, there will be a decision to make about how long to remain an amateur and when to turn pro. At 17, Duplantis is not ready to travel regularly around the world to compete, his father said. \u201cHe may be a good enough pole-vaulter, but he needs a little more formal and life education to do it,\u201d Greg Duplantis said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see this time next year.\u201d Of course, there are any number of reasons high school stardom may not translate into Olympic prominence \u2014 injury, burnout, expanding interests, bad luck. Casey Carrigan, a pole-vaulter from Orting, Wash., made the Olympic team for the 1968 Mexico City Games as a 17-year-old and later set a national high school record of 17 feet, 4 3/4 inches, but his jumping career settled into anticlimax. He found satisfaction as a fireman. Bell, the former world-record holder and a friend of the Duplantis family, said that Mondo Duplantis was fortunate to have parents who understand the patience and training needed to sustain a career. \u201cThere\u2019s no big red flag,\u201d Bell said. \u201cHe\u2019s in a good place with a lot of good help.\u201d At first glance, Duplantis, thin and rangy at 5 feet 10 inches and 145 pounds, does not appear to be a world-class vaulter. Many are taller than 6 feet and heavier. But he can dunk a basketball, his father said, and has long-jumped 23 feet 3 inches. He also runs the anchor leg on Lafayette High\u2019s 4x100-meter relay; his split has been hand-timed at 10.55 seconds. He has developed strength specific to his event, in part, by hanging upside down, like a bat, in the backyard and doing inverted pull-ups, using a device fashioned from a rope, foot straps, weights and a pulley. \u201cHe\u2019s fearless,\u201d said Gavin Nettles, 18, a senior at Barbe High in Lake Charles, La., who competes regularly against Duplantis. \u201cHe looks at the bar and says: \u2018I\u2019m flying over that. I\u2019m taking it.\u2019\u201d There is perhaps no event in track and field more technically demanding than the pole vault, which requires a jolting, gymnastic transition from horizontal speed to vertical lift. \u201cMondo does probably the best job of anybody in the world right now in maximizing the energy he brings down the runway and transitioning into the air,\u201d said Jeff Hartwig, a former American record holder and an agent who represents elite pro vaulters. A technique favored by many vaulters is to drive the front knee high and let the trail leg swing upward like a pendulum. But Duplantis believes he generates more momentum by swinging both legs in a retro style employed by vaulters who once used rigid poles made of bamboo and aluminum. Duplantis uses fiberglass poles that are longer and stiffer, and held with a higher grip, than other high school vaulters. And he has the speed, strength and technique to bend and control the recoil of poles designed for vaulters as heavy as 195 pounds \u2014 50 above his own weight. The result, in his father\u2019s description, is to fling upward like a projectile in a cafeteria food fight. \u201cThink about a pea on a plastic spoon that\u2019s shooting across a cafeteria,\u201d Greg Duplantis said. \u201cThe spoon is elastic. You pull back the plastic, and the stiffer it is, the harder it springs back and the farther the pea goes.\u201d Last year, Mondo Duplantis became the first high school vaulter to surpass 18 feet indoors. That height has now become routine for him. He is jumping more than a foot higher outdoors. Last month, in response to an online challenge issued by Kendricks, Andreas Duplantis posted a video showing his brother clearing 18 feet 1/2 inch 10 times in 28 minutes, a remarkable display of endurance and consistency. The bar figures to keep getting higher and higher. \u201cHe\u2019s come out of his cocoon this year,\u201d Kendricks said. \u201cNow he\u2019s a freakin\u2019 butterfly.\u201d", "abstract": "Mondo Duplantis is the only high school vaulter to have cleared 19 feet, and he has done it twice this year. At just 17, he aims to elevate his sport."}
