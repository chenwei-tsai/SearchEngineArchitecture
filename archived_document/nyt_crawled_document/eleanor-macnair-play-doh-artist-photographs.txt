{"text": "The artist Eleanor Macnair is an expert on the subject of Play-Doh. Different colors have different textures, she explains: \u201cThe whites are usually very soft; the black\u2019s quite oily.\u201d The children who play with the modeling clay probably haven\u2019t noticed, but Play-Doh is Macnair\u2019s palette: She uses it to recreate her favorite images from the world of documentary photography, then captures her versions on camera. She\u2019s been working in the medium for four years, and published a book \u2014 \u201cPhotographs Rendered In Play-Doh\u201d \u2014 in 2014. Now, she\u2019s produced a new series for the agency Magnum Photos, in honor of its 70th anniversary. Her limited-edition prints, which go on sale today, are her interpretations of images from the agency\u2019s enormous archive, including Elliott Erwitt\u2019s 1955 shot of a solitary figure gazing at the Empire State Building, and Newsha Tavakolian\u2019s 2011 photograph of an Iranian woman emerging from the sea. Macnair\u2019s colorful, three-dimensional homages are a labor of love: building one takes up to seven hours. The human figures are modeled as nudes first, then covered with clothes to give them a lifelike shape. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like when you\u2019re a child and you have the cutout dressing-up dolls,\u201d Macnair says. She creates the Play-Doh image late at night, then leaves it under a cloth while she sleeps. With the morning light, she begins to photograph. \u201cI\u2019m totally working against the clock. The edges start to crack and dry, even within three or four hours, and the colors start to fade.\u201d Once she has what she needs, she immediately dismantles it, saving as much clay as possible to be used again. The project, she says, is partly about making art feel less rarefied and more democratic. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to an art gallery until I was 21 or 22 \u2014 and so that whole world just wasn\u2019t accessible to me,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve worked in galleries and museums, sometimes I still feel like I can\u2019t have an opinion because I didn\u2019t go to art school. And so this is a way of bringing photography to a wide audience and saying, \u2018Yeah, you can be interested in this too.\u2019\u201d The fact that Play-Doh is cheap, she says, that its colors are bold and na\u00efve and that her images sometimes include visible imperfections, is all part of the appeal. Macnair has an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of photography, but has found that working in this way has given her an unintended new perspective. \u201cI end up looking at photos in a completely different way,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018Could I do that in Play-Doh? Would it work?\u2019\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/t-magazine/art/eleanor-macnair-play-doh-artist-photographs.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "T Magazine", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T10:00:19-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T10:00:19-04:00", "abstract": "The artist Eleanor Macnair has produced a series for the Magnum Photo agency, remaking some of its most historic images in Play-Doh.", "title": "10 Classic Photographs \u2014 Reinterpreted Entirely in Play-Doh"}
