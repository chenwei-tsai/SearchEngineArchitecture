{"text": "NICE, France \u2014 France\u2019s far-right presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, came out swinging against her centrist opponent, Emmanuel Macron, on Thursday night, depicting him as an unpatriotic out-of-touch banker in a tough, slashing speech intended to fuel her uphill bid for an upset in the May 7 runoff. The showdown is a clash of opposites, a contest between her superheated anti-immigrant, xenophobic language and his cool and lofty formulas for restoring France\u2019s economy while upholding its global alliances. On Thursday, to an adoring crowd of thousands in Nice, Ms. Le Pen made the most of that contrast in her first speech since finishing second in the first round of voting on Sunday. Mr. Macron, a former economy minister and banker, was a \u201cglobalist,\u201d an \u201cimmigrationist\u201d and someone who is capable of cutting himself off from the country, Ms. Le Pen roared to flag-waving supporters at a vast auditorium at the edge of town. The boos for Mr. Macron lasted for minutes. Still, the odds are sharply against her. Polls show Ms. Le Pen trailing by more than 20 percent. But in the last few days, she has gained some momentum while Mr. Macron has stumbled since the first round. She upstaged him among factory workers in the north on Wednesday, campaigned early Monday at the main market outside Paris to steal the thunder of his victory party at a fashionable Left Bank restaurant, and was on a fishing boat at daybreak Thursday with fishermen, television cameras in tow. Mr. Macron has dropped slightly in some polls, and commentators have suggested that his campaign is stagnating. Ms. Le Pen came bounding onto the stage at the Palais Nikaia on Thursday night, evidently buoyed by the media attention of the last few days. She immediately lashed out at her younger and more inexperienced opponent, questioning his patriotism, and in one of the far right\u2019s oldest tropes, suggesting that his policies meant that he was not French enough. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to call himself a patriot,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the pyromaniac who wants to be called a fireman,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is a referendum for or against France. I ask you to choose France. His horizon is the devalorization of France.\u201d Mr. Macron was the choice of an \u201coligarchy,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said, a favorite boogeyman in her speeches that is never precisely defined. But in a line of attack that could carry weight with millions of undecided, deeply anticapitalist voters who opted for the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round, Ms. Le Pen tore into her opponent\u2019s background in finance. \u201cI think he could be a good banker,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the insensitivity of that profession, with no conscience for the human consequences of his decisions.\u201d After Mr. Macron was shown on Wednesday in television images sitting stiffly in a room with union officials while Ms. Le Pen was taking selfies with factory workers nearby, the former economy minister tried to show a more human side on Thursday, kicking a soccer ball around in an immigrant Paris suburb where \u201cMrs. Le Pen can\u2019t come,\u201d he said, because \u201cshe wants them all to get out.\u201d But in a possibly ominous sign for Mr. Macron, thousands of people demonstrated against both candidates in several cities across France, shouting for the so-called neither-nor option. A low turnout in the second round would help Ms. Le Pen, and she appears to be acutely aware of that. On Thursday she repeatedly tried to sow doubt about her opponent\u2019s commitment to the welfare of the working class, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s base of support, which she wants to grab. \u201cWhose ambitions is he really serving?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe\u2019s preparing a lightning strike against the workers,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. \u201cThe country that Emmanuel Macron wants is not a country anymore. It\u2019s a place where the law of the strongest rules.\u201d And in Nice, a city still reeling from a terrorist attack in July that killed dozens, she painted a picture of an Islamist menace, vowing to confront \u201cprovocations from the Islamists in the cafeterias, in the hospitals, in the streets.\u201d As is often the case in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s speeches, this was linked to what she calls \u201cthe migratory submersion,\u201d identified with her opponent. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s aides said before Thursday\u2019s rally that they were convinced that she was gaining momentum, for the moment. Mr. Macron \u201chas revealed himself as the puppet of the old system, of the right and the left,\u201d said Gilbert Collard, one of only two lawmakers affiliated with Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front and a constant presence at her side. \u201cHe\u2019s shown his inconsistency,\u201d Mr. Collard said. \u201cThere\u2019s a dynamic there, for sure.\u201d Mr. Macron \u201cis trying to defy her,\u201d said Julien Sanchez, a leading National Front mayor in the south. \u201cHe realizes he\u2019s lost something, and he\u2019s trying to catch up.\u201d Those words were echoed by her fans in the stands, as were the candidate\u2019s now familiar anti-immigrant themes. Mr. Macron \u201cdoesn\u2019t have enough experience,\u201d said Sandrine Berett, an office manager. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop giving handouts to foreigners,\u201d Ms. Berett said. \u201cThey come here just to profit from the system.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/europe/france-marine-le-pen-emmanuel-macron.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T20:40:30-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T20:40:30-04:00", "abstract": "At a rally in Nice the far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen depicted her centrist opponent, Emmanuel Macron, as an unpatriotic out-of-touch banker.", "title": "Facing Tough Odds in French Vote, Le Pen Assails Macron"}
