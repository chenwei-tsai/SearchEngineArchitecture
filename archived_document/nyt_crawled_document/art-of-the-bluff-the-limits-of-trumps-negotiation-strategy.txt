{"text": "In 1987, the real estate developer Donald J. Trump wanted to buy an airplane. He sensed that the seller of the Boeing 727 was desperate, so he first offered a mere $5 million, \u201cwhich was obviously ridiculously low,\u201d he wrote in \u201cArt of the Deal.\u201d He boasts of buying the plane, worth $30 million new, for just $8 million. This week, we saw the public policy equivalent of a $5 million offer for a $30 million plane. The Trump administration demanded funding of its border wall as part of a deal to keep the government open, proposed a huge cut in taxes on businesses that would reduce government revenue by trillions, and leaked plans to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement to try to force Canada and Mexico to agree to better conditions. It is an approach that has defined Mr. Trump\u2019s dealmaking career: Make some seemingly outlandish offer as a starting point for negotiations to try to shift the entire frame of reference for the haggling that will follow. This strategy can certainly work in certain circumstances. It also has distinct limits in complex negotiations like those involved in public policy, as the administration\u2019s experience this week shows. This negotiating strategy is also the opposite of that often pursued by the last occupant of the Oval Office. President Obama tended to introduce policy proposals that were relatively close to where a negotiation with Congress might plausibly end up \u2014 often to the consternation of liberals, who felt he was negotiating against himself. The Trump approach can indeed result in a favorable deal in certain circumstances. It can have an \u201canchoring effect\u201d of shaping the terms of the negotiation. \u201cThe benefit of starting aggressively is that if a deal is reached, it is likely to be more advantageous to you,\u201d said Deepak Malhotra, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of \u201cNegotiating the Impossible.\u201d \u201cBut there are also many risks, and these risks are much greater in politics.\u201d In particular, staking out an extreme position can very well shut down any further negotiating. If you think your negotiation partner is fundamentally unreasonable, you might choose not to engage at all. Think of how you might respond if you were selling a house that you believed was worth $500,000, and somebody offered $100,000. You\u2019d probably be unwilling to discuss a sale unless the bidder came back with a more plausible number. That\u2019s even more true when public image and credibility are on the line, as they always are in politics. \u201cAggressive offers make it hard for parties to save face or declare victory later in the negotiation process \u2014 and this is especially crucial in politics,\u201d Mr. Malhotra said. In Mr. Trump\u2019s 1987 negotiation over buying an airplane, staking out an extreme offer carried minimal risk and probably resulted in his getting a better price than if he had been less aggressive. The worst thing that could happen to Mr. Trump would be that no deal happened and he would need to find another airplane to buy. But in these policy issues, both the president and his negotiating partners have their public reputations on the line. If Democrats were to give in on funding the border wall, they might lose any hope of gaining seats in the midterms. If the extreme starting point on taxes prevents Democrats or deficit hawk Republicans from even coming to the table for negotiations, that could make it harder for any tax deal happen. And this is even more true when there is some element of a bluff involved, as the Trump administration\u2019s counterparties have clearly concluded. Think of a bluff and a lowball offer as tools that are often used in tandem \u2014 any time someone makes an extreme offer but is either explicitly or implicitly lying about what will happen if it is not accepted. The problem is that when dealmaking in the public sphere, it\u2019s particularly hard to pull off an extreme bluff. For one thing, Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation for using the technique precedes him. For another, on public issues like the budget or trade agreements, the other parties to the negotiation have a pretty good idea of what the Trump administration has to lose if no deal is struck. On trade, for example, negotiators for Mexico and Canada are well aware of the economic damage that would befall the United States in the event Nafta was unwound, and of the major industries and political leaders who would attack President Trump for letting it happen. On funding the government this week, Democrats have been confident that the Trump administration would bear the blame for any government shutdown, and thus have been unwilling to entertain any major spending on a border wall. Pairing an aggressive request with a bluff, in other words, works best when the other party is both in a desperate situation to make a deal and can\u2019t know for sure whether your threat is real. \u201cIn many years of teaching negotiations, I\u2019ve seen many people becoming enthralled with the apparent power of making extreme first offers,\u201d said An Oa professor at Columbia Business School. \u201cThey sometimes get \u2018anchoring fever,\u2019 jumping at the chance to put the first offer on the table and making that number strain credulity. To be sure, it can work.\u201d But, Mr. Ames said: \u201cWhen the proposal is overly brash, our counterparts don\u2019t just blindly capitulate. Sometimes they come back with an outrageous offer in the other direction. And in a good share of cases, they simply walk away.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/upshot/art-of-the-bluff-the-limits-of-trumps-negotiation-strategy.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "The Upshot", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T12:32:30-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T12:32:30-04:00", "abstract": "There are both risks and rewards in starting from an extreme negotiating position.", "title": "Art of the Bluff: The Limits of Trump\u2019s Negotiation Strategy"}
