{"source": "The New York Times", "text": "It\u2019s time to add Wells Fargo\u2019s chairman, Stephen W. Sanger, to the list of firings over the creation of millions of fake accounts. Just 56 percent of shareholders backed Mr. Sanger at the bank\u2019s annual meeting on Tuesday. That\u2019s a stinging rebuke for his failure as lead director. After 5,300 employees and the chief executive, John G. Stumpf, paid with their jobs, Mr. Sanger and other board members with lackluster support should go, too, to help the bank rehabilitate. Much of the nearly three-hour gathering in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. \u2014 clear across the country from Wells Fargo\u2019s San Francisco headquarters \u2014 felt like a full-blown airing of grievances. Investors, customers and employees past and present took turns denouncing executives and directors. Complaints went beyond the opening of at least two million unwanted bank and credit-card accounts by staff members aiming for aggressive sales goals. Also garnering controversy were mortgage foreclosures, equal pay for women and the decision to finance the Dakota Access Pipeline amid protests from Native Americans. The duping of customers dominated, however, with shareholder dissatisfaction coalescing around a dozen of the company\u2019s directors up for re-election. None of them secured more than 80 percent of the vote. Only the newcomers Karen Peetz, Ronald Sargent and Timothy J. Sloan, the chief executive, won nearly unanimous support. Mr. Sanger, the 71-year-old former boss of General Mills who took the chairman\u2019s seat when Mr. Stumpf departed, wasn\u2019t the only one to just squeak by. Although Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway voted its 10 percent stake in favor of the whole board, the directors Enrique Hernandez Jr., Federico F. Pe\u00f1a and Cynthia H. Milligan fell short of the 60 percent mark. Each leads or sits on one or more of the risk, governance and corporate responsibility committees. Five more directors failed to clear the 70 percent threshold that typically denotes a serious protest vote and which often forces companies to respond on such matters as \u201csay on pay.\u201d Not only does it suggest shareholders are displeased that board members were too slow to act, but also that the bank\u2019s internal investigation into the yearslong affair was too soft on them. Mr. Sanger called it a \u201cclear message of dissatisfaction\u201d that \u201cthe board has heard.\u201d The appropriate response now is for him and some of his colleagues to step down.", "title": "Wells Fargo Chairman Should Listen to Investors and Step Down", "abstract": "Stephen W.
