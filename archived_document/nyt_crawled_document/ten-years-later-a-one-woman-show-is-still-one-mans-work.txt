{"text": "Alerts sound about 10 times an hour on Kris Andersson\u2019s phone, but the multitasking performer may be keeping the paper industry in business, as well. Along with writing and starring in his solo show, \u201cDixie\u2019s Tupperware Party,\u201d Mr. Andersson has also been its booker, producer and promoter. And he does it all with a paper daily planner. Mr. Andersson never intended to write a play, let alone handle the business of one. It was a series of unexpected events and a friendly dare that started his evolution into Dixie Longate, a feisty redhead with a penchant for Jell-O shots and foul language who has toured the country for nearly a decade, peddling kitchen storage. \u201cDixie\u2019s Tupperware Party\u201d kicks off its 10th year on the road in May, with bookings set for the rest of the year \u2014 making Mr. Andersson one of the rare actors to parlay a single character into a career. Dixie came into being when Mr. Andersson\u2019s roommate hosted a Tupperware party at their Los Angeles home. A friend suggested that the actor start selling Tupperware himself; another friend dared him to do it in drag. Mr. Andersson accepted the challenge, borrowed a wig and boots and began his transformation into the raunchy and energetic traveling Tupperware saleswoman Dixie. \u201cIt was a completely horrible, haphazard look,\u201d he recalled, comparing the hairstyle to roadkill. \u201cI refined her over time.\u201d Tupperware sales skyrocketed, and a friend of Mr. Andersson\u2019s, the director Tomas Caruso, suggested he adapt the party into a stage show, which eventually had its premiere at the 2004 New York International Fringe Festival. He then spent a few years selling Tupperware \u2014 establishing himself, he said, as the No. 1 sales representative in both the United States and Canada \u2014 while developing the show. In 2007 he took up residence for three months at Ars Nova, an incubator for young talent that has gone on to help jump-start Bridget Everett, Billy Eichner and the current Broadway musical \u201cNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812.\u201d Dixie\u2019s Ars Nova engagement was directed by Alex Timbers, who later oversaw the innovative productions \u201cBloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\u201d and \u201cPeter and the Starcatcher,\u201d both of which transferred to Broadway after smaller-scale runs. Mr. Andersson took Dixie on tour in 2008, and with the help of booking and press agents, landed gigs for the next two years. He recalled: \u201dWhen the booking company said, \u2018It\u2019s looking like we\u2019re not going to book that much more,\u2019 I said, \u2018Great. I\u2019m going to take a shot at it.\u2019\u201d \u201cI thought, \u2018This can\u2019t be that hard,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cSomebody\u2019s a tour booker, a manager, an agent. They\u2019re not born with it. They go to school, they learn. If someone else can do it, I can do it.\u201d Multitasking is nothing new to Mr. Andersson. In fact, it\u2019s reminiscent of his childhood: He worked his first paper route when he was 8 and consistently held part-time jobs through his adolescence. Now, at 47, he is co-owner and co-producer of a production company called Down South, which he describes as \u201cthe umbrella of all things Dixie.\u201d What that means is hard work. For nine years, he has cold-called arts centers and performing arts spaces to get bookings. Some cities have been so welcoming that a sequel was called for in 2014: \u201cDixie\u2019s Never Wear a Tube Top While Riding a Mechanical Bull (And 16 Other Things I Learned While I Was Drinking Last Thursday)\u201d  does away with the Tupperware sales and dives into the character\u2019s personal life and philosophies. \u201cYou\u2019d think, 10 years in, that people know the show, it\u2019s easy to get in any market, and it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re one of the big, big shows, you\u2019re still constantly knocking on doors.\u201d Drag performances have inched closer to the mainstream since Mr. Andersson introduced Dixie, which cuts both ways. A one-man show with a set that can be packed into a Tupperware bin, \u201cDixie\u2019s Tupperware Party\u201d isn\u2019t costly to produce, and Mr. Andersson has worked determinedly to establish its name recognition. He knocked on doors in Nashville for four years until \u201cDixie\u201d was booked there. But despite a national presence, investors were reluctant to back Mr. Andersson for an Off Broadway run of \u201cDixie\u2019s Tupperware Party\u201d last September. He had hoped to bring the show, which has been updated since Ars Nova, back to New York. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t interested,\u201d he said. To expand his audience, Mr. Andersson recently signed with the Gersh Agency, where the agent Matt Charkow will help book \u201cDixie\u2019s Tupperware Party\u201d into new spaces. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to place the show outside of the standard theatrical model that Kris has been accustomed to,\u201d Mr. Charkow said. The coming tour includes one-night bookings along with lengthier runs at theaters, casinos and festivals. It cost $40,000 to produce \u201cDixie\u2019s Tupperware Party\u201d at Ars Nova for the three-month run, Mr. Andersson estimated, a total he \u201ccouldn\u2019t even imagine\u201d then. His touring advances at first totaled $25,000, but have grown over the years as high as $150,000 in a market. (His show runs about 90 minutes, and audiences can be as large as 1,500.) Now that he\u2019s signed with Gersh, Mr. Andersson is relieved to have some more time on his hands. In the past he would spend several weeks in one city cultivating his fan base; now the stops are shorter with more cities on the itinerary, a cross between theater and stand-up comedy gigs. Determined to stay relevant, Mr. Andersson interacts with fans through grass-roots marketing and social media. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for an agent to be out selling a show,\u201d Mr. Charkow said. \u201cIt\u2019s another to actually be the character, and be in the trenches, so to speak.\u201d It\u2019s the force of that character \u2014 who won\u2019t easily take no for an answer \u2014 that makes Mr. Charkow\u2019s job a little easier. \u201cShe\u2019s going to find her way to where she needs to go,\u201d he said, \u201cone way or another.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/theater/ten-years-later-a-one-woman-show-is-still-one-mans-work.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T08:00:26-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T08:00:26-04:00", "abstract": "Kris Andersson keeps on touring as Dixie Longate, an indefatigable Tupperware queen.", "title": "Ten Years Later, a One-Woman Show is Still One Man\u2019s Work"}
