{"text": "Bank chiefs are only human, but it might be better for investors if they didn\u2019t act it. James E. Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, vouched for his brother-in-law in a spat with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which is a client of the British bank. Though Mr. Staley\u2019s intervention is understandable, it is also the second time he has blurred what ought to be a clear line between life and work. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts bought a business in 2014 from Jorge Nitzan, then chief executive of the Brazilian data-center company Aceco TI, and later discovered accounting problems that it says were tantamount to fraud, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Mr. Staley told two large institutions that had invested alongside the private equity giant that he didn\u2019t believe Mr. Nitzan \u2014 his wife\u2019s brother \u2014 was a fraudster, according to The Journal. Barclays shareholders expect their chief executive to maintain a dialogue with large investors. But in an ideal world Mr. Staley would have declined to talk about Mr. Nitzan in a meeting, even informally. After all, the bank\u2019s brand goes where he does \u2014 even if he is only speaking personally. The same flaw was evident when Mr. Staley tried last year to unmask a whistle-blower who had made what he thought were unfair accusations against a colleague and friend. That was against the rules that protect whistle-blowers. No damage was done, as Mr. Staley failed to find out who had made the complaints about his pal. But he conceded he had gotten \u201ctoo personally involved,\u201d and lost a chunk of his bonus as a result. For Barclays employees and investors, the conflict is not entirely unflattering. Loyalty and fairness are virtues in a boss. That has limits, though. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts could pull away business, and it has already excluded Barclays from some mandates. Other opportunistic clients might also try to use Mr. Staley\u2019s track record of imperfect judgment to their own ends. If a tendency to elide the personal and professional make him a target, investors might prefer someone a little less human.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/business/barclays-james-staley-kohlberg-kravis-roberts.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T14:55:30-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T14:55:30-04:00", "abstract": "While the interventions by James E.
