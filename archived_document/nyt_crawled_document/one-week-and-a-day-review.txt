{"text": "\u201cOne Week and a Day,\u201d a wan movie about an Israeli couple dealing with loss, tries for a difficult balance, but it isn\u2019t sharp enough to be funny or profound enough to be touching. It meanders from start to finish, searching for a tone that it never quite finds. As the movie opens, Eyal (Shai Avivi) and Vicky (Evgenia Dodina) have just reached the end of the shiva for their son, whom we learn almost nothing about. Eyal in particular is having trouble with how to mourn and with moving on. He doesn\u2019t want to go to the grave site and fails, despite Vicky\u2019s repeated reminders, to tend to the task of securing the plots next to their son so they can someday be buried there. The most pronounced manifestation of Eyal distress, though, is that he decides to try marijuana, with the help of a nutty neighbor, Zooler (Tomer Kapon). The sight of an older adult getting stoned hasn\u2019t been funny or original for years, but Asaph Polonsky, who wrote and directed the film, won\u2019t let it go. This would have been a better movie had some of that time been devoted to Vicky, who is having her own problems dealing with the death and also seems to be the more interesting half of this couple.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/one-week-and-a-day-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:18:06-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:18:06-04:00", "abstract": "An Israeli couple lose a son and have some trouble finding a path back to normalcy.", "title": "Review: In \u2018One Week and a Day,\u2019 Grief and Goofiness"}
