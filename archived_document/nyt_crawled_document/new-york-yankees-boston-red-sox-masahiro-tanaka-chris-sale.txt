{"text": "BOSTON \u2014 Gary Sanchez began terrorizing the American League last August but three months before that, in May, he made one appearance in the starting lineup \u2014 as the designated hitter against Chris Sale. It was not a pleasant experience. Sanchez went hitless, his last at-bat a weak grounder for the final out of Sale\u2019s complete-game victory over the Yankees. The next morning, Sanchez was sent back to the minors, where he remained for another 10 weeks. But Sanchez was hardly the only Yankee in recent seasons to find Sale almost impossible to solve. Such is his sway over the Yankees that it left them discomfited when he was traded by the Chicago White Sox over the winter and landed as the instant ace of the Yankees\u2019 biggest rival, the Boston Red Sox. On Thursday night, the Yankees got their first taste of Sale as an American League East fixture, and in an extraordinary effort they outdid him, with Masahiro Tanaka delivering a three-hit shutout to beat the Red Sox, 3-0. It was the first complete game for a Yankee since Tanaka did it on Aug. 5, 2015, against Toronto. It was also a sprint by the laborious standard of Red Sox-Yankees battles, with the game finishing in 2 hours 21 minutes \u2014 the fastest game in this rivalry since May 6, 1994. Matt Holliday, who was mired in a 2-for-21 slump entering the game, drove in two runs \u2014 the first with a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning, and the other with a single in the ninth, when the Yankees pushed across their final two runs against a tiring Sale. If Tanaka was not as dominant or electric as Sale, he was more efficient. He also burnished his reputation as a competitor who often rises to the occasion. Tanaka, who was rocked in the season opener at Tampa Bay, getting knocked out in the third inning, steadily improved in his next three starts. And he was at his best on Thursday, allowing no walks while striking out three. Tanaka allowed just one runner into scoring position \u2014 Hanley Ramirez, who led off the second with a single, advanced to second on a groundout and stayed put when Tanaka retired Xander Bogaerts on a fly ball and Jackie Bradley Jr. on a groundout. It was the type of performance the Yankees may need regularly against Sale, who allowed eight singles and no walks and struck out 10. He gave up only an unearned run until the ninth. Sale entered Thursday with a 1.17 earned run average against the Yankees, the lowest by any pitcher with at least 50 innings against them, according to Elias Sports Bureau. The Red Sox stunned baseball by trading four prospects to the White Sox for Sale. It was also the type of trade the Yankees once would have gone all in to make. But the Yankees have become disciplined in holding onto their latest generation of prospects, resisting overtures since the trade deadline two years ago. The consequence is that the Yankees have had to watch Boston and Toronto swing deals and sign big-ticket free-agent pitchers like Sale and David Price. \u201cHere we go again,\u201d Chase Headley said, when asked for his initial reaction to the Sale trade. \u201cI guess that\u2019s just the nature of the A.L. East. It\u2019s very competitive, and there\u2019s somebody that\u2019s going for it pretty much every year. Right now, it\u2019s the Red Sox. When you hear of a player of that caliber being available, you always hope he comes to your team \u2014 or goes somewhere that\u2019s not in your division. But it\u2019s out of your control, so you just roll with the punches and do the best you can.\u201d General Manager Brian Cashman has said since the end of last season that the Yankees were not far enough along in their rebuilding process to be in a back-up-the-truck-with-prospects mode to pursue a player like Sale. Asked Thursday if he might have acted differently last winter if he knew the Yankees would play as well as they have this season, Cashman made it clear the price would have been high. The Red Sox parted with their top two prospects, and the Yankees would have had to do the same. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have what I have on the field now, all those guys you\u2019re loving now,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cYou\u2019d rob Peter to pay Paul.\u201d Against Sale on Thursday, the Yankees\u2019 offensive output was patched together. Aaron Hicks led off the fourth with a looping single to right. He took second when Sale knocked down a comebacker by Headley, and Hicks advanced to third on a passed ball. A line drive to left field by Holliday easily scored Hicks. The Yankees advanced only one other runner into scoring position until the ninth. At that point, they finally gave Tanaka some margin for error when Hicks and Headley singled before Holliday rifled a single off the Green Monster and advanced to second on a throw home that could not nail Hicks. Sale was then lifted for Heath Hembree, who gave up a run-scoring single to Starlin Castro before retiring the side. Then it was Tanaka\u2019s turn to finish outdoing Sale.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/sports/new-york-yankees-boston-red-sox-masahiro-tanaka-chris-sale.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T22:47:14-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T22:47:14-04:00", "abstract": "Tanaka threw a three-hitter in the first complete game for a Yankee since he had one in August 2015, and Matt Holliday drove in two runs to help defeat Boston.", "title": "Yankees\u2019 Masahiro Tanaka Shuts Out Red Sox and Beats Chris Sale"}
