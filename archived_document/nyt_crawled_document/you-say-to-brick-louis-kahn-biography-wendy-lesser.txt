Kahn gave us a remarkable string of masterpieces that includes the Salk Institute and the Kimbell Art Museum, and yet he was one of those shambling geniuses whose life was a mess of contradictions. While his commissions took him around the world, he managed to maintain three separate families at home in Philadelphia. He had a reputation for blowing deadlines and budgets, testing the patience of clients. No one was surprised to learn after his death in 1974 that his firm was deep in debt. The turmoil of his life came to overshadow his accomplishments. The situation began to reverse in 2003 with the success of his son\u2019s deeply moving documentary, \u201cMy Architect.\u201d The film traces Nathaniel Kahn\u2019s efforts to connect with his father and two half-siblings during a tour of the architect\u2019s buildings. The glorious footage \u2014 sunbeams filtering through the National Assembly in Bangladesh, the Salk silhouetted against the Pacific Ocean \u2014 rekindled interest in Kahn\u2019s work. His rising stock has brought a shelf\u2019s worth of monographs. While one or two might be categorized as biographies, Wendy Lesser\u2019s \u201cYou Say to Brick\u201d is easily the most complete narrative of Kahn\u2019s life and career, magnificently researched and gracefully written. As the founder of The Threepenny Review and a nonfictionnofiction author, Lesser has a background that\u2019s literary, yet her account is packed with insights, of both the architectural and psychological kind. Kahn\u2019s best buildings leave visitors with the same heart-quickening sensation as an ancient Greek temple. They also changed architectural history. His soulful, sculptural designs helped lift the profession out of its functionalist, placeless, modernist rut. But there is no denying that his tangled personal life is the thing that makes Kahn\u2019s story so irresistible. Besides his wife, Esther, Kahn had long relationships with two much-younger women in his office, Anne Tyng and Harriet Pattison. Lesser also details a previously unreported affair with another architect in his office, Marie Kuo, and suggests there were flings on the side as well. Lesser\u2019s other big reveal is that Esther Kahn also engaged in a long extramarital relationship. Even in the martini-drinking Eisenhower era, when such womanizing was seen as acceptable male prerogative, Kahn\u2019s behavior was shocking stuff. Still, Kahn hardly fits the profile of a successful Lothario. Born Leiser-Itze Schmulowsky in Estonia, in 1901, Kahn moved with his family to the United States when he was 5, and he grew up desperately poor in North Philadelphia. A childhood accident left his face as stippled as the rough concrete of the Salk\u2019s walls. He was short and often disheveled from all-nighters at the drafting table. Yet women and men alike were mesmerized by his vigor and poetic brilliance. A charming mystic, he was given to anthropomorphizing architectural elements. The title, \u201cYou Say to Brick,\u201d is one of his classics. Kahn was also a romantic, and his relationships with Tyng and Pattison were true love affairs. After each woman became pregnant, Kahn did his flawed best to be a supportive father, commuting among his three households. While Kahn was absent for long stretches, his children \u2014 Sue Ann Kahn, Alexandra Tyng and Nathaniel Kahn \u2014 have loving memories of him. Whatever bitterness Kahn\u2019s families harbored, their commitment to him never wavered. Neither Anne Tyng nor Harriet Pattison ever married. And how\u2019s this for complex family dynamics: Alex Tyng wrote her dissertation on her father\u2019s work, then ended up marrying his grandnephew. Nathaniel devoted years to making \u201cMy Architect.\u201d For Kahn, there was never a line between love and work, and Lesser effectively shows how each of his long-term relationships was crucial to his development as an architect. Esther supported him financially during the Depression, when he struggled to get his career started. Part of what makes Kahn such a heroic, literary character (and what should give us all heart) is that he didn\u2019t hit his stride until he was in his 50s. That also happens to be when the affairs with Tyng and Pattison began. Compared with the output of a protean force like Frank Lloyd Wright, Kahn\u2019s body of work is tiny, and by Lesser\u2019s estimation includes just 14 great buildings. Nearly all were designed in the last two decades of his life, an intense period that began in 1950 after a three-month architect\u2019s residency in Rome opened his eyes to the monumental power of ancient, masonry buildings. \u201cMass and weight became especially important to him during this period,\u201d Lesser writes. \u201cKahn began to envision a way in which his deep-seated affection for the old and his admiration for the new could come together.\u201d Tyng\u2019s contribution to Kahn\u2019s development has long been recognized, if grudgingly, but Lesser portrays their early projects as collaborations between equals. Tyng, one of the first women to earn an architecture degree from Harvard, introduced a rigorous, mathematical approach to their designs. Her obsession with geometry gave the Yale Art Gallery its most distinctive feature, a dropped ceiling that looks something like a fishnet petrified in concrete. Not only does the decorative treatment bring the plain interior to life, the diamond openings also shield an overhead cavity that houses the wiring and ducts. While standard today, setting aside a dedicated channel for the building\u2019s infrastructure was an important functional innovation, one that would lead Kahn to make such segregated \u201cserved\u201d and \u201cservant\u201d spaces a hallmark of his designs. Vincent Scully, the influential Yale art historian, would go on to praise the museum for its \u201cmasculinity.\u201d Its huge critical success raised Kahn\u2019s profile and paved the way for the commissions that made him famous. Never much of a writer or theorist, Kahn spoke instead in thick black pencil strokes. He often drew as he talked, and he talked a lot. As his vision for infusing buildings with ancient gravitas cohered, Kahn sought collaborators who could help make his groundbreaking citadels a reality. Maybe the biggest surprise Lesser recounts is that the Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n was the one who proposed the format for the Salk plaza overlooking the Pacific. More than any other element in Kahn\u2019s work, the plaza\u2019s long perspective view, which suggests you are peering into infinity, sums up his struggle to embed architecture with a sense of the eternal. God is in the details, as Mies van der Rohe reportedly claimed, but Kahn\u2019s architecture is more than just details. His buildings are works of art that need to be experienced by a human body moving through space to be fully understood. Lesser does readers a service by interspersing her narrative with \u201cIn Situ\u201d chapters that serve as guides to his designs and vividly conjure the experience of walking through his buildings. Only by such direct experience, she writes, \u201ccan you perceive ... how many observations about light and shadow and weight and transcendence it is making.\u201d It took years of sketching and talking and thinking for Kahn to learn how to render those observations in brick and concrete. The Philadelphia mystic had finally achieved understanding when he suffered a fatal heart attack in the windowless dungeon of New York\u2019s Penn Station. A series of mix-ups caused his body to be sent to the missing persons section of the city morgue. Although Kahn was the foremost architect of his time, two days would pass before his family and the world learned of his death. Kahn died far from the light. With Lesser\u2019s biography, the illumination is restored.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T06:00:25-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/you-say-to-brick-louis-kahn-biography-wendy-lesser.html", "item_type": "Article"}
