The judge, William H. Orrick of United States District Court for the Northern District of California, issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the administration, directing it to stop trying to cut off aid to sanctuary jurisdictions. But the order does not prevent the federal government from moving forward on designating certain places as \u201csanctuaries,\u201d nor does it keep the administration from enforcing conditions for doling out federal money if they already exist, as the Justice Department has already begun to do with some law enforcement grants. San Francisco and Santa Clara County, which had asked the judge for an injunction, \u201chave a strong interest in avoiding unconstitutional federal enforcement and the significant budget uncertainty that has resulted from the Order\u2019s broad and threatening language,\u201d the judge wrote, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s January executive order on immigration.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/us/judge-blocks-trump-sanctuary-cities.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T17:05:21-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "Judge Blocks Trump Effort to Withhold Money From Sanctuary Cities", "item_type": "Article"}
