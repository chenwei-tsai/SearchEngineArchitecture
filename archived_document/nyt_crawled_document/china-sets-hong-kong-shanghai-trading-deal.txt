{"text": "HONG KONG \u2014 It was a seven-year wait, but China on Thursday finally announced a plan to allow two-way investment between the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges. For the first time, individual investors in Hong Kong will be able to use their local brokerage accounts to trade the shares of companies listed in Shanghai, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission said in a joint announcement on Thursday. At the same time, investors in mainland China would be able to use their local brokers to buy Hong Kong-listed shares. This outbound trading would be restricted to institutions or individual investors whose accounts have a minimum of 500,000 renminbi, or about $80,500. The combined daily trading would be capped at 23.5 billion renminbi, the regulators said. That is equal to about 20 percent of the combined average daily trading turnover of both markets. Despite their size and huge trading volumes, China\u2019s equity and debt markets remain largely off limits to foreign investors. Two-way investment is restricted to licensed institutions and subject to comparatively tiny quotas. The preparatory work to introduce the new pilot trading program is expected to take about six months, officials said. The cumulative, combined trading flows will be capped at an aggregate 550 billion renminbi. The quotas may be adjusted in the future, the regulators said. The program, called the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, \u201cwill not only help strengthen the two securities markets, but will also have long-term and strategic significance,\u201d John Tsang, Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary, said in a statement. \u201cI am pleased to see that Hong Kong plays an important role in the two-way opening up of the mainland\u2019s capital market to the world.\u201d In the summer of 2007, senior Hong Kong government officials announced a plan, referred to as the \u201cthrough train,\u201d that would allow mainland Chinese investors to directly buy shares listed in Hong Kong. That announcement sent the local Hang Seng index soaring, gaining more than 50 percent over a two-month period ending in October 2007 to peak at a high of over 31,000 points. But the through train never left the station. Hong Kong stocks plunged and, unlike shares in the United States and other major markets, have not come close to matching their pre-crisis highs. Investors are hoping this time around is different. \u201cThe landmark agreement gives global investors greater access to China\u2019s extraordinary growth story and allows Chinese savers to diversify their holdings,\u201d said Peter Wong, the deputy chairman and chief executive of HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong unit. \u201cThis is further confirmation of China\u2019s commitment to financial reform, and reaffirms Hong Kong\u2019s role as the fulcrum of China\u2019s broader economic integration with the global economy.\u201d Opening up China\u2019s financial markets to the world is a central goal of the package of overhauls announced by President Xi Jinping after a major plenum meeting of Communist Party leaders in November. Beyond allowing greater access to China\u2019s stock markets, other proposals include easing the state\u2019s heavy-handed control of bank deposit rates, currency exchange rates and the banking sector. But critics say China has yet to implement some of the promised liberalizations, as has been demonstrated, for example, by slow progress in developing new or planned free trade zones. It appeared on Thursday that significant details of the stock trading program remain to be worked out. For example, the announcement by the two regulators said the proposal would enable \u201cmainland investors to directly participate in the Hong Kong stock market using RMB,\u201d using the abbreviation for renminbi, the Chinese currency. But Hong Kong trading is carried out using the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the dollar and \u2014 unlike the renminbi \u2014 is a freely convertible currency. Almost no Hong Kong stocks trade in renminbi. Two notable exceptions are Hui Xian Real Estate Investment Trust, controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing, and Hopewell Highway Infrastructure, a toll-road operator that maintains a dual-currency listing. At the same time, the regulators said that shares in more than 200 Hong Kong companies would be open to mainland investment under the program. That appeared to imply that either mainland investors would be allowed to freely convert their renminbi into hard currency, or that the Hong Kong companies targeted for investment would need to conduct a secondary offering of renminbi-denominated shares. Regarding the division of trading quotas, the two regulators said that \u201csouthbound\u201d investment from the mainland to Hong Kong would be capped at 10.5 billion renminbi a day, while \u201cnorthbound\u201d investment from Hong Kong to China would be capped at 13 billion renminbi, both monitored on a \u201creal time\u201d basis. Securities regulation and the legal system vary considerably between Hong Kong and mainland China, and the regulators said they would work together on a framework that would \u201crespond to all misconduct in either or both markets on a timely basis.\u201d Markets welcomed Thursday\u2019s news. The Hang Seng index closed 1.51 percent higher, while the Shanghai composite index gained 1.38 percent for the day.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/business/international/china-sets-hong-kong-shanghai-trading-deal.html", "published_date": "2014-04-09T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T14:03:40-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T14:03:40-04:00", "abstract": "China has announced a plan, seven years in the making, to allow two-way investment between the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges.", "title": "China Sets Hong Kong-Shanghai Trading Deal"}
