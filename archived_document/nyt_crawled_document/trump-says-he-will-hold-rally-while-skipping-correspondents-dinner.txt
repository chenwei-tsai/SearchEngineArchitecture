In a Twitter message Saturday morning, the president said he would be \u201cholding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania\u201d on April 29, the same night the press corps will be gathering for its annual black-tie event at the Washington Hilton. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision is another thumb-in-the-eye to the White House press corps after months of tension and acrimony between the president and the reporters who cover him. Mr. Trump has called several news organizations \u201cfake\u201d or the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and repeatedly said The New York Times is \u201cfailing.\u201d After the president announced in February that he would not attend the dinner, the White House indicated that none of his staff would attend, \u201cin solidarity\u201d with their boss \u2014 a move that was widely interpreted as an order by Mr. Trump that they should not go to the dinner. The dinner has for decades been attended by sitting presidents and scores of administration officials. In recent years, it has become a destination for A-list celebrities and has raised money for scholarships that the correspondents\u2019 association gives to aspiring student journalists. Instead, Mr. Trump will use the evening to trumpet his administration\u2019s early accomplishments at the rally. April 29 is the president\u2019s 100th day in office, a milestone that Mr. Trump mocked as \u201cridiculous\u201d in a Twitter post on Friday.", "section": "U.S.", "title": "Trump Says He Will Hold Rally While Skipping Correspondents\u2019 Dinner", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/us/politics/trump-says-he-will-hold-rally-while-skipping-correspondents-dinner.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T13:43:51-04:00", "published_date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T13:43:51-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
