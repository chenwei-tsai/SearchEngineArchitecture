{"text": "When Steve Stollman talks about the energy that once pulsed around the intersection of Houston and Mulberry Streets, he is not indulging some touchy-feely sensibility (even if he did make a living in the 1960s distributing hippie-friendly underground newspapers). He\u2019s being literal. In the late 19th century, before this neighborhood in Manhattan was called NoLIta, Nikola Tesla had a laboratory on Houston Street, where he conducted experiments on electricity that challenged his onetime employer, Thomas Alva Edison. Granted, Mr. Stollman is partial to rebels who upset the status quo, a sentiment that guided the activities in his storefront at 49 East Houston Street, which he occupied from 1974 until selling it to developers in 2008. He advocated for and built newsstands for blind and disabled veterans. He amassed a collection of old issues of Puck magazine, the satirical publication that was published in the area and took on the corrupt politicians and corporate monopolies of the Gilded Age. And he let bike groups and other activists use his ramshackle space for meetings and as a gathering point for group rides (that were often monitored by dozens of police officers). In homage to that spirit, he has plastered portraits and cartoons on the blue fence that guards the empty lot where his building once stood. The display honors Tesla and his friend Mark Twain; Joseph Keppler, the immigrant who founded Puck magazine; Jacob Riis, the crusading photographer; and Theodore Roosevelt, who as police commissioner had his office a few blocks away. Some of them knew each other, but each in his own way challenged the status quo. His ad hoc pantheon is a tribute to the area\u2019s forgotten history and a call to arms in a neighborhood that has been supercharged by gentrification and luxury development, like the Puck Building, which is owned by the family of the real estate mogul Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. That call is summed up in a meditation Mr. Stollman wrote: \u201cNow that we have entered a new Gilded Age, or perhaps more accurately a Shiny Brass-Plated Age, the need to find the current heroes, to soften the blows of so much inequality, danger to our futures and corrosion of our values, becomes ever more critical.\u201d Had things gone as expected when he sold the building for $5.5 million in 2008, he would have returned to the area and occupied a ground-floor space to continue his work with various community groups. He said the new owner, Michael Hirtenstein, had agreed to the suggestion but reneged, leaving the site empty. Litigation followed, which led to another recent offer from Mr. Hirtenstein that gave him until Sept. 15 to find a new buyer willing to pay at least $15 million for the property. Mr. Stollman is to get half of anything above $11 million. If not, Mr. Stollman gets $1.6 million and walks away (or takes the train upstate, where he now lives with his partner, Melissa Miller). Neither Mr. Hirtenstein nor his lawyer would comment on the arrangement. Given the area\u2019s extreme makeover, it\u2019s hard to find traces of its recent past, much less the 19th century. When Mr. Stollman arrived on the block in 1974, the city was going broke \u2014 and looked it. \u201cIt was the Bowery, skid row,\u201d said Mr. Stollman, 74. \u201cIt was a classic New York tenement neighborhood. You had people sleeping in front of the place, a candy store run by a nice Italian couple, and a restaurant owned by John Ballato, who was in the movie \u2018Reds.\u2019 Limos would pull up to this little restaurant and out came movie stars who stepped over bodies to get in.\u201d Well, at least celebrities still flock to the area. Mr. Stollman is unsure who might buy the property, though he just put up a sign in Chinese hoping to attract buyers who want to be near Chinatown. And while he had long hoped to return to the area, he admits too much time may have passed. \u201cWhen I sold this, the neighborhood was an active one, with activism very much part of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cBut gentrification in this part of Manhattan over the last eight years has just been fierce. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to come back. The energy that was there is gone.\u201d While it may not help him court big money, he would like his sidewalk display \u2014 and planned nighttime projections \u2014 to suggest that perhaps a new era of activism is called for in the Trump age. \u201cIn the late 1800s people didn\u2019t give a damn about each other, and it was cold,\u201d Mr. Stollman said. \u201cBut Tesla and the others talked about humanity and brought forth ideas that gave people more fulfilling lives. They represented important ideas. Each of them did a lot to have people live better lives and be closer together, all within the same area. Yet today nobody know what Puck was, and they think Tesla is just a car.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/nyregion/in-nolita-a-tribute-to-forgotten-history.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T12:01:26-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T12:01:26-04:00", "abstract": "A former business owner from Houston and Mulberry Streets would love to bring back the spirit of a neighborhood where Nikola Tesla once had a lab.", "title": "In NoLIta, a Tribute to Forgotten History"}
