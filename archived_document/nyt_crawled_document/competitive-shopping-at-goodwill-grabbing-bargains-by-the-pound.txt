{"text": "On a recent afternoon, in a warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, three dozen people assembled behind a strip of tape fixed like a starting line to the concrete floor. Some had burlap sacks tied around their waists to free up their arms; others wore gloves. A manager placed his hands on his hips, and with all the energy of an exhausted school principal, he addressed the line: \u201cNo running, no pushing, no fighting, understand?\u201d He shot pointed looks at a few people. \u201cNo throwing clothes on the floor.\u201d He repeated the message in Spanish, and stood aside. The group race-walked past him, toward a few dozen bins covered by sheets and blankets, and as they threw off the covers and descended on the clothes inside, their cries echoed through the space. \u201cThis one\u2019s got nothing.\u201d \u201cAy, Dios m\u00edo!\u201d This is a regular routine \u2014 it takes place several times a day, when a new batch of merchandise is wheeled out \u2014 at the Goodwill Outlet, a warehouse with a 9,000-square-foot sales floor where items donated to Goodwill end up if they fail to sell at New York City\u2019s 14 Goodwill stores. The clothing here is cheaper than at the stores and sold in bulk \u2014 $1.69 per pound for the first 20 pounds, with prices dropping from there. Much of it is also of high quality, reflecting the city\u2019s prosperity and its fickleness. And since the Goodwill Outlet opened, in 2009, it has become a destination for fashion bloggers, buyers from vintage stores, thrifty families \u2014 and, outnumbering every other group, dozens of immigrants who buy and resell the clothes in their communities, and their home countries. \u201cConverse, Banana, Express,\u201d said Araceli Infante, a 40-year-old mother of two, listing the brand names she often finds. \u201cNice clothes, dresses, sometimes with tags.\u201d Ms. Infante, like many regular shoppers at the outlet, comes from the Dominican Republic. For decades, Dominican immigrants have supplied sellers in their native country with pre-owned clothing bought in the United States, which is then sold from people\u2019s homes, or from stalls outside their homes. She said she had helped support her family for the past three years by shipping boxes of clothes purchased at the Goodwill Outlet to people in Santo Domingo. She sold boxes containing 200 articles of clothing for about $450 each. The name-brand items were then sold piece by piece. \u201cEverything sells\u201d as long as it is unused, she said in Spanish, adding, \u201cFrom a panty to a sock.\u201d In 2016, according to Goodwill Industries, the New York and New Jersey operation diverted 128 million pounds of items from landfills, up from 117 million pounds the year before. Merchandise arrives at the outlet from the Goodwill stores via truck three or four times a day. Its shelf-life is brief. In the stores, items, which go for about $5 to $40, have a week or two to find a home. In the outlet, they have a day. What does not sell in one day at the outlet is baled and sold by the ton to textile recyclers. (Nonclothing items are sold to salvage.) Some shoppers come a long way to buy clothes. Kenia Almanzar, 63, said she traveled to the United States from the Dominican Republic once a month to shop at the outlet and at similar ones in New Jersey and Connecticut. Ms. Almanzar said that she used to sell new clothes, but that after struggling with taxes imposed on small businesses she closed her shop and began reselling Americans\u2019 discarded clothing. Next to the outlet is an Indoor Extreme Sports center, where people play paintball and zombie laser tag. What happens at the outlet can sometimes resemble an indoor extreme sport. \u201cWhen the covers come off, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s every man for themselves,\u201d said Jonathan Love, 29, who came to the outlet looking for vintage clothes he would sell on Instagram. \u201cPeople go in and they dig and they just throw. I\u2019ve had a shoe fly past my head. I\u2019ve learned to just stand back and let the crazy happen.\u201d Higinio Flores, 80, the father of one of the Dominican women, sat waiting while his daughter shopped. \u201cThey get into it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey fight, but they don\u2019t get physical.\u201d The fights, according to regulars, arise from dueling factions. \u201cThere\u2019s a group that dominates us,\u201d Ms. Infante said. She pointed out a cluster of Dominican women whom she identified as the old-timers at the outlet. She said that last year, after the management let customers use sacks and plastic bags instead of just draping the clothes over their arms, the women started hoarding. They would grab clothes by the armful and would later gather in a corner to cherry-pick the best items. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re very pushy,\u201d Ms. Infante said. \u201cThey come ready to fight. The weaker of us can\u2019t get in and get anything.\u201d She added, \u201cI used to get 50 or 60 pounds, now I\u2019m getting 20 or 15.\u201d she said. Women in the faction she pointed out declined to be interviewed. Asked about fighting, the manager, Sal Ciniglio, shook his head, a smile playing on his lips, and said, \u201cNo comment.\u201d He added, \u201cWe run a safe store.\u201d In response to the competition, Ms. Infante said, \u201cwe joined forces.\u201d She gestured to a woman folding a jade-colored Moschino top. The two Dominican women, who had met at the outlet, often left together, wheeling their bulging suitcases to the subway. Immigrants from several other countries frequent the warehouse, too. Claudia Romero, from Puebla, Mexico, held up a brand-new workout tank-top that said, \u201cI Love Sweat,\u201d and gave a thumbs-up. Two middle-aged women from Morocco wearing head scarves looked with curiosity at a pair of red suede platforms with a five-inch heel. One woman, from Ecuador, declined to be interviewed at the Goodwill outlet but spoke later by telephone. She said a small number of Ecuadorean and Mexican immigrants were among the regulars, but the Dominicans were the unofficial rulers of the outlet. The woman said she sold clothes to friends, but her main customers were the Dominican women themselves, to whom she sold items for a small profit. Despite the cliques, the regulars called each other by name and went to the management to resolve disputes. On a typical day, the biggest complaints were someone plucking an item from someone else\u2019s cart or finding a beautiful shoe forever parted from its mate. But there were moments of drama. Recently, one of the Dominican women\u2019s purses disappeared, distracted as she was, looking through the bins. Inside it were her Social Security card and residency documents. She stood between bins crying. Another afternoon, a young man arrived at the outlet hoping to find two containers of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s things. He said he had reacted badly when he found out she was involved with somebody new. So he said he went around his apartment looking for things that reminded him of his old love. People do rash things in crisis. He donated them to Goodwill. When he told her, offhandedly, she was furious. He rushed back to his local Goodwill store. An employee said that the containers had either been sold or taken to the outlet. When he arrived at the gigantic warehouse in Queens, his heart sank. There were several bins for pillows alone. Mr. Ciniglio checked in back, and came back with a scowl on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d he said, trying to find a comforting word. After the last batch of the day was wheeled out, once the initial frenzy died down, the customers settled into searching through the remainders \u2014 pulling a sweater from a heap, throwing it back, untangling slacks. A song came over the speakers, and quietly, then more loudly, many of the shoppers began singing \u2014 the immigrant women, the vintage store owners, three recent college grads in all-thrift outfits. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll find someone like you,\u201d they sang, speaking the universal language of Adele. \u201cI wish nothing but the best for you too.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/competitive-shopping-at-goodwill-grabbing-bargains-by-the-pound.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T07:00:30-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T07:00:30-04:00", "abstract": "What doesn\u2019t sell at New York stores ends up at the nonprofit\u2019s outlet, where throngs wait for their chance to claim the goods.", "title": "Competitive Shopping at Goodwill, Grabbing Bargains by the Pound"}
