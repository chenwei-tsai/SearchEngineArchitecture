Warthen was looking ahead four hitters, at Curtis Granderson, with optimism. The bullpen would be ready, Warthen said, \u201cwhen Grandy ties this up.\u201d It was not entirely wishful thinking. Granderson has averaged 25 home runs a season in his first three years as a Met. \u201cThat\u2019s the thought process here,\u201d Collins said after the game. \u201cWe know we got guys who can hit the ball over the fence.\u201d That thought process might make sense, but on Saturday it was more like wishful thinking. Not only did Granderson never get to the plate \u2014 the Mets went down in order in the ninth to lose, 3-1, and put themselves in position to be swept by their chief National League East competition in the series finale Sunday night \u2014 but the Mets had not hit much of anything against Nationals starter Gio Gonzalez and three relievers at Citi Field. In fact, the Mets were hitless for eight of the game\u2019s nine innings and, if not for two sixth-inning singles, would have been no-hit for the ninth time. And the listless Mets can hardly be looking forward to Sunday night, when they will face Max Scherzer, the last pitcher to hold them hitless, on the second-to-last day of the 2015 season. \u201cI don\u2019t have any answers for you,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not hitting.\u201d One reason is that the Mets, a team that lives by the home run despite playing in a not-so-hitter-friendly park, are injury-depleted and without two of their top home run threats: Lucas Duda, who is on the 10-day disabled list with an elbow injury, and Yoenis Cespedes, who missed his second straight game with what the club called a hamstring cramp. He is most likely to miss at least one more game on Sunday. \u201cI would love to have him tomorrow, as much as I\u2019d love to have Duda,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut I doubt I will. It\u2019s just something we have to deal with.\u201d Collins said Cespedes, who led the Mets with 31 home runs last season, spent most of the game either in the trainer\u2019s room or getting a massage so that he might work out the pain in his left leg. And when Collins asked him for an at-bat in hope of sparking the Mets\u2019 moribund offense, Cespedes said he could not give it to him. \u201cHe said, \u2018I just don\u2019t think I can hit tonight,\u2019\u201d Collins said. Collins\u2019s only real option on the bench was Jose Reyes, who has been futile at the plate so far this season (6 for 62, .097). Before the game, Collins decided it was better for Reyes not only not to play, but not to do anything \u2014 no batting practice, no swings in the cage and no infield practice \u2014 rather than risk falling deeper into his funk with another unsuccessful day at the plate. Reyes, pinch-hitting for the pitcher in the sixth inning, drew a walk that started the Mets\u2019 only mini-rally of the day, as singles by Juan Lagares and Asdrubal Cabrera produced their lone run of the game. But after Cabrera drove in Reyes, the final 11 Mets went down in order, dropping the club\u2019s record to 8-10 \u2014 its worst start since 2011 \u2014 and pushing it to four and a half games behind the Nationals in the division. \u201cThere\u2019s no panic here,\u201d Jay Bruce said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those times. There\u2019s going to be a lot of winning baseball to be played, and we\u2019re going to play it.\u201d The loss, the Mets\u2019 seventh in their last eight games and the fourth of the five played so far in a nine-game homestand, was hardly the fault of starter Jacob deGrom, who had a strange outing. DeGrom (0-1) struck out 10, inducing the Nationals to swing and miss 27 times \u2014 the most in his career \u2014 but also issued a career-high six walks in five and two-thirds innings. It was a performance good enough to keep most any team in the game, especially one that had already hit 27 home runs, the second-most in Major League Baseball. But Nationals pitchers Gonzalez, Blake Treinen, Enny Romero and Koda Glover were better. The outcome was a loss that only magnified the importance of Sunday\u2019s series finale in Collins\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s huge, huge,\u201d Collins said, in what might seem like a curious statement fewer than 20 games into a 162-game season. But as Bruce pointed out, the season will not be young much longer. \u201cIt\u2019s only April,\u201d he said, \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to be April forever. We need to start playing well, and I\u2019m confident that we will.\u201d", "title": "Listless Mets Drop Another One to the Nationals", "item_type": "Article", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/sports/baseball/new-york-mets-philadelphia-phillies-score.html"}
