{"text": "Good morning.  Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 A recent threat of a nuclear strike from North Korea, combined with President Trump\u2019s unpredictable foreign policy, are fueling a national debate in Australia about the country\u2019s relationship with the world.

Since 1991, the event has highlighted the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the food industry. Long before the concept of celebrity chefs, James Beard was hailed as a \u201ckitchen wizard\u201d and the \u201cdean of the American cookery.\u201d Born in Portland, Ore., he dropped out of college and studied voice and theater in Europe. But back in the U.S., acting didn\u2019t pay the bills, so he turned to catering and teaching clients how to cook and serve dinners \u201cin an international manner.\u201d By 1955, he founded a cooking school in New York with a basic course of six lessons: crepes and sauces, souffl\u00e9s, omelets, bread making, oven cookery and preparing a complete dinner party. More than 20 cookbooks, a pioneering TV show and a stream of formative critiques followed, paving the way for chefs like Julia Child and Marcella Hazan. He died in 1985. He professed an \u201cincurable addiction to fine caviar\u201d and was equally enamored of buttered new potatoes (though he eventually gave up the butter for health reasons). \u201cThe secret of good cooking,\u201d Mr. Beard said, \u201cis first having a love of it.\u201d Remy Tumin contributed reporting. _____ This briefing was prepared for the Australian morning.
