{"text": "In the middle of Handel\u2019s \u201cAriodante,\u201d the title character makes an uncomfortably convincing case for suicide. On Sunday, the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, singing the role in a concert performance of the opera with the conductor Harry Bicket and his English Concert chamber orchestra, held Carnegie Hall\u2019s audience in thrall for nearly nine minutes as she wrung every bit of emotion from this music. In this long aria, \u201cScherza infida,\u201d Ariodante, a Scottish knight, imagines his beloved, the princess Ginevra, frolicking with his rival, a duke. The slow, halting melody conveys both his longing and his desolation; a curiously lilting bass line for pizzicato strings seems to mock Ariodante with a hint of Ginevra\u2019s fickleness. In a somber middle section, the knight resolves to take his own life and return as a ghost to torment Ginevra. The music has such grief-stricken elegance that for a moment it almost convinces you that this is possible. The English Concert\u2019s almost annual visits to Carnegie since 2013 for concert performances of Handel operas and oratorios have been highlights of several seasons. Ms. DiDonato starred in the ensemble\u2019s extraordinary \u201cAlcina\u201d (2014), and the hall was packed for \u201cAriodante,\u201d one of Handel\u2019s longest operas: The performance lasted close to four hours, with two intermissions. (It was webcast live on medici.tv and is now available for viewing there.) On the surface, his operas, following a parade-of-arias structure, may seem stuck in conventions that were becoming dated even in Handel\u2019s day. But at his best, he dug in to tease out every psychological current in his characters. And \u201cAriodante,\u201d from 1735, is a masterpiece, especially as performed on Sunday by an exceptional cast. In just the first few arias, Handel shows us, one by one, who these characters are. \u201cAriodante\u201d opens as Ginevra (the bright-voiced soprano Christiane Karg) tells her attendant about her love for Ariodante in an effusive arioso. Yet fluttery touches in the music suggest that the princess lacks some grounding. When Polinesso, the preening duke, arrives and declares his love, Ginevra rebuffs him in a feisty aria full of spitfire runs. Her gullible attendant, Dalinda (Mary Bevan, a luscious lyric soprano), has fallen for the duke, as she reveals in a demure aria suggesting her vulnerability. Polinesso (like Ariodante, a trouser role, here nailed by the hearty contralto Sonia Prina), sensing opportunity, feigns love for Dalinda in an audaciously manipulative aria. The solid bass-baritone Matthew Brook, as the king; the spirited tenor Tyson Miller, as Odoardo, the king\u2019s aide; and the sweet-voiced tenor David Portillo, as Ariodante\u2019s devoted brother, were all excellent. Mr. Bicket\u2019s superb players brought clarity and suppleness to their stylish and refined playing. We can look forward to the English Concert\u2019s next Handel installment, when it returns in spring 2018 with \u201cRinaldo.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/arts/music/review-joyce-didonato-the-english-concert-handel-ariodante-carnegie-hall.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T17:42:22-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-05-01T17:42:22-04:00", "abstract": "Ms. DiDonato, the great mezzo-soprano, headed a stellar cast in the English Concert\u2019s performance on Sunday at Carnegie Hall.", "title": "Review: Joyce DiDonato Is Wrenching in Handel\u2019s \u2018Ariodante\u2019"}
