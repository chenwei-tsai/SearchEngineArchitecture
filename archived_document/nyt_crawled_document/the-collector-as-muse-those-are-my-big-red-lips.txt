{"section": "Arts", "text": "The French screenwriter and director Dani\u00e8le Thompson says one of her fondest memories is from the shoot for her 2007 film, \u201cAvenue Montaigne,\u201d in which an art collector, played by Claude Brasseur, is forced to sell a clutch of masterpieces. Ms. Thompson set about lovingly creating her dream collection on the set: \u201cThere\u2019s a huge Braque, a Mondrian, an enormous number of paintings I could never own,\u201d she says. (She was so smitten with a resin copy of Constantin Brancusi\u2019s \u201cThe Kiss\u201d that it now resides in her garden.) But there is no shortage of pedigreed art in the Paris apartment that Ms. Thompson, 75, who wrote and directed the just-released \u201cC\u00e9zanne et Moi\u201d \u2014 about the fraught friendship between that Post-Impressionist master and \u00c9mile Zola \u2014 shares with Albert Koski, her husband and the film\u2019s producer. In addition to works by Georges Braque and Raoul Dufy inherited from her father, the film director G\u00e9rard Oury, and her grandmother, an \u201cartist groupie\u201d who hobnobbed with the giants of the early-20th-century Paris art scene, Ms. Thompson\u2019s collection includes canvases by David Salle, Tom Wesselmann, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Robert Combas and the art photographer-provocateur Marylin Minter. Ms. Thompson\u2019s abiding love of French artists is apparent in her new film\u2019s sweeping closing montage of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s paintings of Mont Sainte-Victoire in Aix-en-Provence, and her collecting betrays a suitably Franco-existential mind-set. \u201cYou don\u2019t know why you choose these things,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really something that\u2019s an instinct, more than a decision.\u201d Your family was involved with some of France\u2019s most storied artists. My grandmother knew everybody in the art world in Paris: Chagall, Braque, Dufy, whom she actually had a long affair with. She took me everywhere with her \u2014 she\u2019d call me and say, \u201cYou won\u2019t go to school today, I\u2019m taking you to see Braque.\u201d So we\u2019d go to the studio, and I\u2019d sit in a little corner. She was good at teaching me that this was a very, very privileged moment, that I was actually looking at a genius. How did you come to own one of Braque\u2019s palettes, signed by the artist? That was my grandmother\u2019s. She\u2019d go see these artists and say to them [coyly], \u201cOh, this is so beautiful, can I take it?\u201d Then before leaving the studio, she\u2019d say, \u201cCan you sign this for me?\u201d I have three or four of [the Cubist painter] Jacques Villon\u2019s palettes, Marcel Duchamp\u2019s brother. One of my greatest regrets was that when I first came to America, I was 18 years old \u2014 Jacques gave me a little piece of paper with his brother\u2019s number and told me to call him. And I never did. I\u2019ll never get over that. You have several paintings by Tom Wesselmann with you as the subject. My first husband and I moved from Paris to New York in the 1960s. One night we went to an opening at Sidney Janis, and it was Tom Wesselmann. He said, \u201cI would love to do your portrait, would you pose nude?\u201d I said yes. You ended up in some of Wesselmann\u2019s most famous paintings, including the \u201cMouth\u201d series from 1965, which may have inspired the Rolling Stones\u2019 lips-and-tongue logo. He used me, if I may say this, in the nicest sense of the word. Pieces of me are scattered over a lot of his paintings. My red nails \u2014 I always wear red nails, I still do \u2014 my hands, my breasts. That series, the big red lips \u2014 well, those are my big red lips. There are two Dufys in your apartment, a painting and a nude drawing. My father had many, many Dufys, which, unfortunately, we had to sell when he died. The painting is from a series Dufy did on the 14th of July [Bastille Day], very small but so joyful and blue and white and red. The nude is a beautiful drawing \u2014 you recognize Dufy, and yet it\u2019s very classical. And, probably, I didn\u2019t want to be the only nude woman in the apartment. You and your husband also collect artists from the New York downtown scene of the \u201980s. We were in New York, having dinner with Eric Fischl and David Salle, and there were all these artists we had never heard of. We bought a painting by one of them for very little money. And it turned out to be a Basquiat. For years, we had friends who would come over and say, \u201cHow can you live with that?\u201d Now everybody says, \u201cOh, my God, is this a Basquiat?\u201d", "item_type": "Article", "abstract": "In an array of art spanning Raul Dufy to David Salle, Dani\u00e8le Thompson, director of the recent film \u201cC\u00e9zanne et Moi,\u201d is sometimes the subject herself.", "created_date": "2017-04-20T15:05:45-04:00", "title": "The Collector as Muse: \u2018Those Are My Big Red Lips\u2019", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-19T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/arts/design/the-collector-as-muse-those-are-my-big-red-lips.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T15:05:45-04:00"}
