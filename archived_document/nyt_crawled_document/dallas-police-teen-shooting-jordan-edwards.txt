{"text": "BALCH SPRINGS, Tex. \u2014 Investigators in Texas were examining footage on Tuesday from police body cameras as they tried to piece together the events that led to the fatal shooting by an officer of a 15-year-old high school student in a car over the weekend, a spokeswoman said. The student, Jordan Edwards, was in a car leaving the area of a house party about 11 p.m. on Saturday in his hometown, Balch Springs, east of the Dallas area. He died from a rifle wound to the head after one of the officers responding to reports of underage drinking at the party opened fire, the coroner\u2019s office and the police have said. A statement released on Tuesday by a lawyer for the family, S. Lee Merritt, said Jordan\u2019s brothers \u201cwitnessed firsthand his violent, senseless murder.\u201d The statement also asked people to refrain from protests, violence and marches in Jordan\u2019s or his family\u2019s name, and described his death as a \u201ctremendous loss.\u201d The Balch Springs Police Department initially said one of its officers had opened fire on the vehicle after it reversed in an \u201caggressive manner,\u201d but on Monday, Jonathan Haber, the police chief, said new evidence showed that the killing did not unfold the way authorities originally claimed. The department then changed its explanation of how events unfolded, saying in an updated statement later on Monday that the officers had been investigating a house party when they heard gunshots. When they went outside the house to investigate, they \u201cconfronted\u201d a vehicle backing down the street that continued to reverse despite multiple commands to stop, the statement said. \u201cThe vehicle then pulled forward as the officer continued to approach the vehicle giving verbal commands. The vehicle continued the main roadway driving away from the officer as an officer shot into the vehicle striking the passenger,\u201d the statement said. On Tuesday, as the community in Balch Springs mourned, Melinda Urbina, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Department, said in an email that the investigation would take time. Asked whether it was examining whether the officer had violated department guidelines for the use of force by opening fire with a rifle into a car that was driving away, she said: \u201cThere are a number of factors being considered in this case.\u201d \u201cWe are still reviewing the body camera footage in addition to all of the other evidence collected. Our detectives are still gathering evidence as well,\u201d she added. Other questions have not been publicly answered, such as how many shots were fired, whether more than one officer opened fire and what type of gun was used. \u201cThere is a large volume of evidence to review, and it will take time to construct the narrative of what occurred,\u201d Ms. Urbina said. She said it was still too early to tell if body camera footage would be released. That decision would be made with the Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office, which was also investigating, she said. At Mesquite High School, where Jordan was a freshman, students returned uneasily to their routines on Tuesday. They sat for state standardized tests, and football players were set to attend practice, both of which had been canceled on Monday because of Jordan\u2019s death. Jordan\u2019s teammates turned his locker into a memorial, leaving letters and poems. Jeff Fleener, the head football coach, said that he and the team would focus on remembering Jordan but that they were continuing to track news about the circumstances of his death. \u201cHe was a phenomenal young man,\u201d Mr. Fleener said. \u201cHe was an example of what we would like all our athletes to be. Great in the classroom, never got into trouble, was at school every single day and had a great attitude.\u201d Mr. Fleener, who has been in his job for only two months, said Jordan had welcomed him warmly to the team and was known as a good friend. \u201cFirst thing he\u2019d do was flash that big smile at you, and he was going to change your entire mood and attitude.\u201d He said Jordan and his older brother, who is also on the football team, came from a close and loving family, with supportive parents and aunts and uncles who looked out for them. Jordan began playing football on peewee teams around the age of 6, and he had hoped to play in college \u2014 and had the grades to make it happen, Mr. Fleener said. \u201cWe continue to read up on everything that happened and just realize how sad and tragic the situation is,\u201d Mr. Fleener said. \u201cThere is a lot of anger, but it\u2019s a great teaching point for us to talk to them about the right way\u201d to deal with it. \u201cThe person who yells the loudest isn\u2019t always the one who\u2019s heard.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/us/dallas-police-teen-shooting-jordan-edwards.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T14:27:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T14:27:24-04:00", "abstract": "The teenager, Jordan Edwards, was a passenger in a car fired upon by a police officer responding to reports of underage drinking at a party, the authorities said.", "title": "What Did Police Body Cameras See in Killing of 15-Year-Old Texan?"}
