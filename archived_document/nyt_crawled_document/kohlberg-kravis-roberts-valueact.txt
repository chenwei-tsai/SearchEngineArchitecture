{"text": "Some three decades after Henry Kravis was called a barbarian, he has encountered one at his own gate. Jeffrey W. Ubben, whose ValueAct Capital just disclosed an interest in Mr. Kravis\u2019s buyout shop, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is usually friendlier in his approach with the companies in which he invests than the term might suggest. Even so, there is a chance things could get testy. Mason Morfit, president of Mr. Ubben\u2019s $16 billion activist investing firm, said on Thursday that he saw plenty of upside for K.K.R., whose funds own stakes in companies including First Data, GoDaddy, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Lyft. He reckons the firm\u2019s traded units are undervalued by half. Mr. Ubben is also considered politer than many of his aggressive ilk. With an interest of less than 5 percent, he is not required to say if he plans to make suggestions about how K.K.R. should run its business differently or if it is just a passive holding. And the firm\u2019s partnership structure insulates Mr. Kravis and his colleagues from being pushed around anyway. Bullish perspectives like Mr. Morfit\u2019s have fallen on deaf ears for a long time, though. Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group, suggested last week that if his firm\u2019s units were valued the same way as a typical Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index company\u2019s shares based on dividend yield, they would be trading at $100 each instead of $30. One reason Blackstone, K.K.R. and others aren\u2019t analyzed the way most other big public companies are, however, is that their complex structures are designed to help minimize taxes and keep founders and employees in control. Turning these partnerships into more typical corporations \u2014 something discussed off and on for years and possibly of interest to Mr. Ubben, according to a Bloomberg report \u2014 would probably invite new investors and higher valuations. A sharply reduced business tax rate, as proposed by President Trump, could revive the idea. A company\u2019s income would be taxed at a far lower rate than the personal rate many investors pay now on the profit passed through by K.K.R. and others. The Citigroup analyst William Katz estimated last year that while K.K.R.\u2019s earnings would fall by nearly a fifth at a 22.5 percent tax rate, the firm should also trade at a notably higher valuation. That is no certainty, however. And once a publicly traded partnership converts, it cannot easily go back. Any discussions between Mr. Ubben and Mr. Kravis may remain cordial only for so long.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/dealbook/kohlberg-kravis-roberts-valueact.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T15:10:48-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T15:10:48-04:00", "abstract": "The activist investor ValueAct Capital has taken a stake in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
