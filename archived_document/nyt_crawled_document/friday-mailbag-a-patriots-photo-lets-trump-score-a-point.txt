The New York Times\u2019s Sports section covered the visit, viewed through the political angle that several players skipped the event: Only 34 players attended compared with the nearly 50 the last time the Patriots won the Super Bowl, in 2015, when Barack Obama was president, according to a team representative. Promoting the story on its Twitter feed, the Sports section spliced photos of the two events together, both taken on the south side of the White House, to indicate the comparative difference in attendance. (The photos were also included in the story.) The problem, however, was that the photo taken Wednesday included only players and coaches, whereas the photo taken during President Obama\u2019s tenure included over 40 additional support staff \u2014 who, this time around, were seated on the South Lawn \u2014 which greatly exaggerated the difference. After the Patriots pointed this out through the team\u2019s Twitter handle, the Times Sports section promptly sent another tweet to correct the earlier one, then removed the photo from its story and appended a correction. By Thursday morning President Trump had gotten wind of the error. Several readers were upset that The Times provided ammunition for right-wing critics. One reader put the issue succinctly: We asked Jason Stallman, the Sports editor, for an explanation. The public editor\u2019s take: Bravo to the Sports editor for his honest response. Regrettably, as the readers say, it gives ammunition to those who doubt The Times\u2019s impartiality in matters of politics. Last Friday, The Times ran a story on the dismissals of two Georgia police officers two days after they assaulted a man, punching him in the face and kicking him in the head, during a traffic stop. The top of the story featured the professional photographs of the police officers. The booking photo of the victim, Demetrius Bryan Hollins, was included near the end. Several readers wrote in to protest the photo choices for the article. We brought the concern to Beth Flynn, the deputy photo editor, for a response. The public editor\u2019s take: Another thanks to an editor with candor and clarity, in this case about how the photo selection process works. One reader wrote in this week to ask why The Times, in a story on a Michigan doctor who is accused of performing female genital mutilation on two 7-year-old girls referred to the practice as \u201cgenital cutting.\u201d We asked Celia Dugger, the editor of Health and Science, to explain the reasoning behind the decision. During the presidential campaign, conservative readers intermittently wrote in to complain that The Times referred to Melania Trump as \u201cMs.\u201d rather than \u201cMrs.\u201d The public editor addressed the question then \u2014 the first lady took the default courtesy title \u201cMs.\u201d because she hadn\u2019t expressed a preference \u2014 and in January we noted that the first lady had since expressed that she would prefer to be called Mrs. Trump. This week a reader wrote in to ask The Times to drop the courtesy title \u201cMrs.\u201d for women altogether. We asked Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, to address the question. The public editor\u2019s take: I\u2019m on the record as an advocate for discarding courtesy titles altogether. As The Times tries to reach a younger audience, referring to Mrs. or Ms. or Mr. seems stuck in the past. But if we can do it only one at a time, let\u2019s start with Mrs. Finally, several readers wondered if an article recommending \u201cmoody film noir classics\u201d on Amazon Prime was actually a paid placement by Amazon. We went to Gilbert Cruz, the editor of Watching, for a reply. As for our recommendation for what to watch on Amazon Prime, though it\u2019s not a moody film noir classic, we highly endorse \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Well, one of us does, at least, if you can guess who.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T05:00:30-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/public-editor/friday-mailbag-a-patriots-photo-lets-trump-score-a-point.html", "item_type": "Article"}
