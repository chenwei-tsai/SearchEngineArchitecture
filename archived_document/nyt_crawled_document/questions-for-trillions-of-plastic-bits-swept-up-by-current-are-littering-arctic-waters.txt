To what extent could you remove all the plastic you use by purchasing or finding other materials, or by going without? Describe how easy or difficult aspects of this might be. Questions for Comprehension and Analysis 1. What does the Science Advances study show? Where are the trillions of pieces of plastic headed? Where did they originate, and where will they end up? 2. How is climate change leading to an increase in plastic pollution in the Arctic? What does Andr\u00e9s C\u00f3zar Caba\u00f1as think about the results? What is he worried about? 3. How many millions of tons of plastic get into the ocean each year, and how much is estimated to be already there? 4. Describe how ocean currents work to move plastic garbage around. What are scientists doing to collect data on plastic debris? What did they discover? 5. Why does Dr. Caba\u00f1as say that the issue of plastic pollution \u201cwill require international agreements?\u201d What Do You Think? Make a prediction about what you think our world will be like in the future if the current rate of plastic pollution continues to rise. Brainstorm ways to alleviate the problem, or to eliminate it.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T04:30:02-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/learning/questions-for-trillions-of-plastic-bits-swept-up-by-current-are-littering-arctic-waters.html", "item_type": "Article"}
