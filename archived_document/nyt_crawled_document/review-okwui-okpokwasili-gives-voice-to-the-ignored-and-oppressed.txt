It can be oblique, but it\u2019s also alive as it drifts through myriad subjects to conjure a surreal, imaginary place where, you get the distinct feeling, women have long been oppressed and ignored, or worse: treated like victims. At least in Ms. Okpokwasili\u2019s deconstructed, trippy world, they have a voice: \u201cThere was a time \u2014 way, way back \u2014 when Oprah was a human being, just a woman, she felt pain and she suffered.\u201d Those words, spoken by Thuli Dumakude, the veteran South African singer and actress, are an introduction to Ms. Okpokwasili\u2019s dark wit. Created with the visual designer and director Peter Born, \u201cPoor People\u2019s TV Room\u201d is blanketed in such gleaming darkness that the stage takes on a painterly quality. Sometimes the distancing works, but in other moments the theatricality feels forced, as if the creators were faithfully adhering to the rules of a deconstructionist playbook. The piece was partly inspired by women\u2019s resistance movements in Nigeria, though that isn\u2019t necessarily discernible in the final product, which blends dance, music and theater. What is obvious is how Ms. Okpokwasili\u2019s virtuosity \u2014 she can\u2019t tame her magnificence \u2014 overshadows the other performers. She\u2019s a force. The stage is animated before we enter New York Live Arts, where the work continues through Saturday. Under shadowy lighting, a sheet of plastic cuts across the performance space and ripples as dancers, whose bodies are dimly silhouetted, vibrate in the near-dark. This quiet swirl of activity makes sense: In \u201cPoor People\u2019s TV Room,\u201d the body and the mind are in communion, creating a trickle of motion that, from one action to the next, feels like a slowly cascading avalanche. The collaborators play with shifting perspectives: Ms. Okpokwasili and Katrina Reid stretch out on a table \u2014 it looks like a bed \u2014 and are filmed from above. A live feed is then projected onto a screen, which renders them vertical. One appears to sit; the other stands by a window. Separating what is real and what is imaginary creates some confusion in this work. \u201cPoor People\u2019s TV Room\u201d is most rooted in its pure-movement sections, as when Ms. Dumakude and Nehemoyia Young, often paired, shuffle forward in parallel steps that hiccup in time. In a hypnotic section, Ms. Okpokwasili creates an intricate choreographic web with braiding arms and forceful palms. Engulfed by her gestural movement, she drops to the floor and rises again and again as if possessed by spirits. One thing is certain: \u201cPoor People\u2019s TV Room\u201d is full of them.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/arts/dance/review-okwui-okpokwasili-gives-voice-to-the-ignored-and-oppressed.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:20:49-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "title": "Review: Okwui Okpokwasili Gives Voice to the Ignored and Oppressed", "item_type": "Article"}
