{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Tuesday that the United States needed \u201ca good \u2018shutdown\u2019 \u201d this fall to force a partisan confrontation over federal spending, and suggested that he might move to reverse longstanding Senate rules that effectively require a supermajority to approve most major legislation. The declarations, in a pair of posts on Twitter, appeared to defend a spending package that Congress is likely to clear this week, but that fails to accomplish many of Mr. Trump\u2019s stated goals, including any money to build a wall on the southern border that was his most talked-about campaign promise. The Twitter messages were also an indication of the degree to which bipartisan negotiations in Congress on that bill and others, including a health care overhaul, have bedeviled Mr. Trump at this early stage of his presidency, forcing him to bow to political realities to which he had insisted he was immune. \u201cThe reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there!\u201d Mr. Trump said in one post, an apparent reference to the spending package. The solution, he said, was either to elect more Republican senators in 2018, the next midterm elections, \u201cor change the rules now to 51%.\u201d That appeared to refer to scrapping the so-called filibuster that allows any senator to insist on a two-thirds vote, rather than a simple majority, to act on legislative matters. Republicans already moved last month to eliminate the use of the tactic for Supreme Court confirmations, allowing them to move forward with the approval of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch with only a simple majority. \u201cOur country needs a good \u2018shutdown' in September to fix mess!\u201d Mr. Trump said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/us/politics/good-shutdown-congress-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T09:55:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T09:55:37-04:00", "abstract": "In a pair of posts on Twitter, the president appeared to defend a spending package that Congress that fails to accomplish many of his stated goals.", "title": "Trump Says U.S. Needs Government \u2018Shutdown\u2019"}
