{"abstract": "This super-slow work unfolds across the Marron Atrium and down two staircases as curious museumgoers look on.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "It takes about 15 seconds, walking at a relaxed pace, to descend the stairs leading from the atrium of the Museum of Modern Art to the ground-floor lobby. On Sunday afternoon, the dancer Oisin Monaghan spent over an hour on that route, sliding down the steps through a glacial series of reclining, prone and seated poses. Visitors came and went, with some pausing to study his often-motionless body \u2014 was he sleeping? injured? \u2014 and others passing by unfazed. When he reached the bottom, he stood up and walked away. The next day, he would do it again. That drawn-out descent was part of Maria Hassabi\u2019s hypnotizing \u201cPlastic,\u201d a live installation of super-slow movement devised as a repeating loop. Through March 20, it will be unfolding whenever the museum is open, its tremendously focused dancers (17 in all) progressing incrementally across the floors and furniture of the Marron Atrium, down the lobby staircase and down the stairs connecting the fourth- and fifth-floor galleries. (On Fridays, it takes place only in the atrium.) The Modern has presented its share of buzz-worthy dance programs in recent years. But not one has felt as well suited to the space, nor as satisfying to spend time with, as \u201cPlastic.\u201d Maybe dance in the museum has been too much in denial of the architectural reality: A museum is not a theater. \u201cPlastic\u201d doesn\u2019t pretend it is. You can comfortably watch the work from many vantage points, for any length of time. At first it may seem like no more than Instagram fodder. But when you slow to its pace for longer than the time it takes to snap a photo and relax to watch dancers like Hristoula Harakas and David Thomson, poignant details crystallize: the trembling of her arm, supporting her weight as she sinks into a split; the inward yet receptive quality of his gaze; how a desperate pose can, with the slightest shift, become a hopeful one. Gusts of ambient sound designed by Morten Norbye Halvorsen periodically blow through the space. The performers\u2019 denim uniforms, including pants with jeweled inseams (styled by threeASFOUR), match the gray of the atrium floor. Some museum-specific problems remain unresolved. How to ensure the performers\u2019 safety without killing the mood? On Sunday, security guards directed traffic on the lobby stairs: \u201cStay to the left. Performing artist ahead!\u201d It was a jarring but maybe necessary reminder that these exquisite dancers are human, capable of being hurt.", "section": "Arts", "title": "Review: Maria Hassabi\u2019s \u2018Plastic\u2019 Sends Dancers Crawling Through MoMA", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/arts/dance/review-maria-hassabis-plastic-sends-dancers-crawling-through-moma.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-22T07:00:09-04:00", "published_date": "2016-02-22T19:00:00-05:00", "created_date": "2017-04-22T07:00:09-04:00", "material_type_facet": "Review", "item_type": "Article"}
