{"text": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The most popular group in the second round of the N.F.L. draft was nearly 3,000 miles away from Philadelphia: the Washington Huskies secondary. Three members \u2014 cornerbacks Kevin King and Sidney Jones, and safety Budda Baker \u2014 were taken in the first 11 picks Friday night. But none of those choices drew the attention that Cincinnati\u2019s pick at No. 48 over all did: Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon, who was not invited to the scouting combine because in 2014 he had been filmed punching a woman, breaking bones in her face. Mixon was suspended from the team for a year after the altercation but came back and had two strong seasons. In 2016, he was an All-Big 12 performer who set the team record for all-purpose yardage in a season. Fans in the draft theater booed aggressively when the former Bengals tackle Anthony Munoz, a Hall of Famer, announced the choice of Mixon. Cincinnati has a history of adding players with off-field problems to the roster. Bengals Coach Marvin Lewis admitted that some fans might \u201cpause for a second\u201d because of the selection. \u201cBut this thing\u2019s got to move forward,\u201d Lewis said, \u201cand he\u2019s got to move on. He\u2019s lived with this since the day it\u2019s occurred.\u201d Earlier, King\u2019s extra-long stay at the draft \u2014 he was one of five players attending who were not taken in the opening round \u2014 ended swiftly. King, a 6-foot-3 former safety, was taken by Green Bay as the first selection in the second round. He is not particularly speedy but has the size and the aggressiveness that pro teams seek.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/football/joe-mixon-cincinnati-bengals-nfl-draft.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T23:46:30-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T23:46:30-04:00", "abstract": "Mixon, an All-Big 12 running back in 2016, had been suspended by the University of Oklahoma for one season after the altercation.", "title": "Bengals Draft Joe Mixon, Who Was Suspended for Punching a Woman"}
