{"text": "Michael Moore has brought his zeal, his humor and his outrage to film, television and books. And now he\u2019s bringing them to Broadway. This left-wing provocateur is not shy about his agenda, made explicit on a preliminary poster for the production, which poses the question, in all capital letters, \u201cCan a Broadway show bring down a sitting president?\u201d His plan, he said, is to perform a scripted (but also responsive to the news) one-man (more-or-less) show, called \u201cThe Terms of My Surrender,\u201d eight times a week for 12 weeks, starting in July. He said that the show would simultaneously be entertaining and infuriating \u2014 not stand-up comedy, not a TED Talk, not a rally \u2014 but \u201ca very developed piece of entertainment for people who like to think.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a humorous play about a country that\u2019s just elected a madman \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s really no other way to put it,\u201d he said in an interview at Sardi\u2019s, the theater district mainstay. He was characteristically shlumpy, in an oversized black pullover hoodie and a red 49ers baseball cap; gracious to the passers-by who thanked him for his activism and asked for a handshake or a selfie; and thoughtful about theater, as he explained what a firebrand was doing amid the \u201cCats\u201d crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re 10 blocks from Trump Tower, we\u2019re in the corporate capital of America, we\u2019re in the financial capital of America, we\u2019re in the media capital of America,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cIf one was going to stand on a stage and do the things that I\u2019m going to do, there\u2019s only one place to do it, and it\u2019s here in this city and it\u2019s right here at the epicenter of creative expression and free speech.\u201d He said that he had been thinking about trying his hand at theater for some time, but the election last year of Donald J. Trump as president \u2014 which Mr. Moore correctly predicted \u2014 provided an impetus to do it now. \u201cCan something like this unravel an unhinged man?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think that discombobulation might be our most effective path to undoing his presidency.\u201d However, he said it was not solely about the current president. \u201cTo say it\u2019s just about Trump would simplify it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people will find themselves laughing one minute and wanting to go look for some pitchforks and torches the next.\u201d Although Mr. Moore is a Broadway novice, \u201cThe Terms of My Surrender\u201d has immediately attracted industry attention. The Shubert Organization has agreed to present it in the 1,018-seat Belasco Theater. Michael Mayer, a Tony winner for \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d is the director, and David Rockwell, a Tony winner for \u201cShe Loves Me,\u201d will design the set. The show\u2019s lead producers are IMG Original Content, making its first stage venture, and Carole Shorenstein Hays, a frequent Broadway producer. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would call it a play; but it is a theater piece,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Mayer said. \u201cThere is going to be a certain amount of rabble-rousing. There\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll have some surprise guests throughout the run, and some surprise postshow excursions that will vary night to night.\u201d Mr. Moore, 63, became famous as a documentary filmmaker, bursting into public consciousness with the groundbreaking \u201cRoger and Me,\u201d in 1989, about his hometown, Flint, Mich., and winning an Oscar in 2003 for \u201cBowling for Columbine.\u201d His theatrical experience is limited \u2014 he starred in two plays in high school, and tested out some of his new material in London. But he has an unexpected fondness for theater. As a child, he spent summers with relatives on Staten Island, and saw an occasional Broadway show, starting with \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d He has seen a lot of one-man and one-woman shows. He was even once mugged in Times Square. And he clearly believes in the power of theater to effect change. \u201cIt was either this or the Ice Capades,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made my movies. I\u2019ve had two prime-time TV series. I\u2019ve had eight books on your best-seller lists. I\u2019ve done a lot of things with the internet. But I haven\u2019t done this.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/theater/michael-moore-broadway-the-terms-of-my-surrender-donald-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Theater", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T11:15:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T11:15:16-04:00", "abstract": "A (mostly) one-man show, \u201cThe Terms of My Surrender,\u201d will run eight times a week for 12 weeks, starting in July, at the Belasco Theater.", "title": "Michael Moore to Take Aim at Trump, on Broadway"}
