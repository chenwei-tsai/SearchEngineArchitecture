{"text": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mike was away this week, so another Mike, the DealBook reporter Michael J. de la Merced, filled in. Farhad: Hello, Michael! Thanks so much for filling in for Mike. I got a panicked email from him this morning saying he suddenly didn\u2019t have time to chat about tech news. When I asked him why, he offered this cryptic explanation: \u201cI loved my previous life. I had so many things going. This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.\u201d Michael: Happy to be here! At the least, it\u2019s much better than having spent thousands of dollars on a luxury concert festival in the Bahamas \u2014 only for there to be no musical acts, tents, food or luxury of any kind. Farhad: O.K., well, it\u2019s that time of the year again: earnings season. Several tech giants reported their quarterly numbers this week. It wasn\u2019t very exciting. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are all making bundles off their cloud businesses. Twitter\u2019s ad revenue is falling but, in a surprise, it added nine million more monthly active users \u2014 it now has 328 million. That\u2019s less than half the number at Instagram, which didn\u2019t report earnings (it\u2019s owned by Facebook, which reports next week) but did say it had crossed the 700 million-user mark. That resonated with me, as I\u2019ve been spending a lot more time on Instagram lately \u2014 at the expense of Twitter. Michael: It still strikes me as remarkable, and a little sad, that Twitter can be at the center of political discourse these days and still can\u2019t somehow figure out a way to increase its business. Maybe it\u2019s still too early for any Trump-related activity to filter into those financial results, but that glimmer of hope investors see feels fairly dim. I\u2019m curious to see whether Snapchat can continue to figure out how to stave off Facebook in ways that seem to have eluded Twitter. Farhad: Also, as expected, Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, outlined a plan to loosen the network neutrality rules adopted by the agency two years ago. Now advocates of net neutrality say that the \u201copen internet\u201d is under threat \u2014 that is, internet providers will be free to block or prioritize certain content over others. It\u2019s pretty alarming, but I suspect it will go through without much of a hitch, as it\u2019s a fairly complicated issue that is unlikely to arouse much mobilized opposition. Michael: This is a shameful thing to admit, but every time I see \u201cnet neutrality\u201d in a news story, I have to force myself to continue reading the article. There are very real potential implications to the F.C.C.\u2019s actions, but you\u2019re right that it\u2019ll take time to see whether they pan out. (That said, most of what I use the internet for these days is watching \u201cThe Great British Baking Show: Masterclass\u201d on Netflix, and if my ability to watch Paul and Mary bake a perfect Victorian tennis cake is threatened, I will be very cross.) Farhad: Let\u2019s dive back into the mess that is Uber. So, you may know that Waymo, Google\u2019s self-driving car sister company, is suing Uber for theft of its technology. There was a development related to that legal case this week. Anthony Levandowski, the former Google employee and current Uber employee who is at the center of the case, stepped aside from his job of leading some of the company\u2019s self-driving car technology. This follows a split between Levandowski\u2019s lawyers and Uber\u2019s lawyers: Levandowski, seeking to protect himself, had invoked his Fifth Amendment rights in the case, which potentially imperiled Uber\u2019s case. His stepping aside from the self-driving job will give some legal cover to Uber, it seems. Michael: Levandowski\u2019s legal issues continue to be one of the biggest millstones hanging around Uber\u2019s neck, especially if the company believes that self-driving cars are critical to its future. Another one is the man who\u2019s leading Uber, Travis Kalanick, as Lesser Mike deftly chronicled in his profile of the C.E.O. earlier this week. For a company that once looked unassailable, Uber is under fire from all sides, and definitely doesn\u2019t look as if it can go public anytime soon. But why haven\u2019t other competitors \u2014 Lyft first and foremost, but also smaller ones like Gett \u2014 been able to seize upon those issues and provide more heat? Farhad: Yeah, I dunno. Meantime, two more self-driving car items: Bloomberg published a photo of a retrofitted Lexus that Apple is using to test its self-driving tech. And Waymo announced a program to let people in Phoenix test its fleet of self-driving minivans. Also: A start-up funded by tech titans \u2014 including Alphabet\u2019s chief, Larry Page \u2014 announced a flying vehicle that was described as a \u201cflying car,\u201d but actually was more like a boat that can hover. It doesn\u2019t drive on roads, which seems to be a requirement to be a flying car. Anyway, the boat car did remind me of The Simpsons\u2019 Knightboat: So, do you want a flying car? Michael: Well, I really always wanted a \u201cBack to the Future\u201d DeLorean. But sure, a flying car wouldn\u2019t be so bad, if it meant dodging all the traffic on the 101 and 280 highways. Farhad: Meh. I prefer Elon Musk\u2019s idea \u2014 tunnels! Anyway, thank you for being here, Better Mike.
