{"text": "Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. We try to stay buoyant here at Cooking. Food is our one true thing, the kitchen our refuge. (That\u2019s me in the corner with the metal colander on my head, waiting for things to get better while the pasta finishes boiling.) Oh, hello, Monday. This week, consider taking a moment to check in on your mental health, or at least check in with people who make it their business to mix food and self-care. Our British sisters at Do What You Want have put out a zine on mental health, and you can believe there is lots of food-related stuff in there. You can also always dip into Kat Kinsman\u2019s world. She has written a book called \u201cHi, Anxiety\u201d and runs a collective healing hive called Chefs With Issues. She also writes about breakfast in ways you would never imagine at the Tasting Table. So yes, about breakfast. You can find some healthy ideas here or just make breakfast carbonara, a recipe I pried from the hands of Alton Brown. Here in the South, where I spend much of my time, shrimp and grits are a reliable breakfast and a great supper, too. We eat a lot of Gulf shrimp down here, and I encourage you to make a point of trying to find it instead of questionable imported crustaceans. They probably have a reliable frozen version if you don\u2019t live in the South, where the grocery stores always have some fresh to pick up. Either way, get some in the shell and roast them in a big dish of rock salt. It\u2019s spectacular to serve and ridiculously easy. Scampi is another option, especially if you don\u2019t want to deal with the shells. Melissa Clark has a great recipe, ready in 15 minutes. And while we\u2019re speaking of fish, take time to read this article on overfishing by one of the smartest reporters on The New York Times International desk? Pair that with a piece on Paul Greenberg\u2019s quest to spend a year eating fish for every meal, which he turned into a \u201cFrontline\u201d documentary. You\u2019ll learn a lot about which fish you should eat, and why you should eat more of it. Mr. Greenberg\u2019s a big fan of frozen wild salmon. So am I (and I speak as former Alaskan). Here\u2019s David Tanis with a wild salmon with green sauce, or cruise through FloFab\u2019s salmon cooking guide. And if salmon isn\u2019t your thing, there are plenty of other sustainable fish out there. Use them in our guide to fish recipes that aren\u2019t salmon. And let us not ignore clams, either. We\u2019ve got tons of other recipes to look through on Cooking, too. You\u2019ll find plenty of feel-good options, like bucatini all\u2019Amatriciana. And do leave comments on recipes you\u2019ve tested. That dialogue among our community of cooks makes for some good reading. Oh, and one last bit of news. I\u2019m turning the newsletter over to Melissa Clark until Sam gets back from digging out news and recipes in Australia. Melissa is a trusted captain, so head into the rest of the week assured a steady hand is on the tiller. And, of course, help can always be found at cookingcare@nytimes.com. It\u2019s been a swell run here, pals. I\u2019ll probably be back this summer, covering for Sam Sifton during his annual unplugged retreat. Until then, let\u2019s always remember the good times.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/dining/brain-food.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Food", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T11:10:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T11:10:05-04:00", "abstract": "Breakfast, shrimp, fish: We\u2019ve got recipes to feed body, mind and soul.", "title": "Brain Food"}
