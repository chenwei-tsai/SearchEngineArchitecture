{"text": "Alice Anane\u2019s father died suddenly of a brutal brain-wasting disease when he was 49. She was 15 at the time and remembers her family thinking that he had contracted mad cow disease on a trip to Britain. Twenty years later, when she was pregnant with her third child, a routine amniocentesis revealed something different: Her father had most likely died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare illness known as C.J.D. that erases the brain as it ends life, typically within three months. Unfortunately, she was a carrier. Worse, the disease could manifest at any time after age 30. Ms. Anane, a hospital administrator at the time, was then 35 and had 8-year-old twins. And if the disease did surface, there would be nothing that could be done to slow its progression. \u201cI couldn\u2019t adjust to this information,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou understand the implication for the whole family? We are nine siblings. Your whole, big family is at risk now.\u201d She started researching the disease, as many people would. But she had an advantage to accelerate her efforts: She and her siblings are part of a family office, a private organization that manages the assets of a single extended family. Ms. Anane\u2019s mother gave the go-ahead for the office to donate to the scientists and clinical trials her daughter had identified. And the office backed Ms. Anane as she traveled to conferences and met carriers of the disease and their families. Family offices typically serve as investment vehicles, financial managers and charitable advisers. Sometimes, they protect profligate offspring from their worst habits; other times, they are the locus of squabbling among heirs. Financial decisions are guided by a mix of paid staff members and relatives. Yet when family offices get it right in the field of medical research, they can have a big impact. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the money \u2014 it\u2019s the celebrity that they can leverage to get other people to commit money,\u201d said Bill Woodson, who runs the family office group in North America for Citibank\u2019s private bank. \u201cIt takes real discipline, outreach and a willingness to be public.\u201d It also takes someone in the family to make sure all members are on board with what the office is doing. David Dolby, son of Ray Dolby, the sound engineer and founder of Dolby Laboratories, said that when their family first learned their father had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the family made charitable donations to well-known groups supporting research and patients\u2019 families. After his father\u2019s death in 2013, Mr. Dolby said, the family office became more disciplined. In addition to its charitable contributions, it is financing basic research on Alzheimer\u2019s and investing in companies working on treatments that are on track for regulatory approval. Its board includes doctors and scientists who are at work on treatments for the disease. \u201cWe made a conscious decision as a family that as long as there isn\u2019t a silver bullet, we needed to think about personalized interventions and take more of a portfolio approach,\u201d Mr. Dolby said. This approach has allowed the family to find small markers of success \u2014 say, a treatment that works for 25 percent of the people in a clinical trial \u2014 and avoid getting discouraged. As Mr. Dolby put it, \u201cI\u2019ve crafted a portfolio that has this emotional hedge in it, that if we fail miserably in every one of our targeted therapies, perhaps that disappointment is offset in the tools we\u2019re supporting.\u201d He added, \u201cAny failure has to be learned from.\u201d For medical ethicists, wealthy people coming in and funding research to benefit their children or relatives is a complicated proposition. David Wendler, who heads the research ethics section in the bioethics department at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, said nongovernment funding of research was nothing new, with some 70 percent of the money coming from private, for-profit companies. He said he welcomed the charitable and investment dollars of these family offices. \u201cThese things are hard,\u201d Dr. Wendler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like someone knows how to do this and says, \u2018I just need money to do it.\u2019 We need to try different approaches.\u201d But he had some concerns that in their haste to help family members some family offices might not follow the proper protocols. \u201cYou want to protect the validity of the studies and you want to make sure you protect the subjects participating in these clinical trials,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m imagining what happens if I have my billion dollars and I fund a clinical trial for some disease my son has. And then we screen my son and he\u2019s not eligible for it. I say, \u2018Hey, I want my son in.\u2019\u201d He added that there were also public policy implications to wealthy people\u2019s funding research for certain diseases over others. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant value in having the American public funding these diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cThese philanthropists are doing great things, but their targets are going to be a function of what their daughter got. Sometimes that\u2019s going to overlap with what the public needs. Sometimes that\u2019s just not going to match up with the priorities that come out of the diseases other people get.\u201d Professional wealth managers suggest that people seeking to make progress against a disease cast a wide net. Judy Spalthoff, head of family advisory services for UBS Wealth Management in the Americas, said she worked with a client to expand her network beyond her hometown, Houston. \u201cFrom her perspective, she wasn\u2019t networked at all, but she had the dollars,\u201d Ms. Spalthoff said. \u201cNow she has this crazy network. That\u2019s highly effective.\u201d Billy and Jennifer Frist, whose wealth comes from the Hospital Corporation of America (founded by Billy\u2019s grandfather), have a 16-year-old son with autism. Despite the resources of their family office \u2014 and of their relatives, who include former Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a physician \u2014 they said they struggled for ways to help both their own son and the cause of autism research. \u201cIt was hard for us to figure out how to get involved, where to get involved, how to be effective,\u201d Ms. Frist said. \u201cThe autism community is large but very fragmented. Everyone has these opinions and is trying to make a difference, but people are living in their silos.\u201d Another challenge \u2014 for those who choose to take it on \u2014 is going public about what would normally be a private battle with a disease. Ms. Anane said she initially wanted to keep her family\u2019s condition secret, but then decided to speak out to draw attention to the disease. She spoke at a conference at Harvard Medical School this month under the auspices of its Personal Genetics Education Project. After the conference, she said, she was hopeful that some Alzheimer\u2019s research might be applicable to C.J.D. \u201cI try in as many ways as I can to make progress,\u201d Ms. Anane said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rely on one option and say, \u2018We\u2019ll keep our faith in this.\u2019 I\u2019m trying to get everywhere I can, to try to connect and see.\u201d The Frists said that when it came to investing their money, they had focused on companies working on treatments in the later stages of approval. For instance, the Frists have made a $20 million investment in a biopharmaceutical company called Curemark, which is testing an enzyme replacement therapy that had shown promise in reducing the symptoms of autism. Ms. Frist said the drug worked best with younger children, and was thus unlikely to help their son. They remain hopeful for other advances. Many families have no idea if they have time on their side. At 46, Ms. Anane remains healthy \u2014 as do her siblings, nieces and nephews. But Creutzfeldt-Jakob is mercurial: She had a cousin with the gene mutation who was healthy at 93, but who had watched her daughter and granddaughter die from the disease. Then the cousin\u2019s 86-year-old brother died from it. \u201cI want to find a solution,\u201d Ms. Anane said. \u201cI have a greater mission to bring some new revelation to the world.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/your-money/bringing-family-wealth-to-bear-against-a-relentless-illness.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Your Money", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T14:36:40-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T14:36:40-04:00", "abstract": "Family offices, which manage money for rich clans, sometimes throw their considerable weight behind efforts to tackle an illness afflicting one or more relatives.", "title": "Bringing Family Wealth to Bear Against a Relentless Illness"}
