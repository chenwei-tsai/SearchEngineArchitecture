{"abstract": "Richard Silvestri keeps us guessing with a fun weekend diversion.", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "VARIETY PUZZLE \u2014 I\u2019ve confessed this before, but for the sake of those who are new here, I\u2019ll do it again: When I first took over Wordplay, I had never solved a cryptic crossword puzzle. Like all puzzle solving, the skill grows the more you solve, and I really love them now. After a full week of solving American-style crossword puzzles, it\u2019s nice to work your brain in a different way. What that means is that, with some practice, you can do them too. Of course, you won\u2019t be driven by the panic and the abject fear of very public failure that I was, but I\u2019m sure you can find your own source of motivation. One of the things I love about cryptics is the variety of types of clues. They might all sound like gibberish upon first read, but they are asking you to do different things. The simplest, for me, are the soundalikes: at 23A, the clue is \u201cFrog sound heard by you and me is a sign of spring (6)\u201d, so all you need to do is put the sounds for CROAK and US (you and me) together, and you get that beautiful flower of spring, the CROCUS. At 18A, the clue \u201cOver five hundred on Ecstasy\u201d very cleverly hides a lot of information, including a synonym for the word \u201cover,\u201d the Roman numeral for 500 and a street name for the drug Ecstasy. The answer is DONE (a synonym of \u201cover\u201d) and here\u2019s why: D is the Roman numeral for 500, and the phrase \u201cD ON E\u201d can be read as \u201c500 on Ecstasy.\u201d Now let\u2019s look at 6D. The clue is \u201cA soldier holds out rodent (6),\u201d and the answer is AGOUTI. How did Mr. Silvestri come up with that? Well, an AGOUTI is a rodent, and if you \u201chold\u201d the word OUT from it, you get \u201cA G. I.\u201d That\u2019s your soldier holding out the rodent. That\u2019s enough to get you started. Keep practicing and you might fall for cryptics, too.
