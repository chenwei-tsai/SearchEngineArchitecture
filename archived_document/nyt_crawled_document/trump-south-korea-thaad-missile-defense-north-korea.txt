{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 President Trump\u2019s remarks that he wants South Korea to pay for a missile defense system being set up there jolted the country\u2019s presidential race on Friday and surprised the government, leaving it scrambling to figure out the intentions of a close ally. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Mr. Trump said that he wanted South Korea to pay for the system, known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, whose cost he estimated at $1 billion. He also said that he wanted to renegotiate or terminate what he called a \u201chorrible\u201d trade agreement with South Korea because of a deep trade deficit. \u201cVery soon,\u201d he said when asked when he would announce his intention to renegotiate the pact. \u201cI\u2019m announcing it now.\u201d In South Korea, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments shook the race to choose a successor to Park Geun-hye, the former president who was formally ousted last month after being impeached by Parliament in December. The election is on May 9. Ms. Park\u2019s decision to accept the Thaad deployment has been a dominant campaign issue, with Moon Jae-in, the leading candidate, calling for an immediate halt to the system\u2019s deployment and vowing to review it if elected. \u201cWe must consider whether it conforms to the spirit of the alliance,\u201d Youn Kwan-suk, Mr. Moon\u2019s spokesman, said in a statement about Mr. Trump\u2019s demand, accusing him of acting \u201cunilaterally and without close bilateral consultations.\u201d Mr. Moon had already said it was wrong for Ms. Park\u2019s government to have accepted the Thaad deployment without first seeking parliamentary approval. On Friday, after Mr. Trump\u2019s comment reached South Korea, Mr. Moon\u2019s campaign headquarters reiterated that whoever wins the May election should review, along with the National Assembly, Ms. Park\u2019s decision to accept the missile defense system and determine whether deploying it was in South Korea\u2019s national interest. The gap between Mr. Trump\u2019s comments and what South Koreans have been told by their government about the cost of the deployment \u201cmakes it clear that there was a serious flaw in the decision to deploy Thaad,\u201d Mr. Youn said on Friday. Contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, South Korea has repeatedly said that it would provide the land and build the base needed for the Thaad missile battery and that the United States would pay for the deployment, operation and maintenance of the system, which was purchased from Lockheed Martin. On Friday, the South Korean Defense Ministry said it was not changing that stance. Some wondered whether the government had made a secret agreement under which South Korea would help pay for the system. The government must clarify whether Mr. Trump\u2019s comments reflect his \u201cunilateral wishful thinking\u201d or whether there is such a deal that has not been shared with the public, Son Kum-ju, a spokesman of the opposition People\u2019s Party, said on Friday. The party\u2019s top leader, Ahn Cheol-soo, is running second, behind Mr. Moon, in pre-election polls. This week, the United States and South Korean militaries began installing the radar and other crucial components of Thaad in Seongju, 135 miles southeast of Seoul, the South Korean capital. South Korean and American officials said the system would become operational soon, despite protests from China, which sees the deployment as a threat to its security. Both the United States and South Korea said Thaad was aimed at defending South Korean and American troops in South Korea from North Korea\u2019s ballistic missiles. But South Koreans  are deeply divided over the missile defense system. After a series of ballistic missile tests by North Korea in recent months, conservative politicians hailed the deployment as a powerful symbol of the United States\u2019 commitment to the defense of South Korea. But many liberal opposition lawmakers have questioned the wisdom of the deployment, which has strained ties with China, the South\u2019s biggest trading partner. They said that Thaad had infuriated the Chinese so much that they were boycotting South Korean brands and that Beijing may now be less willing to use economic leverage to rein in the North\u2019s weapons programs. On Friday, the South Korean Trade Ministry was equally stunned by Mr. Trump\u2019s comment about renegotiating or ending the trade deal with the United States. It said it had not been notified of any American plan to revise the five-year-old pact. During the campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized a range of trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement as well as the South Korean-American trade pact, saying that they took jobs from American workers. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s first acts as president was to formally withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which had been an important pillar of the Obama administration\u2019s trade policy in the region. Mr. Trump has also accused South Korea and Japan of not paying enough for an American military presence. More recently, South Koreans have grown anxious over repeated warnings from Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides that military options are not off the table in Washington\u2019s dealing with North Korea. Some Koreans fear that the United States might attack North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities, setting off a war that could devastate Seoul. Mr. Trump also raised some eyebrows in South Korea by saying that Korea used to be \u201cpart of China.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/world/asia/trump-south-korea-thaad-missile-defense-north-korea.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T06:47:58-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T06:47:58-04:00", "abstract": "The president\u2019s comment about Thaad, which is being deployed to defend against North Korea, shook the South\u2019s presidential race ahead of the election in May.", "title": "Trump Rattles South Korea by Saying It Should Pay for Antimissile System"}
