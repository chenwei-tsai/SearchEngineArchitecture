{"abstract": "As social media sites add more types of content, critics say it\u2019s time they learn to better police what is posted.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "The technology industry is fond of its anodyne language: Customers are \u201cusers.\u201d Videos and stories are \u201ccontent.\u201d Putting other people out of business is \u201cdisruption.\u201d But word choices meant to cause the least offense fail to prevent the visceral reaction that occurs after someone posts a video of a killing to Facebook. That is not content. That is a snuff film. On Easter, a man in Cleveland shot and killed another man and posted a video of it to Facebook. The video \u2014 and the two hours Facebook took to remove it \u2014 provoked intense criticism of the social media giant. Facebook is hardly the only social media company struggling to deal with lurid material posted by its users. Twitter and YouTube have struggled to block violent videos and other postings by terrorists. And YouTube has lost a number of advertisers because of its inability to prevent their ads from appearing next to offensive material. There are also many examples of beatings and other assaults that are posted for the amusement of the perpetrators and their friends. Social networks have made great strides in recent years in their efforts to block pornography, and artificial intelligence may help block violent material. But there is no easy answer, other than rigorous self-policing by users. For now, telling a machine to recognize nudity is a lot easier than telling it recognize that an assault is taking place.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/technology/daily-report-facebook-struggles-with-being-responsible.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T14:22:39-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Daily Report: Facebook Struggles With Being Responsible", "created_date": "2017-04-18T14:22:39-04:00", "section": "Technology"}
