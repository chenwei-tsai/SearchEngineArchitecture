He has embraced social media much more than his predecessors, but he also warned in a 2016 encyclical that the omnipresence of digital communications \u201ccan stop people from learning how to live wisely, to think deeply and to love generously.\u201d The pope urged wealthy and powerful people to show solidarity with the poor and powerless, particularly migrants. \u201cI, myself, was born in a family of migrants,\u201d Francis said. \u201cMy father, my grandparents, like many other Italians, left for Argentina and met the fate of those who are left with nothing. I could have very well ended up among today\u2019s discarded people. And that\u2019s why I always ask myself, deep in my heart: \u2018Why them and not me?\u2019\u201d TED \u2014 which stands for technology, entertainment and design \u2014 is a media company that streams and broadcasts lectures by notable people and organizes conferences built around those lectures. The talks have become a kind of secular sermon, and they are often delivered, cited and quoted by prominent Silicon Valley figures and those who follow their activities. Other speakers who are addressing this week\u2019s conference include Serena Williams and the entrepreneur Elon Musk. The pope\u2019s 18-minute talk, which was recorded at the Vatican, was similar in style to those of other TED speakers. He addressed the conference in Italian, speaking from behind a desk, using plain language and personal anecdotes. The talk can be viewed on TED\u2019s website, where by midday Wednesday it had already been watched more than 300,000 times. Francis\u2019 message of hope came with an admonition. \u201cPlease allow me to say it loud and clear: The more powerful you are, the more your actions will have an impact on people, the more you are called to be humble,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, your power will ruin you, and you will ruin others.\u201d Francis is the first pope to address the conference, and booking him was not easy. \u201cIt took many discussions to make the talk happen \u2014 and several trips to Rome over more than a year,\u201d Bruno Giussani, TED\u2019s international curator, wrote in a blog post. \u201cWhen I first approached the Vatican, it\u2019s fair to say that not many there knew of TED. So there was a lot of explaining to do.\u201d", "created_date": "2017-04-26T12:13:04-04:00", "section": "World", "abstract": "The pope made his remarks in a recorded video talk that was shown Tuesday at the TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.", "item_type": "Article"}
