{"text": "A rarity in a business like fashion, where fairy-tale transports are most often town cars, the story of Edward Enninful, recently named the next editor of British Vogue, began on the London tube. Born in Ghana and raised in Ladbroke Grove, an unglamorous neighborhood in west London, Mr. Enninful was discovered in 1989 on the Hammersmith and City Line by the fashion stylist Simon Foxton. It was not necessarily a fashion sighting. Mr. Foxton recalled Mr. Enninful in those early days in an ever-present duffel coat and National Health-style glasses, the arms of which would occasionally be mended with tape. Still, Mr. Foxton said in a recent interview: \u201cHe must have had something about him. I don\u2019t stop that many people.\u201d Mr. Enninful went home and asked his mother\u2019s permission to model for Mr. Foxton. He had to. He was all of 16. Duly, if reluctantly, permitted, the teenager appeared in a shoot done by Mr. Foxton and the photographer Nick Knight, for i-D magazine, the upstart London style bible. He was transfixed. He quickly went from Mr. Foxton\u2019s model to his assistant. \u201cI seem to remember he said he was wanting to go to college to do law,\u201d Mr. Foxton said, \u201cBut once he saw the bright lights of fashion, he thought, \u2018Oh, well, forget that.\u2019\u201d So began a nearly three-decade career in fashion, which has taken Mr. Enninful, now 45, from the chaotic offices of i-D to fashion shows and photo shoots the world over to \u2014 as of this August, when he and his partner, the filmmaker Alec Maxwell, will relocate to London \u2014 the tony doorstep of Vogue House in Hanover Square. His appointment represents a timely rupture with tradition. He is a gay black man in a position that has been held for 100 years by a white woman, for the last 25 by the departing editor, Alexandra Shulman. \u201cIt does show that there is a God,\u201d said Mr. Knight, who continues to work with Mr. Enninful. \u201cHe\u2019s broken that mold. I think that offers a lot of hope for people who see fashion as something they couldn\u2019t ever get into, that they\u2019d be shut out from.\u201d Mr. Enninful, who declined to be interviewed for this article, may have been little more than a lad from Ladbroke Grove at the outset, but he happened down one of London fashion\u2019s most fertile and febrile rabbit holes. I-D had been founded a few years earlier by Terry Jones, a former British Vogue art director who struck out on his own to document a London that was truer to what he saw in the streets than in Vogue\u2019s high-gloss pages. Its Covent Garden office was a magnet for ambitious young talent, which Mr. Jones assessed without overmuch regard for age, station or experience. Mr. Foxton compared it with a drop-in center. Money was a secondary concern, and a spirit of can-do reigned. Mr. Enninful came with Mr. Foxton, and for some 20 years, stayed. \u201cHe was basically soaking up what he needed to set himself up,\u201d said Judy Blame, a stylist and jewelry designer who contributed to i-D. \u201cI suppose we were his mad college.\u201d Mr. Blame invited Mr. Enninful to move into his house, which belonged to the singer Neneh Cherry; Mr. Enninful stayed a year. Mr. Enninful distinguished himself early, and when i-D\u2019s fashion editor left for another magazine not long after, Mr. Jones appointed him to succeed her \u2014 despite the fact that he was 18 years old. \u201cIt\u2019s gut instinct,\u201d Mr. Jones said of the choice. \u201cThe nature of i-D was to start people who didn\u2019t already work with major magazines, usually at the beginning of their careers, and then just give them support. I always wanted that energy, that fresh beginning, when people have got their eyes open and are prepared to take risks.\u201d Suddenly Mr. Enninful was a person to be reckoned with. Mr. Blame took him to Paris to see the runway collections there for the first time. They cadged shelter from friends and slept on the hotel-room floors of better-budgeted editors. I-D was a favorite of the designers on the cutting edge. \u201cAll the designers that I knew gave us really good tickets,\u201d Mr. Blame said. \u201cIt caused a bit of a stir: \u2018Who is that boy with Judy?\u2019 \u2018Oh, he\u2019s the new editor of i-D.\u2019 There weren\u2019t that many black faces in the front row.\u201d \u201cHe was a bit nervous, to tell you the truth,\u201d Mr. Blame added. \u201cI was glad to be there to hold his hand and say, \u2018You\u2019re the bloody editor of i-D! Jean Paul\u2019s given us front row, come on. Helmut wants to see you afterward.\u2019\u201d Mr. Enninful adapted quickly. Soon he and the magazine were attracting new attention. He met Naomi Campbell, who said he is like a brother to her, at a shoot for i-D in Paris in 1993. \u201cI\u2019d heard of him,\u201d she said, and when she arrived on set, \u201cI loved his style, I loved his personality, I just loved him.\u201d \u201cAny model will tell you, to this day,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when Edward was at i-D \u2014 they never had a big budget \u2014 but no matter what, if Edward called, the girls would jump on a plane and do it. We knew it was going to be a great story, creatively. We wanted to be part of it.\u201d He was promoted at i-D, and bigger commissions followed. Mr. Enninful began a long and fruitful collaboration with Steven Meisel at Italian Vogue, and Grace Coddington paved the way for a contributing position at the American edition. He styled major fashion shows and high-paying ad campaigns, including Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and Dior. It was not a transition without growing pains. Mr. Enninful\u2019s appearance in \u201cThe September Issue,\u201d the 2009 documentary about the making of the year\u2019s largest issue of Vogue, painted him as a journeyman stylist, whose work gets scrapped for not living up to Anna Wintour\u2019s high standards. \u201cWhere\u2019s the glamour?\u201d she is seen demanding in one scene. \u201cIt\u2019s Vogue, O.K.? Please, let\u2019s lift it.\u201d (Ms. Wintour called Mr. Enninful\u2019s British Vogue appointment a \u201cbrilliant choice.\u201d) But Mr. Enninful also had plenty of triumphs, often with Mr. Meisel, from their famous plastic-surgery sendup to Italian Vogue\u2019s history-making 2008 Black Issue, featuring only models of color, for which Mr. Enninful was one of a handful of collaborating stylists. A growing number of models and celebrities were impressed by his warmth and ease (products, his collaborators say, of intense preparation and research). \u201cMost times people in his position, they\u2019re pushing a brand on you or pushing an agenda on you,\u201d said the musician Pharrell Williams. \u201cThe only thing Edward ever pushes is the best part of who you are to come out, to be photographed and to take charge. The most presidential section of your essence \u2014 he knows how to find that. That\u2019s a unique talent.\u201d In 2011, Mr. Enninful left i-D and Vogue to become fashion and style director of W magazine. The British Fashion Awards gave him the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator in 2014, and he was named an Officer of the British Empire in 2016. \u201cI was so terrified I was going to be late for him, I set the clock an hour ahead of time,\u201d said Ms. Campbell, who has a famously self-determined approach to punctuality. She accompanied him to the ceremony, and co-hosted a celebration for him afterward at Mark\u2019s Club, attended by Kate Moss and Madonna. The honor was intended in part to recognize Mr. Enninful\u2019s service to diversity in the fashion industry, a cause that is both personal and longstanding. In 2013, he addressed the issue head-on, when he tweeted his displeasure at a seating assignment during the haute couture shows: \u201cIf all my (white) counterparts are seated in the front row, why should I be expected to take 2nd row? racism? xoxo.\u201d It quickly went viral. In a subsequent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Enninful declined to identify the designer whose show he had left, and said: \u201cChange always takes time. The fashion industry needs to breed a whole different way of thinking. We need more diverse people working in all facets of the industry.\u201d But more often he has expressed his commitment to diversity through his work, in particular by championing models of color in his photo shoots and fashion shows. \u201cThere are so many girls that have had an opportunity because of Edward,\u201d said the designer Brandon Maxwell, a former assistant of Mr. Enninful\u2019s. The truth is, there is scarcely more diversity in fashion today than there was when Mr. Enninful was himself a model in the late 1980s, and indeed maybe less, as the London scene from which he emerged drew voraciously and promiscuously from the intermingled worlds of music, art and club culture as well as the narrower milieu of fashion. \u201cIn today\u2019s media, we often see tokenism and gimmicks, what I call forced diversity,\u201d said Joe Casely-Hayford, the longtime London-based designer, who is black. \u201cWhat Edward stands for, he\u2019s in a league of his own when it comes to championing diversity, and different notions of beauty in a consistent, relevant and authentic way.\u201d Mr. Casely-Hayford credited this to Mr. Enninful\u2019s education at i-D, and to his own background. The standard-bearers of London fashion in the 20th century, he said, ticking off Vivienne Westwood, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, \u201ccame with a fearlessness that you couldn\u2019t find in the leafy suburbs.\u201d \u201cI think Edward is cut from the same cloth,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn order to progress, we need to challenge the status quo. This is something that Edward will bring to Vogue. It\u2019s the real essence of fashion \u2014 it\u2019s fashion, not frocks. Nowadays, you see pages and pages of frocks.\u201d This is perhaps particularly true of British Vogue, which, despite its eminence, has lagged behind in both the reach of its American cousin and the boundary-pushing radicalism of its Italian and, to a lesser degree, French counterparts. It is seen by many in the industry as a quainter, more commercial and prettier, but less pathbreaking, magazine than some photographers would like. Across the board, photography in particular has suffered. Compressed shooting schedules, budgets and pressure from advertisers have bred timidity from editors and compromised the more creative work of years past. \u201cI think for a long time in Vogue magazine you haven\u2019t seen a real support for fashion photography,\u201d Mr. Knight said, \u201cwhich is sort of odd, because fashion photography is the reason Vogue magazine exists.\u201d Mr. Enninful, on the other hand, is devoted to the photographers he works with (besides Mr. Knight and Mr. Meisel, they include Steven Klein, Craig McDean, Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott and Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, among many others) and beloved by them in return. His shoots are intensive, baroque productions \u2014 Rihanna as a queen in peace and in war, Ms. Moss as an enameled nun \u2014 and he represents, his collaborators hope, a return to a more photography-driven British Vogue. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who\u2019s primarily concerned with the picture being amazing,\u201d Ms. van Lamsweerde said. \u201c He really is the best collaborator I know.\u201d In an industry still haunted by stereotypical devils, tyrants and snobs, Mr. Enninful leaves an unusual trail of good vibes in his wake. Still, even to his friends, news of his appointment was a happy surprise. The rumor mill had been churning, but Mr. Enninful\u2019s name was usually mentioned after current and former British Vogue staffers \u2014 among them Emily Sheffield and Jo Ellison \u2014 whose profiles more closely fit the established archetype. \u201cWe went bowling on my birthday just recently and he didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d said Marc Jacobs, a close friend, who was with Mr. Enninful the day before the announcement was made. \u201cHe said, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to take away from your day.\u2019 That sums up what kind of person he is.\u201d Mr. Enninful\u2019s original collaborators said they were delighted by the news. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve seen his career trajectory and now it seems almost inevitable,\u201d Mr. Foxton said. \u201cBut back then, if you\u2019d told me? I wouldn\u2019t have believed you.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/fashion/from-ghana-to-hanover-square.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T05:00:18-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T05:00:18-04:00", "abstract": "The unlikely, barrier-breaking journey that has led Edward Enninful, the new editor of British Vogue, to one of the most powerful positions in fashion.", "title": "From Ghana to Hanover Square"}
