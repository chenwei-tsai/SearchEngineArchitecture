He was 76. An assistant, Linda Lyon, said the cause was non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. In the roles of talent agent and then manager, Mr. Gallin had few peers as a behind-the-scenes ally to the biggest stars, from the time he helped rescue Dolly Parton from a stalling career in 1976 until the day Elizabeth Taylor died in 2011 and, in her will, left him her biggest amethyst crystal. He was part of the team that booked the Beatles for their first appearance on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d (1964). He woke up in the middle of the night to Richard Pryor calling from jail (twice in 1967). He oversaw Cher\u2019s transformation from rock balladeer to disco dancing club diva (1978). He signed Whoopi Goldberg before she auditioned for Steven Spielberg and got the leading role in\u201cThe Color Purple\u201d (1984). He jetted to London with Ms. Taylor to stage a painkiller intervention for another of his clients, Michael Jackson (1993). And by serving as executive producer of the Oscar-winning documentary \u201cCommon Threads: Stories From the Quilt\u201d (1990), which profiled people represented in the AIDS Memorial Quilt, and by appearing on the cover of Out Magazine\u2019s annual Power Issue (1994), he became something of a role model for gays and lesbians in the entertainment business at a time when few in prominent positions, and virtually no one in front of the camera, acknowledged being gay. Mr. Gallin was also one of Hollywood\u2019s most celebrated hosts, holding swanky soirees at dozens of multimillion-dollar estates that as part of an enormously successful second career, he bought, built, spruced up and sold to Hollywood luminaries, including the record executive Jimmy Iovine, the movie executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and the reality television king Mark Burnett. At a party Mr. Gallin gave in his Bel Air home honoring Hugh Jackman the weekend Mr. Jackman hosted the Oscars in 2009, Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King were in the library, admiring the pale wood bookshelves, where literary works were organized not alphabetically or according to subject but by color. Down in the kitchen standing at the buffet line with Diane von Furstenberg was Barbra Streisand, a client from the \u201990s. Did Mr. Gallin mention that they were at a kind of open house, that his place was on the market for $32 million, having been finished within minutes of the financial crisis? He certainly didn\u2019t hide it. \u201cPeople would come around and say how much they loved the house, and he\u2019d say, \u2018An offer! How about an offer?\u2019\u201d said his friend Paula Weinstein. Mr. Gallin may have worked on the business end of show business, but he was arguably his own best creation, an unapologetic bon vivant with a spiky mop of dark hair, black glasses and, as a native of Brooklyn, that borough\u2019s signature drawl, which friends like Sarah Jessica Parker and Andy Cohen mimicked to great effect. His favorite meal was dessert. His preferred parking spot was a no-standing zone. \u201cI can eat, work and have sex no matter how depressed, no matter how unhappy I am,\u201d Mr. Gallin once told Vanity Fair. \u201cHe was just a guy who reveled in all that stuff, parties and movie stars and pop stars,\u201d said his close friend David Geffen. \u201cHe grew up wanting all that and he got all that.\u201d Devoid of cynicism, Mr. Gallin was a transmission device for \u201csunshine and optimism,\u201d said Barry Diller. To become a star was to remain one in his eyes. Practically the only clients friends recall him firing were the guys from Milli Vanilli. \u201cEverything connected to him was exuberance and indulgence in a way that can\u2019t be characterized as anything but good,\u201d Ms. Parker said. His death, she added, \u201cis a terrible loss in the joy department.\u201d Albert Samuel Gallin was born in Brooklyn on May 27, 1940, and raised on Long Island, in Lawrence, where his father, Sidney, was a builder with a spending problem and his mother, Florence, was a homemaker. \u201cAs soon as I could speak, I talked about having millions of dollars, knowing famous people and becoming a star,\u201d Mr. Gallin told the writer Ingrid Sischy in a cover article in Architectural Digest in 2014. After graduating from Boston University, Mr. Gallin returned to New York and started in the mailroom of General Artists Corporation, which eventually became International Creative Management, one of the largest agencies. He was promoted to agent in 1965. One of his first clients was also his most difficult: Mr. Pryor. The first time Mr. Pryor phoned Mr. Gallin from jail, he had been arrested on charges of transporting marijuana across the Mexican border into California. The second time, he had slugged a desk attendant at a motel, according to Richard Zoglin\u2019s book \u201cComedy at the Edge: How Stand-Up in the 1970s Changed America.\u201d This was good training for managing great talents with fragile psyches. \u201cHe understood or accepted that as being endemic to the whole thing,\u201d Jennifer Pryor, Mr. Pryor\u2019s widow, said of Mr. Gallin. Or shunted them aside. \u201cHe didn\u2019t see these things; he didn\u2019t want to see these things,\u201d Mr. Geffen said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t true for him.\u201d In 1968, G.A.C. moved Mr. Gallin to Los Angeles. There was a brief marriage to a woman (\u201cI told her I was gay before,\u201d he later said), after which he switched from working as an agent, which is focused on deal making, to managing, which is focused on overall strategy and hand-holding. A brief marriage to Bryan Fox, with whom he was involved for six years, ended in 2015. His brother, Henry, died in 2015. He left no immediate survivors. With his cousin Ray Katz, a veteran talent representative, Mr. Gallin launched Katz Gallin Associates and began amassing a client roster that included Joan Rivers, Florence Henderson, Cher, Lily Tomlin and Patti LaBelle. He became best friends with Mr. Diller, Mr. Geffen and Calvin Klein. In the mid-1970s, another client, the singer Mac Davis, received a phone call from Ms. Parton, who was struggling in her country music career and wanted advice. Mr. Davis suggested that she reach out to Mr. Gallin. Mr. Gallin helped set her up with the record producer Charles Koppelman, who oversaw her first crossover hit, \u201cHere You Come Again.\u201d She and Mr. Gallin became inseparable. Mr. Gallin helped Ms. Parton open the theme park Dollywood in Tennessee and started a company with her, Sandollar Productions, which was responsible for the Steve Martin film \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d and the hit television series \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer.\u201d For a time, Ms. Parson and Mr. Gallin even shared an apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. \u201cNobody could quite get how the Christian Southern girl and the New York Jewish boy and could have so much in common,\u201d Ms. Parton said in an interview this week. \u201cBut it was real.\u201d She found him irresistible. \u201cMy husband didn\u2019t love to travel, and Sandy was gay and did,\u201d she said. Plus, she added, \u201che knew everybody.\u201d In 1983, after deciding to see if Mr. Gallin\u2019s vivacity and connections might lend themselves to an on-camera career, Mr. Diller helped persuade NBC to give him a three-night stint doing a variety show, \u201cLive \u2026 and in Person.\u201d The premiere was set for Sept. 27 as the lead-in to \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d \u201cOnce it had been ordered, Sandy went into deep surgical remix,\u201d Mr. Diller said. \u201cHe had every part of himself fixed. I said, \u2018Sandy, no one cares.\u2019 It\u2019s about being the Ed Sullivan of that moment. I think he must have had 10 tuxedos made.\u201d This turned out to be unnecessary. The network declined to order more episodes. \u201cIt was just no good,\u201d said Mr. Diller. \u201cBut he had a great time.\u201d Except for one thing. The show debuted the same week that another client of Mr. Gallin\u2019s, Joan Rivers, was substituting for Johnny Carson as the \u201cTonight\u201d host. She found it nearly impossible to book guests because everyone she wanted was appearing on her manager\u2019s glitzy debut. Furious, Ms. Rivers fired Mr. Gallin as her manager and walked away with hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions in dispute. Mr. Gallin sued, and she paid him back, according to Billy Sammeth, who worked for Mr. Gallin in the 1970s and the 1980s, when he left the firm, taking as his first two clients Ms. Rivers and Cher. But new stars kept coming \u2014 along with new requests. Shortly after bagging Mr. Jackson as a client, Mr. Gallin and his staff were asked to get him a knighthood from the Queen of England. \u201cI think Michael figured that if he were knighted, all the child-abuse rumors would go away,\u201d said Alana Scott, a longtime assistant to Mr. Gallin. \u201cSandy tried. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d Sometimes, the egos got to him, and Mr. Gallin dealt with the stress with masseuses, chiropractors, rolfers and personal trainers. He delved into self-improvement: EST, Lifespring, Courses in Miracles, Transcendental Meditation, kabbalah, Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra and the Power of Now. \u201cHe tried it all,\u201d Mr. Geffen said. \u201cParticularly if stars went there.\u201d In 1997, Mr. Gallin was representing the singer Mariah Carey and took his friend, the architect Scott Mitchell, to a meeting with her associates about a coming concert tour. Mr. Mitchell recalled people sitting around having a \u201c30-minute-long conversation about what kind of Coke she needed in her fridge.\u201d Afterward, Mr. Mitchell \u2014 who went on to work with Mr. Gallin in real estate \u2014 asked his friend how he could bear such meetings. \u201cHe just laughed,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. But Mr. Gallin was thinking the same thing himself. It wasn\u2019t always easy being, as Mr. Cohen described him, \u201cthe great neutralizer.\u201d So in 1998, when Mr. Gallin received an offer from his friend, the Las Vegas hotel magnate Steve Wynn, to bring Broadway shows to the desert, he accepted. The venture was short-lived, however: He hated living in Las Vegas, and he soon returned to Los Angeles. By then he had begun flipping homes. Around 2001, Ms. Streisand was talking to Mr. Burnett, the reality TV producer, who was looking to buy a property in Malibu. She had a thunderbolt: \u201cSandy.\u201d Mr. Gallin and Mr. Mitchell had just finished a house there. Mr. Burnett ought to go see it, Ms. Streisand said. When Mr. Burnett bought it for nearly $30 million, Mr. Mitchell was happy to announce, \u201cBarbra Streisand was our Realtor!\u201d If moguls flocked to buy his clean, modern houses (think: driftwood floors, sand-colored linen sofas and heaps of American antiques), it took a little longer with a few of his old clients. Ms. Parton had been caught off guard by his decision to retire from management. That stung. \u201cWe did have that small separation for maybe three years,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt a little bit left out and lonely.\u201d She added that both had thought, \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t like not being together.\u2019 So we rekindled that friendship.\u201d And in 2010, there was Ms. Parton at Mr. Gallin\u2019s star-packed 70th birthday party at the Greenwich Village studio of his good friend Donna Karan, where the evening\u2019s entertainment included musical numbers from Mr. Jackman, Ms. LaBelle and Ms. Streisand. Delivering a toast to the guest of honor was none other than Ms. Rivers. \u201cEveryone wanted to make him happy,\u201d said the songwriter Carole Bayer Sager, who booked the evening\u2019s entertainment. \u201cThe thing that mattered to him in his will was that they throw a great, huge party, where everybody has a great time,\u201d Mr. Geffen said. \u201cThat was all he wanted.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T22:33:16-04:00", "abstract": "Among Mr. Gallin\u2019s clients were Dolly Parton, Richard Pryor, Cher, Michael Jackson and Joan Rivers, and he became a role model for gays and lesbians in entertainment.", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T23:28:40-04:00"}
