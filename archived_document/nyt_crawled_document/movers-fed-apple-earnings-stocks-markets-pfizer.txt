BP shares gained after the British oil giant reported a surge in profit for the first quarter of the year. \u201cAll of our businesses are firing on all cylinders,\u201d said Bob Dudley, the energy giant\u2019s chief executive. The company made a profit of $1.5 billion, up from a loss of $583 million in the first quarter of 2016. Mr. Dudley noted, however, that the company would have to focus on discipline. BP had cut costs as lower oil prices ate into its profits. They have since risen from below $30 a barrel in 2016 to nearer $50 a barrel. The company\u2019s shares were up about 1.5 percent by late morning. \u2014 AMIE TSANG", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/business/dealbook/movers-fed-apple-earnings-stocks-markets-pfizer.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T08:30:08-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T08:30:08-04:00", "abstract": "We followed major developments in the markets throughout the day.
