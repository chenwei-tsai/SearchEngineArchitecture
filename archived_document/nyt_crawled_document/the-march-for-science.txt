I don\u2019t want it to disappoint her. I want her to grow up to see the universe like a scientist: to follow her curiosity, learn how to practice skepticism but cultivate awe. I want her to grow up with confidence that the future belongs to those who value knowledge and understand the idea of the collective good. I will march because it is my turn to defend her future.
