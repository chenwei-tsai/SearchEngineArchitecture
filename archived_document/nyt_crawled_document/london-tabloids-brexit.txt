{"text": "LONDON \u2014 Tony Gallagher, editor of The Sun, one of Britain\u2019s most raucous and influential tabloids, looks down on the government, literally. From the height of his 12th-floor newsroom, all glass and views, the Palace of Westminster seems like a toy castle, something to be played with or ignored at will. Mr. Gallagher also looks down on the editor of the more measured Times of London, whose office is one floor below and who makes a point of keeping his blinds drawn. The hierarchy is not lost on either man. In Britain after the so-called Brexit vote, the power of the tabloids is evident. Their circulations may be falling and their reputations tarnished by a series of phone-hacking scandals. But as the country prepares to cut ties with the European Union after a noisy and sometimes nasty campaign, top politicians court the tabloids and fear their wrath. Broadcasters follow where they lead, if not in tone then in topic. Their readers, many of them over 50, working class and outside London, look strikingly like the voters who were crucial to the outcome of last year\u2019s referendum on membership in the European Union. It is these citizens of Brexitland whom the tabloids purport to represent from the heart of enemy territory: Housed in palatial dwellings in some of London\u2019s most expensive neighborhoods, they see themselves as Middle England\u2019s embassies in London. In the campaign leading up to a snap election on June 8, the tabloids can be counted on to act as the zealous guardians of Brexit and as a cheering section for the Conservative government of Prime Minister Theresa May \u2014 even though the city that houses them voted the other way. Mr. Gallagher made his mark on three of Britain\u2019s most stridently pro-Brexit newspapers. He was editor of The Daily Telegraph, a conservative broadsheet, and deputy editor of the more midmarket Daily Mail, one of The Sun\u2019s main rivals, before Rupert Murdoch poached him 20 months ago. Together, these three titles are a central reason that print coverage of the referendum campaign was skewed 80 percent to 20 percent in favor of Brexit, according to research by Loughborough University. In the marble-and-glass lobby of the 17-story News Building, home to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s British media empire, there is a small plaque that commemorates the building\u2019s 2014 opening by Boris Johnson, then the mayor of London and now the British foreign secretary. Mr. Johnson, wild-haired and witty, became a chief architect of Brexit when four months before the referendum he threw his weight behind a cause until then most closely associated with the populist U.K. Independence Party. But his main contribution to Brexit may go back more than two decades. A correspondent in Brussels for The Daily Telegraph in the early 1990s, Mr. Johnson was credited by fellow reporters with pioneering the euroskeptic coverage of the European Union that has since become the default setting for much of the British press. With little regard for the truth \u2014 he was previously fired by The Times of London for making up a quote \u2014 Mr. Johnson wrote about a Europe scheming to impose standard condom sizes and ban his country\u2019s beloved prawn-cocktail-flavored chips (both untrue). \u201cBoris invented fake news,\u201d said Martin Fletcher, a former foreign editor of The Times, who was in Brussels shortly after Mr. Johnson. \u201cHe turned euroskepticism into an art form that every news editor in London came to expect.\u201d Before the Brexit referendum, Mr. Fletcher added, \u201cBoris campaigned against the cartoon caricature of Brussels that he himself invented.\u201d The Brexit campaign was marked by a relentless drip of anti-immigration rhetoric and a couple of big lies that stuck: the 350 million pounds (about $450 million at current rates) that Britain paid to the European Union every week (false) and the prospect of millions of Turks\u2019 making their way to Britain if it stayed in the union (Turkey is not joining the bloc). Two years ago, the United Nations urged Britain to deal with hate speech in its newspapers, specifically citing a column in The Sun that compared migrants to cockroaches and the norovirus. The tabloids say they merely reflect the concerns and fears of their readers. But their critics say they poison the debate by playing to people\u2019s worst instincts and prejudices, distorting facts and creating a propaganda ramp that mainstreams intolerance and shapes policy. I had emailed Mr. Gallagher seeking an interview on March 29, the same day Britain delivered a letter to European Union leaders in Brussels formally initiating the two-year Brexit negotiations. I argued that it was difficult to understand Britain today without understanding the tabloids. He must have agreed. The elevator rose past the offices of The Wall Street Journal, the Dow Jones news agency, The Sunday Times and The Times, all the way up to The Sun\u2019s newsroom. Only Mr. Murdoch, proprietor of The Sun since 1969, sits above. At The Telegraph, Mr. Gallagher won respect for overseeing coverage of one of the biggest political scandals in recent British history: More than two dozen lawmakers resigned after the paper revealed widespread abuse of allowances and expenses that paid for, among other things, limed oak toilet seats and the clearing of a moat. But he also has a reputation for losing his temper. \u201cMail Men,\u201d a new book about The Daily Mail, where Mr. Gallagher spent much of his career, quotes former colleagues describing him as \u201cthis figure of death\u201d who \u201cput the fear of the devil into his reporters.\u201d A tall, lean figure, he guided me to a seat opposite a panoramic view of London. Throughout our conversation, he was cautious and mostly unsmiling but polite. (He called the book\u2019s depiction of him \u201cmean.\u201d) Unprompted, he pointed to a staircase and explained that The Sun\u2019s newsroom was the only one in the building with direct access to the management floor. (\u201cThey are up and down those stairs all the time,\u201d a journalist said later. \u201cThey\u201d are Mr. Murdoch, when he is in town, and his British chief, Rebekah Brooks, a former editor of The Sun and of the now-defunct News of the World who was charged with criminal offenses related to phone hacking but was cleared by a jury in 2014.) Mr. Gallagher was still enjoying the aftermath of a recent showdown with the government. The Sun had printed bumper stickers and run an eight-page special report on how a rise in national insurance contributions for self-employed people would hurt \u201cWhite Van Men,\u201d shorthand for members of the working class, who, in The Sun\u2019s view, were getting the shaft. It was the first time the tabloids had turned on the nine-month-old government of Mrs. May, and she swiftly retreated. \u201cIt took them less than a week,\u201d Mr. Gallagher recalled. He recounted the fury of David Cameron \u2014 Mrs. May\u2019s predecessor as prime minister, who called for the referendum and campaigned to stay in the European Union \u2014 when The Sun turned against him on Brexit with a blistering front-page attack. It so happened that Mr. Gallagher had a prearranged meeting with Mr. Cameron that day \u2014 \u201cJust a catch-up,\u201d the editor recalled. Mr. Cameron was cursing \u201cabout the coverage that he was getting in the early stages of the referendum,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said. \u201cHe was in a red-faced four-letter rage.\u201d \u201cI put my pen in my mouth because I thought I was going to burst out laughing,\u201d he added. At their best, Britain\u2019s irreverent tabloids report without fear or favor, aggressively holding the political elite to account. But they can be selective about whom they hound \u2014 and boastful. In 1992, when the Conservative Party unexpectedly beat Labour after a ferocious anti-Labour campaign in The Sun, the paper\u2019s headline proclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s the Sun Wot Won It.\u201d And Brexit? Was it The Sun wot won it? \u201cWe campaigned for Brexit,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t think we caused Brexit.\u201d Last June, barely an hour after the referendum results were in, he struck a very different tone in a text message to a friend at The Guardian: \u201cSo much for the waning power of the print media.\u201d According to a recent analysis by the Media Reform Coalition, a pressure group, senior executives from Murdoch-owned companies met with the prime minister or the chancellor of the Exchequer 10 times in the year ending in September, when the study was completed \u2014 more than any other media organization in the country. Yet The Sun sells only 1.6 million copies today (more than 80 percent of them outside London and the country\u2019s wealthy southeast), down from a peak of 4.7 million in the mid-1990s. It lost more than \u00a360 million, about $75 million, last year. Why are politicians still so scared? \u201cIt\u2019s a fact that print newspapers, national newspapers, set the agenda here far more effectively than broadcasters, who are essentially a reactive medium,\u201d said Mr. Gallagher, noting that newspapers can keep hitting certain issues. \u201cSo if you as a newspaper are making much of the fact that all our laws are made in Europe, eventually that permeates the national consciousness.\u201d Britain makes many of its own laws, of course. But it is an interesting choice of example. A more obvious one might have been immigration. Research by a former Times journalist, Liz Gerard, showed that tabloids pounded the immigration issue, with at least 30 hostile front-page splashes in The Daily Mail in the six months leading up to the referendum, and 15 in the Sun. The headlines \u2014 \u201cBritain\u2019s Wide Open Borders\u201d shouted The Daily Mail \u2014 often tended toward histrionic. The Sun insinuated that child refugees arriving in Britain were lying about their ages and should have dental X-rays. \u201cTell Us the Tooth,\u201d the headline read. A week earlier, I had met Kelvin MacKenzie, a former Sun editor and now columnist who was subsequently suspended for referring to a mixed-race soccer star as a \u201cgorilla.\u201d He said that the paper still reflected the \u201cbeating heart of Britain,\u201d and that Brexit was won on immigration \u201cby a thousand miles.\u201d Mr. Gallagher was more nuanced. \u201cIt was about a combination of migration, sovereignty under the broad umbrella of taking back control, and a sense that as a country we were no longer able to control our destiny,\u201d he said. The Sun, which recruits some employees straight out of high school, has an almost personal relationship with its readers, like that with a trusted friend down at the pub. Other newspapers in Mr. Murdoch\u2019s group supported remaining in the European Union, Mr. Gallagher noted, reflecting the views of their readers, including the Scottish edition of The Sun, which like Scottish voters backed Remain. \u201cIt makes commercial sense,\u201d said Mr. Gallagher. But he has also been a passionate euroskeptic for years. \u201cUndoubtedly, we fed people\u2019s enthusiasm,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said. But, he added, \u201cthe idea that we can somehow drag otherwise unwilling readers to a point of view that they don\u2019t otherwise have is delusional.\u201d Roy Greenslade, a former features editor at The Sun, disagreed. In 1975, he said, the last time Britain held a referendum on membership in what was then the European Economic Community and a time when polls suggested that most people wanted to leave, all papers (except the communist Morning Star) campaigned to stay. People voted to stay. \u201cEvery populist editor will tell you, \u2018We are merely reflecting and articulating the public views,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Greenslade, now a journalism professor at City University of London. \u201cBut they are publishing inaccuracies and distortions which help people to feel the way they\u2019re feeling.\u201d It was 2:30 p.m., and Mr. Gallagher had already mocked up Pages 3-29 of the next day\u2019s paper. He expected the front page to lead with the funeral of the police officer who had been killed in the recent Westminster terrorist attack. The officer\u2019s widow and child would appear in public for the first time, which could make for \u201cemotional\u201d pictures, the editor said. But the decision would not be made until the daily 5 p.m. Page 1 conference. Mr. Gallagher said he had once attended a news meeting at The New York Times. He was not impressed. \u201cI was shocked at how threadbare and how little actual discussion there was in the meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no energy, there was no creativity. It could not have been more desultory and perfunctory, the discussion. It was awful.\u201d The Sun\u2019s news meetings are much more \u201clively,\u201d he said. O.K., I said. Could I attend the Sun meeting that afternoon? He stiffened. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inner-sanctum meeting.\u201d A what? \u201cWe have lawyers in the meeting.\u201d he explained. He added, \u201cWe try our headlines there. It\u2019s quite a creative meeting.\u201d Britain\u2019s tabloids pride themselves on their \u201ccreativity.\u201d Perhaps The Sun\u2019s most brazen front-page claim last year was \u201cQueen Backs Brexit,\u201d a headline later ruled misleading by Britain\u2019s press regulator. The Sun\u2019s unchallenged king of \u201ccreative\u201d headlines is Mr. MacKenzie, once the paper\u2019s editor. Some of the meeting rooms are now named after his most memorable creations, like \u201cGotcha,\u201d his take on the sinking of an Argentine warship during the Falklands War that killed more than 300 people, and \u201cUp Yours Delors,\u201d telling Jacques Delors, then the president of the European Commission, where to stick a proposed new European currency. I had met Mr. MacKenzie a week earlier to ask about those headlines. \u201cYour front pages were sometimes funny and sometimes outrageous,\u201d I began, at which point he interrupted and said, \u201cAnd sometimes untrue!\u201d Wow. I asked what headline he would like to see in the paper were he still in charge. \u201cI think the fake news headline that would give this country the most joy,\u201d he replied cheerfully, \u201cwould be \u2018Jeremy Corbyn Knifed to Death by an Asylum Seeker.\u2019\u201d Mr. Corbyn is the leader of the Labour Party. Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s fake news headline inevitably brought to mind the murder of Jo Cox, a pro-Remain Labour lawmaker who was killed by a man with far-right sympathies a week before the June referendum. Her death prompted a lot of soul-searching over whether the tone of the campaign had encouraged hate crimes. (The next morning, I got a text message from Mr. MacKenzie: \u201cHi Katrin, Can you change that perfect headline from \u2018Jeremy Corbyn knifed to death by asylum seeker\u2019 to \u2018Jeremy Corbyn Defrauded by Asylum Seeker.\u2019 In the light of Jo Cox murder mine is in tol poor taste.\u201d) Mr. Gallagher left for his \u201cinner-sanctum meeting\u201d but promised to brief me later. Meanwhile, I wandered up to the canteen on the 14th floor. The servers were all Southern European. An assistant chef strolling by said the kitchen staff was mostly foreign-born, too. He could not imagine how they would staff the kitchen after Brexit. \u201cIt will be chaos,\u201d he said. It was 5:40 p.m. The lineup for the next day\u2019s front page had been decided. The photos of the police officer\u2019s funeral were found \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d for a full-page splash. A soccer player, Ross Barkley, who had been beaten up in a nightclub and who would later become the subject of Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s gorilla column, was the main story. The headline: \u201cBarkley\u2019s Spank.\u201d My time was up. Mr. Gallagher had kept his poker face all afternoon. The only time I thought he had shifted in his seat was when I asked about his children\u2019s views on Brexit. Two were too young to vote, he said, but his oldest, who is 21, cast her ballot for Remain. He accompanied me to the door. \u201cDon\u2019t stitch me up,\u201d he said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/europe/london-tabloids-brexit.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T07:45:12-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T07:45:12-04:00", "abstract": "Despite their falling circulations and tarnished reputations, tabloids maintain a striking grip on power as Britain prepares to cut ties with the European Union.", "title": "London Tabloids, Guardians of \u2018Brexit,\u2019 Loom Large"}
