For the exhibition, which runs through Oct. 29, the Seattle glassmaker Dale Chihuly and his team have spread 20 different installations throughout the garden\u2019s 250 acres. Visitors who head to the Bronx will find a 30-foot-tall \u201cScarlet and Yellow Icicle Tower\u201d and the spiky blue supernova \u201cSapphire Star.\u201d Tucked away in the grand old Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, 14 bright red and lily-pad-shaped \u201cPersians\u201d and 18 slender \u201cBlue Herons\u201d emerge from a pond, alongside lush green plants. Mr. Chihuly\u2019s exhibition here in 2006 attracted some 360,000 people, the largest crowd in the Garden\u2019s history then. But his showmanship has also attracted a certain ambivalence, from both the art world \u2014 the website Artinfo ran an article in 2012 called \u201cTop 10 Favorite Mean Things That Have Been Said About Dale Chihuly\u201d \u2014 as well as from garden visitors. When it opened last weekend, however, many viewers said they came to the garden specifically to see the Chihuly works. \u201cWe have gardens in Indianapolis, too,\u201d said Sarah Wasson, who was visiting New York. \u201cBut the way he juxtaposes glass, which is hard, with plants that are soft \u2014 that\u2019s what I like.\u201d Others felt the glass pieces were superfluous, \u201clike seeing remnants of a nice meal on a table,\u201d said Altan Kolsal, a city planner who lives in Manhattan. \u201cI\u2019m looking past them. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re there. But I\u2019m here for my nature walk.\u201d The mild-mannered and curly-haired Mr. Chihuly, 75, certainly doesn\u2019t seem like a lightning rod. He came to town for the opening of the show with his wife of 25 years, Leslie Jackson Chihuly, who\u2019s the president and chief executive of Chihuly Studios. Sometimes adjusting his eye patch \u2014 his left eye was blinded in a 1976 car crash \u2014 the artist noted that he had never taken to actual gardening himself. Rather, his work on the \u201cGarden Series\u201d was influenced by his mother\u2019s green thumb. \u201cShe loved that garden, and she was out there every day,\u201d he said, recalling her azaleas and rhododendrons in Tacoma, Wash., where he grew up. Mr. Chihuly was jet-lagged from a trip to Venice, where, as a young man, he once studied glassmaking for eight months. He said his love of his signature material remained undimmed from his student days. He started by weaving glass into tapestries but, eventually, the weaving part, once his primary technique, fell away. \u201cThere is something about glass, one of the few materials that light goes through,\u201d Mr. Chihuly said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at light itself.\u201d The shapes that Mr. Chihuly has spread to institutions worldwide remind many people of organic forms. But he has always maintained that copying nature has never been his goal. \u201cI\u2019m not conscious of mimicking,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t study plant books. Glass wants to make forms like that, if you let it.\u201d Chihuly Studios now makes some 30 commissioned works a year \u2014 a red-and-gold-leaf chandelier sold for $50,000 at auction last year \u2014 and his website sells handmade editions of pieces for between $5,000 and $8,500. In addition, the studio mounts special exhibitions, like his \u201cGarden Series.\u201d Edward Cooke, a professor of American decorative arts at Yale, compared him to another prolific glassmaker who found a way to master both the high culture of museums as well as the popular market. \u201cYou could say he\u2019s the contemporary version of Louis Comfort Tiffany,\u201d said Mr. Cooke, who is very familiar with the work of both artists. Like many people in the art world, Mr. Cooke, though, is of two minds about Mr. Chihuly. He admires some work, but noted, \u201cThere\u2019s a crassness to it at times,\u201d which he attributed to \u201ccolor, sensory overload, scale and ubiquity.\u201d However he derives his forms, \u201chaving artwork in the landscape changed how people view the plants, and the entire garden,\u201d said Karen Daubmann, associate vice president for exhibitions and public engagement at the New York Botanical Garden, referring to the 2006 show. \u201cPeople thought of us as an exhibition venue from that point on.\u201d (The Botanical Garden had 525,000 visitors to \u201cFrida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life,\u201d in 2015.) And Ms. Daubmann had a ready response for any purists who think that Mr. Chihuly is merely gilding lilies. \u201cThere are people who are not fans, but our answer to that is that this is a temporary display,\u201d she said. \u201cWe say, \u2018Come check it out,\u2019 but it will be gone by November, and it\u2019s back to your favorite flowers and shrubs.\u201d Mr. Chihuly, who has three studios and a staff of 80, long ago gave up blowing glass himself. His current role, he said, was simple: \u201cI tell the team what I want to have made, and I select from there what I want to use.\u201d But he emphasized that he was still involved in developing techniques in his art. \u201cI\u2019m now doing these enamel paintings on glass,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fire it at 1,200 degrees.\u201d Though Mr. Chihuly didn\u2019t say so, framing himself as an experimenting pioneer may have been on his mind when he decided to add more austere versions of his early work to \u201cCHIHULY.\u201d Back in the \u201970s, he placed blown-glass panels in a rocky landscape, and some along a river, in ways that call to mind the Land Art movement of that era. The colored panes of polycarbonate that form the \u201cKoda\u201d works in the current show lean up against one another in a pool of water and, in another installation, hang together in a large grid over a pond. Glenn Adamson, a former director of the Museum of Arts and Design in Manhattan, said he recognized Mr. Chihuly as a leader of the glass movement and, recently, as someone who has a real genius \u201cas an inventor of forms.\u201d He added that, to his mind, a garden was better than a museum as a setting for Mr. Chihuly\u2019s pieces: \u201cI would say his work is at its best in a natural environment. It competes very well with plants.\u201d Over lunch \u2014 Mr. Chihuly ordered a bunless hamburger and ate half of it \u2014 his wife said that he had a naturally positive attitude. \u201cDale gets up every morning and goes to the studio to make work,\u201d Ms. Chihuly said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to fold up like an old lawn chair just because someone didn\u2019t like his work.\u201d She added \u2014 perhaps slyly, given his success \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s been getting just enough encouragement to keep him going.\u201d Of some criticism, Mr. Chihuly said, \u201cIt bothers you for a while, and then you forget about it.\u201d But his one blue eye did twinkle a bit when he made a comparison to another era when many makers competed for favor in a crowded landscape of potential patrons. \u201cI wonder how that worked in the Renaissance,\u201d Mr. Chihuly said, musing on what the ambitious denizens of the 15th-century art world said about one another. He paused. \u201cI wonder if they were as critical as the ones now?\u201d", "title": "Are There Glass Snakes in Dale Chihuly\u2019s Fragile Eden?", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T17:04:09-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/design/are-there-glass-snakes-in-dale-chihulys-fragile-eden.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00"}
