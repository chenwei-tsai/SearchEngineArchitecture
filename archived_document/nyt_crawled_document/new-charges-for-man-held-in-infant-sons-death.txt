The new indictment, which was filed on Friday, charges Justin Ross Harris with two counts of sexual exploitation of children and six counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors. Mr. Harris already faces multiple charges, including murder, in the June 2014 death of his 22-month-old son Cooper. His trial on those charges is set to begin April 11. \u201cWe are concerned that the timing of this indictment is a calculated maneuver to inflame public opinion against Ross on the eve of jury selection,\u201d Mr. Harris\u2019s lawyer, Maddox Kilgore, said in an emailed statement. \u201cIt is clear that these allegations are wholly unrelated to the accidental death of Cooper Harris.\u201d The state has investigated every aspect of Mr. Harris\u2019s life for nearly two years, and makes no new allegations of cruelty, abuse or neglect in the new indictment, Mr. Kilgore said. \u201cThe content and timing of this indictment confirms the absence of such evidence, and it signals the state\u2019s desperation to convict Ross of the worst mistake any of us as parents could make,\u201d he said. The Cobb County district attorney, Vic Reynolds, said in an emailed statement that the new charges stemmed from advances in electronic forensic analysis and newly discovered victims. If the state had waited any longer to file the new charges, some would have been barred by the statute of limitations, he said. The indictment names three underage girls and says Mr. Harris had lewd photos of two of them, sent nude photos to two of them, and gave two of them printed material containing \u201cexplicit and detailed verbal descriptions and narrative accounts of sexual excitement and sexual conduct.\u201d Mr. Harris was previously indicted in September 2014 on charges including malice murder, felony murder and cruelty to children. That indictment also includes charges related to accusations that Mr. Harris tried to get an underage girl to send him a photo of her genitalia, had sexually explicit online conversations with her, and sent her a sexually explicit photo. The police have said that Cooper Harris was left in an S.U.V. for about seven hours on a day when the Atlanta area temperature reached at least the high 80s. The medical examiner\u2019s office has said the boy died of hyperthermia \u2014 essentially overheating \u2014 and called his death a homicide. Mr. Harris has been in jail without bond since the day his son died. His lawyers have said the boy\u2019s death was an accident.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T05:00:10-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/us/new-charges-for-man-held-in-infant-sons-death.html", "item_type": "Article"}
