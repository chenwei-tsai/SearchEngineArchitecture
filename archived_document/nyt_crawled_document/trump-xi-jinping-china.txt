{"text": "BEIJING \u2014 President Trump came into office fuming about China. But lately he has been describing his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, as if Mr. Xi were an old friend, even in dealing with deep divisions over North Korea. \u201cI believe he is trying very hard,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. \u201cHe is a good man. He is a very good man, and I got to know him very well.\u201d That\u2019s heady praise for someone the president had never met before this month. But Mr. Trump\u2019s time as a businessman may help make sense of his backslapping tributes to Mr. Xi. In \u201cTrump: The Art of the Deal,\u201d his braggadocious memoir-cum-business playbook from 1987, Mr. Trump explained how he flattered, pummeled, cajoled and bluffed his way to what he wanted. He seems to hope to use the same tactics with China. \u201cA little hyperbole never hurts,\u201d he wrote of his deal-making. Before the recent courtship, Mr. Trump had little good to say about China or Mr. Xi. In March 2016, Mr. Trump was asked in an interview with The New York Times about his impressions of Mr. Xi. Instead, he vented about China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States. \u201cNobody has manipulated economic conditions better than they have,\u201d he said. After Mr. Trump won the election, he kept taking potshots at the Chinese leadership. In December, Mr. Trump had a friendly phone chat with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, alarming Chinese officials, who regard Taiwan as a breakaway province. Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi had a brief phone call days after the American election, but more than two months passed before they had their next call \u2014 their first since the president took office. Mr. Trump said he would honor the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, under which the United States does not give diplomatic recognition to Taiwan. But even as that issue faded as a source of tension with China, Mr. Trump has appeared increasingly alarmed about North Korea. After the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, said on Jan. 1 that his government was preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, Mr. Trump complained that China had not put enough pressure on its ally and neighbor. \u201cChina has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won\u2019t help with North Korea. Nice!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter. The signs before his first meeting with Mr. Xi were not promising. Days before they met at Mr. Trump\u2019s resort in Florida, the president warned that China had to play along on North Korea or get out of the way. \u201cChina has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Financial Times. \u201cIf they do, that will be very good for China, and if they don\u2019t, it won\u2019t be good for anyone.\u201d But Mr. Trump\u2019s potentially frosty first encounter with Mr. Xi turned out to be fairly amicable, and has been followed by two phone calls to discuss North Korea. They didn\u2019t see eye to eye on many things, but at least they were talking, and Mr. Trump was effusive about his new friend. Mr. Trump told Fox Business Network that he had a \u201cvery, very good meeting with President Xi of China.\u201d Mr. Trump invoked Mr. Xi again on Saturday, when he condemned North Korea\u2019s latest, failed missile test. \u201cNorth Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter. \u201cI really liked him,\u201d Mr. Trump said of their talks in Florida. \u201cWe had a great chemistry, I think. I mean at least I had a great chemistry \u2014 maybe he didn\u2019t like me, but I think he liked me.\u201d Mr. Xi isn\u2019t the only Asian leader caught in something of a whipsaw courtship with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has boasted about his new friendship with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, another country that was the target of his campaign warnings. \u201cWe have a very, very good bond \u2014 very, very good chemistry,\u201d Mr. Trump said after meeting Mr. Abe in February. Mr. Trump even appears willing to sprinkle a little flattery on Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, who has accelerated his government\u2019s drive for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. \u201cHe\u2019s 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want, but that is not easy, especially at that age,\u201d he said in the Reuters interview of Mr. Kim, who is part of a dynastic succession. \u201cI\u2019m not giving him credit or not giving him credit, I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s a very hard thing to do.\u201d The initial rush of good will between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi might not last. China and the United States disagree on how harshly to pressure North Korea, and that rift could widen if North Korea stages another nuclear test. In the same Reuters interview, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea.\u201d Not the kind of soothing talk that Mr. Xi says is needed to coax North Korea into concessions. Washington and Beijing also have stubborn disagreements over trade and China\u2019s sweeping claims over the South China Sea. The United States is installing an antimissile system in South Korea that China sees as a threat to its own missile defenses. As Mr. Trump wrote in \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d words can carry a cause only so far. \u201cYou can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/world/asia/trump-xi-jinping-china.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T18:34:34-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T18:34:34-04:00", "abstract": "President Trump came into office fuming about China.
