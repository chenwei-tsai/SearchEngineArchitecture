{"text": "Ryan Seacrest, the master Hollywood multitasker, was named Kelly Ripa\u2019s \u201cLive\u201d co-host on Monday, giving him a high-profile platform and bringing stability to an important ABC morning show as it prepares for new competition. \u201cIt\u2019s making sure the show is in the right hands \u2014 one day, eventually, I\u2019m sure of it, I will retire,\u201d Ms. Ripa, 46, who has been a \u201cLive\u201d host since 2001, said by phone. \u201cAnd Ryan Seacrest, who is a seamless broadcaster and a kind human being, is the one who can take this show into the future.\u201d Mr. Seacrest, speaking on a separate call, heaped similar praise on Ms. Ripa. \u201cShe is so smooth and seamless and wonderfully clever and quick \u2014 she\u2019s part of people\u2019s lives, in their living rooms \u2014 and I want to come in as a friend of hers and as a friend to the audience,\u201d he said. The honeymoon period may be short. Starting in the fall, NBC is expected to make a renewed push for ratings supremacy in the 9 a.m. Eastern time slot that Ms. Ripa and her various wingmen have long dominated. In what promises to be one of the most intriguing battles of television, NBC will either schedule Megyn Kelly\u2019s new daytime talk show against Ms. Ripa and Mr. Seacrest \u2014 cue the Kelly-versus-Kelly tabloid headlines \u2014 or move the popular Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb block of the \u201cToday\u201d show into direct competition with \u201cLive.\u201d Each outcome sets up a marquee battle. Ms. Gifford was Ms. Ripa\u2019s \u201cLive\u201d predecessor. Ms. Kelly joined NBC in January after a successful ratings run at Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s always interesting to me when people try to pit us against other shows,\u201d Ms. Ripa said, brushing aside a question about increased competition. \u201cWe don\u2019t compare ourselves to anybody because we are the only ones who do what we do.\u201d Mr. Seacrest, 42, joins Ms. Ripa one year after her previous \u201cLive\u201d co-host, Michael Strahan, abruptly left for a job at \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on ABC. It was a badly bungled transition: Ms. Ripa felt blindsided by Mr. Strahan\u2019s negotiations with ABC, which were kept secret until the last minute, and she saw ABC as slighting her show in favor of another. She did not come to work for three days while ABC did damage control. But Ms. Ripa, who recently signed a new multiyear contract, said she had moved on from that drama. \u201cWhatever brought us to here was worth it 1,000 times over,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a great, great moment.\u201d \u201cLive,\u201d with its celebrity chitchat, home viewer trivia segment and occasional burst of confetti, has been a brightly lit national television institution since 1988, when Regis Philbin and Ms. Gifford held the coffee mugs. Little about the bouncy show will change with Mr. Seacrest\u2019s arrival, at least at first. \u201cLive,\u201d after all, still wins its time period, attracting an average of 3.2 million viewers, according to Nielsen. \u201cWe welcome Ryan\u2019s energy, enthusiasm and entrepreneurial spirit and look forward to all the possibilities that the future holds,\u201d Ben Sherwood, president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, said in a statement. \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan,\u201d as the syndicated series will now be called, represents an important career moment for Mr. Seacrest. The program returns him to regular broadcast television a year after the end of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which he hosted on Fox for 15 seasons. A successful run on \u201cLive\u201d could give a boost to Mr. Seacrest\u2019s personal businesses, which include a clothing line, Ryan Seacrest Distinction, and a coming skin care line. (The show also brings him another rich payday. Terms of his multiyear contract were not disclosed, but it is easily worth millions of dollars annually.) For ABC, which has pursued Mr. Seacrest for years, landing him required a herculean behind-the-scenes effort to rearrange his Rubik\u2019s Cube of a schedule. Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, was even involved, Mr. Seacrest said. Consider, for instance, Mr. Seacrest\u2019s Los Angeles radio show, \u201cOn Air With Ryan Seacrest,\u201d which iHeartRadio broadcasts on weekday mornings from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Pacific time. It will continue in its present form. But he will now work from a New York recording studio instead of a California one, at least for most of the year, and some segments during the radio program\u2019s first hour \u2014 since it will overlap with \u201cLive\u201d \u2014 will be taped. \u201cVery few people have both the appeal and the work ethic to accomplish this,\u201d Robert W. Pittman, chief executive of iHeartMedia, said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to see him return to another regular TV platform.\u201d Mr. Seacrest\u2019s \u201cAmerican Top 40,\u201d a nationally syndicated weekend radio show, will continue. So will his hosting duties for iHeart events and his affiliation with NBCUniversal\u2019s E channel. Mr. Seacrest hosts red-carpet specials for E, and his Los Angeles-based production company supplies the network with reality shows like \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d Among his other commitments: hosting \u201cDick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve With Ryan Seacrest\u201d for ABC, maintaining endorsement deals with Coca-Cola and Ford, and various philanthropic and nonprofit pursuits. \u201cThe puzzle of it all is what took a long time to figure out,\u201d Mr. Seacrest said of the negotiations with ABC. \u201cI love to do a lot, but I am very conscious of making sure that no commitment is less favorite than another. They all deserve full focus, full attention, full energy.\u201d In many ways, Mr. Seacrest and Ms. Ripa are mirror images. They have a peppy polish, teacup physiques and an ability \u2014 harder than it looks \u2014 to engage celebrities in entertaining conversation. They first got to know each other more than a decade ago at Walt Disney World in Florida, where they hosted a Christmas parade telecast. Who would land the \u201cLive\u201d hosting job had been a topic of hot speculation for the celebrity news media over the last year. Anderson Cooper? Mario Lopez? For Ms. Ripa, who had approval over who would sit beside her on \u201cLive,\u201d Mr. Seacrest got the job the day in November when he appeared on the show as her guest co-host and did an awkward cooking segment with his mother, Connie. (They made oyster casserole.) \u201cIt\u2019s like he didn\u2019t even know what a kitchen is,\u201d Ms. Ripa said. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018Did we finally find a flaw in this person?
