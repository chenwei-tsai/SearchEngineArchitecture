{"text": "A dank night, a head-over-heels flip into the stands and a high-wire act from Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman could not put a damper on Aaron Judge\u2019s 25th birthday. Judge made his first trip into the Fenway Park caldron on Wednesday a memorable one on Wednesday night, hitting the first pitch he saw \u2014 from the reigning Cy Young Award winner Rick Porcello \u2014 for a home run, then following that up by tumbling over a wall to make a highlight-reel catch. Judge\u2019s efforts backed the sterling pitching of Luis Severino, who shut out the Red Sox on three hits over seven innings in a 3-1 victory in the first meeting of the season between the teams. With a three-run cushion entering the ninth, Chapman walked leadoff hitter Andrew Benintendi, then gave up a double to Mookie Betts and a run-scoring groundout to Chris Young. Chapman then threw a wild pitch that moved Betts to third and walked Hanley Ramirez, who hit a game-ending home run last September against the Yankees \u2014 a moment that seemed to turn the fortunes of both teams. After Chapman recovered to strike out Jackie Bradley Jr., Josh Rutledge \u2014 on the seventh pitch of the at-bat \u2014 hit a towering drive down the left-field line, reminiscent of Carlton Fisk\u2019s memorable home run in the 1975 World Series. But this one hooked just foul. Chapman ended the drama by striking Rutledge out on the next pitch. If this rich rivalry is entering a new phase after the retirements of David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez, two sluggers who took their outsize personalities with them, the Yankees and the Red Sox have plenty of candidates ready to step into central roles. It was Judge\u2019s turn on Wednesday. A 6-foot-7, 275-pound right fielder, Judge is quickly turning last season\u2019s sketchy cameo, when he struck out in half his at-bats, into a distant memory. Judge has now hit seven home runs and leads the Yankees with 15 R.B.I., and his .672 slugging percentage is second in the American League to Mike Trout. Judge has made his mark with prodigious power, blasting a 459-foot home run on Saturday in Pittsburgh \u2013 one of three home runs this season that have exceeded 435 feet. But in the second inning, after Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts threw away Starlin Castro\u2019s grounder, Judge showed that he is more than just a swing-from-the-heels brute who might be seduced by the lure of hitting a ball over the Green Monster. Instead, Judge took a fastball that was low and away and drove it toward right field and into the Yankees\u2019 bullpen. An inning later, Judge made an even more eye-catching play. Bogaerts lifted a fly ball down the right-field line, and Judge came barreling toward the low wall that hugs the line. Judge slowed only at the last instant, reaching over the wall to catch the ball and then tumbling into the stands. The row that Judge plunged into was vacant \u2014 a fortunate byproduct of the miserable conditions. Judge, on his back, flipped the ball to Castro as Boston\u2019s Marco Hernandez tagged up and advanced to third. The first-base umpire Mark Carlson initially ruled that Judge had not caught the ball, but the Yankees challenged the call and a replay review confirmed that Judge had indeed made the catch. For many young players like Judge, the first trip to Fenway Park can be jarring. Contemporary stadiums, even the ones that are nostalgically modeled after old ballparks, are built far higher, with the upper decks usually stacked upon a layer of suites. Fenway, with its fabled left-field wall, is intimate, like stepping back in time. \u201cEverything is closer here,\u201d said Greg Bird, who played his first game at Fenway Park late in the 2015 season and compared the ballpark to the aging ones in the Class A South Atlantic League. \u201cThe newer stadiums are big and open. People get on you here, good and bad. You can feel it. It\u2019s something unique.\u201d Judge had been to Fenway Park once before \u2014 as a college sophomore during the summer of 2012 when he briefly worked out there with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod League. \u201cWe were in such a rush,\u201d Judge said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t take a pitch in batting practice; we were swinging at everything. But I enjoyed every minute of it.\u201d He had no trouble enjoying his first game here. He also played a part in pushing across the Yankees\u2019 final run in the sixth, when he drew a two-out walk from Porcello after falling behind no balls and two strikes. Judge advanced to second on a wild pitch and hustled home on Greg Bird\u2019s line single. The hit was an especially welcome one for Bird, who had one hit in his previous 21 at-bats and was 5 for 50 on the season. It was all that Severino needed. He allowed three hits over seven innings, walking two and striking out six. He was bothered only twice. After Judge\u2019s catch, he retired Benintendi on a liner to left to strand Hernandez at third base. In the fourth, there was trouble when Betts led off with a dribbler down the third-base line and Mitch Moreland walked. But Ramirez hit a hard grounder up the middle, right at Castro, who was standing on second base. He easily completed the double play, and Severino retired Bradley on a fly ball to end the inning. Castro also made a terrific defensive play to end the seventh, deftly scooping shortstop Ronald Torreyes\u2019s short hop throw from the hole to gain a force out. The Yankees then turned the game over to Dellin Betances, who pitched a flawless eighth, and Chapman, who was far from perfect in the ninth.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/sports/baseball/new-york-yankees-boston-red-sox-score-3-1.html", "published_date": "2017-04-25T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T22:51:34-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-26T22:51:34-04:00", "abstract": "In his first trip to Fenway Park, Judge hit the first pitch he saw for a homer and tumbled into the stands for a highlight-reel catch.", "title": "Aaron Judge Powers Yankees Over Red Sox"}
