We don\u2019t use recipes,\u201d de Boer says. \u201cWe just cook what we fancy for dinner that night.\u201d Lately, that\u2019s been everything from whipped salt cod with grilled polenta to rose veal with artichokes, which the duo \u2014 who are alums of the River Caf\u00e9 in London \u2014 creates using fresh, seasonal ingredients sourced from farmers\u2019 markets and local purveyors. Though the menu changes daily, there has been one mainstay since the bistro debuted last fall: panisse, a crispy Proven\u00e7al snack made with chickpea flour. \u201cWe like to have a cold drink and a few fingers of panisse ourselves so it\u2019s one of the things that sticks to the menu,\u201d de Boer says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been open for seven months now, and we still enjoy it.\u201d Last night, the savory bite was served alongside the four-course meal they prepared for the Edible Schoolyard NYC Spring Benefit. It was the first time the chefs represented King at the annual charity dinner, and the two felt inspired by the nonprofit\u2019s mission of culinary youth education. \u201cI come from a very food-learned family,\u201d says de Boer, who grew up in England, India and the Middle East. \u201cThe only thing that was consistent in my childhood was that we gathered around the dinner table every single night and shared a lot of wonderful food.\u201d Shadbolt\u2019s earliest food memories revolve around cooking with her mother in Essex, England: \u201cA Saturday would never go by without us making jam or bread or chutneys,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d pull up a stool and just help her; from an early age, it\u2019s been about cooking with her.\u201d Both de Boer and Shadbolt traveled frequently as kids, which helped shape the concept for King. \u201cWe spent a lot of summers in Italy and the South of France, so that\u2019s where the inspiration comes from,\u201d de Boer says. Pissaladi\u00e8re, a classic tart, was often packed in a picnic basket (and now occasionally appears on the menu at King). \u201cIts very much what I used to eat on the beach,\u201d Shadbolt says. \u201cThe saltiness of the sea and the thyme would be behind you in the hills. I can almost feel the sand beneath my toes when I eat something like this.\u201d Here, the chefs share the nostalgic recipe, which they recommend serving with a simple salad and glass of ros\u00e9. 7 ounces cold, unsalted butter, cut into cubes2 \u2153 cups flour\u00bd teaspoon fine salt pinch of granulated sugar Ice water6 large red onions Maldon sea saltCracked black pepper20 anchovy fillets (we use salted Ortiz, which we rinse and fillet) 1 cup black ni\u00e7oise olives 1 bunch fresh thyme Olive oil 1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. 2. Start by making the dough: Using a food processor, bring together the butter, flour, salt and sugar until it resembles a fine bread crumb. Slowly add the ice water, a little at a time, until the dough barely comes together. 3. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill for two to three hours before using. (This can be made a couple of days in advance and will keep in the fridge.) 4. To make the topping, peel and cut the onions in half. Slice thinly. In a large, wide, heavy-bottomed saucepan, gently sweat the onions in a little olive oil, Maldon sea salt and cracked black pepper, covered with a cartouche. When the onions are soft, remove the cartouche to evaporate the excess liquid. Do not allow the onions to color \u2014 they should be soft and intensely sweet but not caramelized. This should take an hour. Remove from the pan and leave to cool. 5. Using a box grater, grate the pastry onto a lined 11-by-17-inch baking sheet. Grating breaks up the gluten strands, which gives you a much thinner crust. Then press the dough into the base to form a thin layer along the bottom of the tray. Cover again and chill for a further 30 minutes. 6. Remove the tray from the fridge and prick the base a couple of times with a fork. Bake in the oven for 40 minutes until crisp but not browned. 7. Remove the crust from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Top with the onions and smooth out to form a thin layer. Lattice the anchovies across the top of the onions and place an olive in each square. Sprinkle with thyme, black pepper and olive oil and bake in the oven for a further 20 minutes. 7. Pack in your picnic basket, along with fresh greens for a salad and a bottle of Domaine Tempier ros\u00e9.
