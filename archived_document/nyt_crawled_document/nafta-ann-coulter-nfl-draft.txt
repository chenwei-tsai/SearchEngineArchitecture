{"text": "Good morning. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Trump\u2019s tax plan and you. We look at the seven most important changes in President Trump\u2019s tax proposal, which our White House reporters describe as less of a plan than a wish list. It would sharply reduce income tax rates for individuals and businesses, but how it would be financed is unclear, and deficit hawks are worried. We break down what the plan would cost, and our chief economics correspondent looks at who wins \u2014 including the president himself \u2014 and who loses. \u2022 New life for a G.O.P. health bill. The House Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-line conservatives who were instrumental in blocking President Trump\u2019s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act last month, approved a  more conservative revision on Wednesday.

But conservatives are eagerly putting themselves into volatile situations on campuses, inspired by a backlash against political correctness. \u2022 A hidden killer lurks. Once a dumping ground for garbage, the New Jersey Meadowlands have become something of a natural treasure, attracting 280 species of birds.

The move would overturn rules passed two years ago to protect so-called net neutrality. \u2022 United Airlines will offer up to $10,000 in travel certificates to passengers who volunteer to change flights, one of several steps the airline announced today as it responds to a series of public relations fiascos. On Wednesday, it contended with the death of a giant rabbit on one of its flights. \u2022 ESPN, which is struggling as more people cut the cable cord, laid off scores of employees, including some prominent on-air personalities. \u2022 U.S. stocks were down on Wednesday.

On \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Trevor Noah tackled Confederate Memorial Day: \u201cWhat are black people are supposed to do on this holiday?\u201d Pope Francis will visit Egypt on Friday, the second trip by a modern pope to the biblical land, after John Paul II\u2019s in 2000. Francis is expected to meet with another pope, one who is little known outside the country: Tawadros II of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Copts consider Tawadros II their 118th pope; the apostle Mark is said to have established the church in Alexandria, in northern Egypt, in the first century. The two churches parted ways in a dispute about the nature of Christ in the fifth century. It wasn\u2019t until 1973 that a Coptic pope visited the Vatican. Unlike his Roman Catholic counterpart, who is chosen by cardinals, the Coptic pope is selected by a lottery that is said to incorporate the hand of God. When Tawadros II\u2019s predecessor, Shenouda III, died in 2012, an electoral college of clergy and laymen selected a shortlist of three candidates. Crystal balls sealed with wax containing the candidates\u2019 names were then taken to St. Mark\u2019s Cathedral in Cairo. There, a blindfolded 6-year-old boy in a white robe picked Tawadros\u2019s name from a glass bowl.
