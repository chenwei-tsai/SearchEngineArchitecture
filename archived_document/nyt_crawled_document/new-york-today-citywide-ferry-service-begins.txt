{"text": "Good morning on this misty Monday. Today, you have a new way to get around the city: by water. NYC Ferry opens this morning. The service, with six lines, will eventually link Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx along the East River. Ferries on two of those lines \u2014 the Rockaway, Queens, route and the existing East River route \u2014 are up and running, with the South Brooklyn and Astoria routes expected to follow in August, and the Lower East Side and the Bronx routes in the summer of 2018. A one-way trip will cost $2.75, the same as a subway ride. For $1 more, you can bring your bicycle onboard. (You can also purchase a 30-day pass.) All routes have battery-charging stations and concession stands, and Wi-Fi is on its way, too. The Rockaway route: \u2022 This ferry will make three stops:  Rockaway,  Sunset Park and  Wall Street/Pier 11. \u2022 On weekday mornings, the earliest boat will depart Rockaway at 5:30 a.m. and Sunset Park at 6:15 to arrive at the Wall Street pier by 6:28. \u2022 Commuting the other way? The earliest boat will depart Wall Street at 6:30 a.m. and Sunset Park at 6:45 to arrive in Rockaway by 7:27. \u2022 Traveling on the weekend? You can see that schedule here. The current East River route: \u2022 The ferry will still make stops at East 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan; Hunters Point South, Greenpoint, North and South Williamsburg and Dumbo in Brooklyn; Governors Island; and Wall Street/Pier 11 in Lower Manhattan. So what\u2019s new? There will be an additional vessel, which means more frequent service. \u2022 You can see the schedule here.
