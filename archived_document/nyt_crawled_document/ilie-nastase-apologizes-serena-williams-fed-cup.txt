{"text": "BUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 Ilie Nastase responded to the backlash from his comments about Serena Williams and his Fed Cup outburst, saying in a Facebook post on Friday that his remarks about the pregnant tennis great were \u201cspontaneous\u201d and his tirade inexcusable. At a Fed Cup news conference last week, Nastase, the Romanian team captain, speculated about the skin color of the baby Williams is expecting, saying to a team member: \u201cLet\u2019s see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?\u201d Williams is black and her fianc\u00e9, Alexis Ohanian, is white. Nastase said on Friday that when he was asked at the news conference for his opinion about Williams\u2019s pregnancy, it was the first time he heard she was pregnant. \u201cMy reaction was spontaneous,\u201d he said. He added that Williams was \u201cone of the greatest players of all times, and I know how much work goes into achieving these results.\u201d Nastase was also criticized for swearing at the British player Johanna Konta and captain Anne Keothavong during a Fed Cup match on Saturday. He said he would not try to \u201cdefend my words, but I assure you that behind them was my desire to defend the interests of the Romanian team and Romanian tennis.\u201d Romania won the best-of-five series, 3-2, but Nastase was barred by the International Tennis Federation. Nastase called tennis not a sport but \u201cmy life,\u201d saying his outburst meant \u201cI managed to do what I didn\u2019t imagine was possible, to feel that tennis was slipping away from me.\u201d \u201cI know that nothing can really excuse my words, nor a high-level match, not the nonconformist attitude I am now known for, not the unfortunate amplification of the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life remains dedicated to tennis and its public and I ask you to accept, as much as is possible, my apologies.\u201d Despite the apology, he took another shot at Konta. \u201cI think what happened was exaggerated from all sides,\u201d Nastase said. \u201cNonetheless, Johanna Konta should not have spoken with the chair umpire, that\u2019s what the team captain does. I asked her in a civilized way for some explanations, and she sent me to the tribune where I was removed as captain. After this, the umpire suspended the match. I don\u2019t know why the match was suspended.\u201d Nastase earned the nickname \u201cNasty\u201d for his on-court outbursts and gamesmanship in his playing heyday in the 1970s. But it also described his game, which earned him two Grand Slam singles titles and more than 100 ATP titles. He is a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/sports/tennis/ilie-nastase-apologizes-serena-williams-fed-cup.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T16:41:24-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T16:41:24-04:00", "abstract": "Ilie Nastase said in a Facebook post on Friday that his remarks about the pregnant tennis great were \u201cspontaneous.\u201d", "title": "Nastase Calls His Comments on Serena Williams Inexcusable and Apologizes"}
