Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 North Korea\u2019s decision to hold only artillery drills for national celebrations, not a nuclear test, did not end fears of a military confrontation. The U.S. strengthened its show of force, adding a submarine armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles to the naval exercises it\u2019s conducting with South Korea. With fears that the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal could grow to 50 weapons within a few years, and with the country holding three U.S. citizens, the full U.S. Senate is being briefed today at the White House, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plans to lead a special meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday, and China sent a Korea-focused diplomat to Tokyo. _____ \u2022 \u201cWe pledge \u2014 never again. We must never shrink away about telling the truth about evil in our time.\u201d President Trump made a forceful speech at the annual Holocaust remembrance ceremony in Washington, apparently seeking to end to criticism that he has played down the suffering of Jews. Earlier, Mr. Trump backed off his demand for immediate funds to build a wall along the Mexican border, easing the path of a spending bill to keep the government running past Friday. Meanwhile, his call for a sharp cut to business taxes sent U.S. stocks soaring. The Nasdaq rose above 6,000 for the first time. _____ \u2022 China\u2019s embrace of live streaming has transformed entertainment, dating and dining. But now thousands of schools across the country are installing webcams in classrooms, with streams open to shaming comments from the public. \u201cI hate it,\u201d a high school senior said. \u201cI feel like we are zoo animals.\u201d _____ \u2022 Repel them? Shoot them? Catch and kill? A shark attack that killed a 17-year-old surfer last week inflamed Australia\u2019s debate over what, if anything, should be done to make offshore adventuring safer. Culling could damage populations of endangered shark species, and some say open water is simply inherently risky. _____ \u2022  In Indonesia, a palm oil company responsible for rain-forest destruction helped purchase part of an island in Borneo for an orangutan sanctuary. That enabled at least 200 animals \u2014 all refugees of development \u2014 to be freed. But it also left environmentalists queasy about providing a cloak of respectability to a company that destroys orangutan habitats. \u2022 Facebook is contending with some of the unintended consequences of hyperconnectivity \u2014 fake news, misinformation, echo chambers. Our technology reporter met with Mark Zuckerberg to find out if the most powerful tool for connection in human history is capable of adapting to the world it created. \u2022 India\u2019s bar owners are finding creative ways to skirt a new law that bans the sale of alcohol within 500 meters of state and national highways \u2014 like building indoor mazes. \u2022 Nearly half of the largest U.S. corporations have set their own emissions reduction targets, even as the Trump administration retreats from environmental priorities. The laggards, a study finds, are energy companies. \u2022 U.S. stocks were strong. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Phan Phan-Gillis, an American businesswoman, was sentenced in Beijing to three and a half years in prison on spying charges her husband has adamantly refuted, but she may be expelled from China before having to serve her sentence. [The New York Times] \u2022 Ivanka Trump drew groans and hisses from an audience in Germany for defending her father\u2019s treatment of women and calling him a \u201ctremendous champion of supporting families.\u201d [The New York Times] \u2022 A television host in Australia courted controversy for a Twitter post on Anzac Day that suggested attention be paid not only to World War I dead, but to the suffering the country has inflicted on refugees. [The Sydney Morning Herald] \u2022 The Chinese government, seeking to \u201ccurb religious fervor\u201d in western China, has prohibited parents from choosing names like \u201cMuhammad,\u201d \u201cArafat\u201d and \u201cJihad\u201d for their children. [The New York Times] \u2022 Japan\u2019s reconstruction minister plans to resign after a gaffe involving inappropriate remarks about the country\u2019s 2011 earthquake and tsunami. [Bloomberg] \u2022 An 11-month-old girl was murdered in Thailand by her father, who broadcast the crime live on Facebook before killing himself. [The New York Times] \u2022 The hackers who targeted Democratic campaign officials ahead of last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election appear to be targeting Emmanuel Macron, the leading French presidential candidate. [The New York Times] \u2022 Jakarta\u2019s outgoing governor, known as Ahok, ended his defense on blasphemy charges with a reference to a children\u2019s movie, saying: \u201cI am just a little fish named Nemo trying to save a school of fish named Jakarta.\u201d [The Australian] \u2022  One of the most crucial keys to being successful at work: taking time off. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Eggs, chorizo and asparagus would do well at any time of day. \u2022 In Rwanda, \u201creconciliation villages\u201d place homes for victims of the 1994 genocide alongside those convicted of carrying out the violence. But it can be difficult to gauge their success. \u2022 \u201cRobbery of the century\u201d? Dozens of heavily armed assailants in Paraguay made off with an estimated $40 million from the vault of an armored car company. \u2022 A new online project recreates the sights and sounds of New York City from 400 years ago, long before the chorus of croaking frogs was replaced with the grumble of cars and trucks. Last weekend, protesters in the U.S. marched in defense of scientific inquiry, spurred by a president who casts doubt on climate change. There was a time, however, when a government would call on a citizen-scientist to find answers. On this day in 1803, a shower of 2,000 to 3,000 meteorites fell upon L\u2019Aigle, France. The French Academy of Sciences sent Jean-Baptiste Biot, a physicist, to assess the origin of the debris. Biot found that the meteorites did not resemble anything on Earth and, considering accounts of \u201ca rain of stones thrown by the meteor,\u201d confirmed they must be from outer space. He thus established the field of study called meteoritics. (Meteorology, the study of the atmosphere and its phenomena, was already claimed.) Biot\u2019s findings didn\u2019t convince everyone, however. Four years later, a meteor and its debris were seen in Connecticut. Two scientists from Yale concluded that they came from outer space. However, the American president at the time, Thomas Jefferson, greeted the news with caution. (Although a quote that has been widely attributed to him is likely apocryphal: It\u2019s \u201ceasier to believe that two Yankee professors could lie than to admit that stones could fall from heaven.\u201d) It wasn\u2019t until later in the 19th century that meteorites\u2019 extraterrestrial origins became widely accepted as scientific fact.
