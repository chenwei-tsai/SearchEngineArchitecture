{"text": "The 100-day reviews are in, and they\u2019re terrible. The health care faceplants just keep coming; the administration\u2019s tax \u201cplan\u201d offers less detail than most supermarket receipts; Trump has wimped out on his promises to get aggressive on foreign trade. The gap between big boasts and tiny achievements has never been wider. Yet there have, by my count, been seven thousand news articles \u2014 O.K., it\u2019s a rough estimate \u2014 about how Trump supporters are standing by their man, are angry at those meanies in the news media, and would gladly vote for him all over again. What\u2019s going on? The answer, I\u2019d suggest, lies buried in the details of the latest report on gross domestic product. No, really. For the past few months, economists who track short-term developments have been noting a peculiar divergence between \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d data. Soft data are things like surveys of consumer and business confidence; hard data are things like actual retail sales. Normally these data tell similar stories (which is why the soft data are useful as a sort of early warning system for the coming hard data.) Since the 2016 election, however, the two kinds of data have diverged, with reported confidence surging \u2014 and, yes, a bump in stocks \u2014 but no real sign of a pickup in economic activity. The funny thing about that confidence surge, however, was that it was very much along partisan lines \u2014 a sharp decline among Democrats, but a simply huge rise among Republicans. This raises the obvious question: Were those reporting a huge increase in optimism really feeling that much better about their economic prospects, or were they simply using the survey as an opportunity to affirm the rightness of their vote? Well, if consumers really are feeling super-confident, they\u2019re not acting on those feelings. The first-quarter G.D.P. report, showing growth slowing to a crawl, wasn\u2019t as bad as it looks: Technical issues involving inventories and seasonal adjustment (you don\u2019t want to know) mean that underlying growth was probably O.K., though not great. But consumer spending was definitely sluggish. The evidence, in other words, suggests that when Trump voters say they\u2019re highly confident, it\u2019s more a declaration of their political identity than an indication of what they\u2019re going to do, or even, maybe, what they really believe. May I suggest that focus groups and polls of Trump voters are picking up something similar? One basic principle I\u2019ve learned in my years at The Times is that almost nobody ever admits being wrong about anything \u2014 and the wronger they were, the less willing they are to concede error. For example, when Bloomberg surveyed a group of economists who had predicted that Ben Bernanke\u2019s policies would cause runaway inflation, they literally couldn\u2019t find a single person willing to admit, after years of low inflation, having been mistaken. Now think about what it means to have voted for Trump. The news media spent much of the campaign indulging in an orgy of false equivalence; nonetheless, most voters probably got the message that the political/media establishment considered Trump ignorant and temperamentally unqualified to be president. So the Trump vote had a strong element of: \u201cHa! You elites think you\u2019re so smart? We\u2019ll show you!\u201d Now, sure enough, it turns out that Trump is ignorant and temperamentally unqualified to be president. But if you think his supporters will accept this reality any time soon, you must not know much about human nature. In a perverse way, Trump\u2019s sheer awfulness offers him some political protection: His supporters aren\u2019t ready, at least so far, to admit that they made that big a mistake. Also, to be fair, so far Trumpism hasn\u2019t had much effect on daily life. In fact, Trump\u2019s biggest fails have involved what hasn\u2019t happened, not what has. So it\u2019s still fairly easy for those so inclined to dismiss the bad reports as media bias. Sooner or later, however, this levee is going to break. I chose that metaphor advisedly. I\u2019m old enough to remember when George W. Bush was wildly popular \u2014 and while his numbers gradually deflated from their post 9/11 high, it was a slow process. What really pushed his former supporters to reconsider, as I perceived it \u2014 and this perception is borne out by polling \u2014 was the Katrina debacle, in which everyone could see the Bush administration\u2019s callousness and incompetence playing out live on TV. What will Trump\u2019s Katrina moment look like? Will it be the collapse of health insurance due to administration sabotage? A recession this White House has no idea how to handle? A natural disaster or public health crisis? One way or another, it\u2019s coming. Oh, and one more note: By 2006, a majority of those polled claimed to have voted for John Kerry in 2004. It will be interesting, a couple of years from now, to see how many people say they voted for Donald Trump.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/opinion/donald-trump-on-the-power-of-being-awful.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T03:24:08-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-05-01T03:21:17-04:00", "abstract": "Trump supporters will never admit they were wrong.", "title": "On the Power of Being Awful"}
