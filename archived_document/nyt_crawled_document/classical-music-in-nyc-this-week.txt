Harry Bicket and the English Concert are annual visitors to Carnegie Hall, and their series of Handel masterpieces is a continuing revelation. This year it\u2019s \u201cAriodante,\u201d with the bewitching Joyce DiDonato in the title role and a strong cast more broadly, including Christiane Karg as Ginevra, Jo\u00e9lle Harvey as Dalinda, and Matthew Brook as the King of Scotland. This concert-staged opera will be streamed live at medici.tv.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org \u2018CYRANO DE BERGERAC\u2019 at the Metropolitan Opera (May 2, 7:30 p.m.; through May 13). Just four performances of this 1936 Franco Alfano opera, staged in Francesca Zambello\u2019s production primarily as a vehicle for the star tenor Roberto Alagna. Jennifer Rowley is Roxane, Cyrano\u2019s amour, while Atalla Ayan is Christian and Juan Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez is de Guiche. Marco Armiliato conducts.212-362-6000, metopera.org INTERNATIONAL CONTEMPORARY ENSEMBLE at Abrons Arts Center (April 28, 8:30 p.m.; April 29, 8 p.m.). Enjoy ICE all weekend long with a festival of free concerts that ranges over contemporary music with abandon.

The Philip Glass celebrations continue unabated, now with a rarity: a 1980 chamber opera left deliberately abstract, for later directors to complete. R. B. Schlather, one of our more ambitious and effective younger directors, takes up the task. The violinist Johnny Gandelsman, the violist William Frampton and the voices of Choral Chameleon are the performers.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (May 3-4, 7:30 p.m.; through May 9). Back in 2013, when Alan Gilbert last programmed Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 9, he made a musical \u2014 or compositional \u2014 point about that composer\u2019s constant radicalism by conducting the piece alongside the premiere of a Mark-Anthony Turnage work. Four years later, he makes a more political, philosophical statement by introducing the Beethoven with Schoenberg\u2019s \u201cA Survivor From Warsaw,\u201d a 1947 tribute to victims of the Holocaust. The Philharmonic is joined by the Westminster Symphonic Choir, as well as Camilla Tilling, Daniela Mack, Joseph Kaiser and Eric Owens.212-875-5656, nyphil.org OLGA VINOKUR at Bargemusic (April 28-29, 8 p.m.). A regular at Brooklyn\u2019s floating concert hall, Ms. Vinokur has put together an intriguing survey of American piano repertoire for this recital, moving from Barber\u2019s too easily overlooked Sonata in E flat minor to Gershwin, Bolcom, Adams and Rzewski. On Saturday she plays Debussy, Scriabin and Rachmaninoff, as well as Lisztian arrangements of Schubert, if that\u2019s more your thing.800-838-3006, bargemusic.org WALL-TO-WALL STEVE REICH at Symphony Space (April 30; 3, 5:30 and 8 p.m.).
