I mean that it\u2019s a shining example of what a Friday puzzle can be. Heavens to Murgatroyd, as two of the clues say, this was fun. Lots of good, crunchy entries, very little junk and some clever cluing kept me smiling throughout. It\u2019s hard for me to believe that this is an early work of Mr. Gulczynski\u2019s. As he mentions below, GRAMMAR NAZI and GO-GO BOOTS make their debut in The New York Times Crossword today, along with SMEAR TACTIC and TOTAL BASES. But there are so many other terrific entries, like TOT UP, PIE CHARTS, GREAT SCOTT, AFRO POP, HELLO KITTY, ACT OF GOD, PRO FORMA, PAPER CHASE (I still have nightmares about John Houseman\u2019s portrayal of the strict professor Kingsfield in the film and television series.), THE FONZ, HOT DATES and SPY STORY. \u25a0 11A: Here\u2019s a good vocabulary word: BELDAM. Any old hag in a Disney movie would qualify. \u25a0 17A: If you go out to dinner in Britain and you are splitting the bill with friends, someone will TOT UP or total what everyone owes. \u25a0 18A: Maybe I\u2019ve been asked to sit through one too many meetings, but I thought this was hilarious. \u201cBusiness circles?\u201d in today\u2019s puzzles are PIE CHARTS. Put that in your pipe and perform a regression analysis on it. \u25a0 53A: If you are the type to recognize that the word should be \u201cwhom,\u201d not \u201cwho\u201d in the clue \u201cType for who this clue will be annoying?\u201d, you are not necessarily a GRAMMAR NAZI. You are my kind of person. Pull up a seat and sit here next to me. \u25a0 5D: This is The New York Times. The answer to \u201cBoobs\u201d is SAPS. \u25a0 30D: Hey, kids! Back in the 1970s, there was a television series called \u201cHappy Days,\u201d and one of the main characters was a greaser \u2014 ask your parents \u2014 called THE FONZ. It would take too long to explain why this occurred, but suffice to say that the producers of the show decided to have a leather-clad, ducktail-coiffed man playing a teenager literally jump over a shark while water-skiing in an attempt to boost the show\u2019s ratings. No, really. Look: Eric Berlin, the author behind the wonderful children\u2019s book series, Winston Breen, has launched a puzzle website for kids called \u201cPuzzle Your Kids.\u201d If you have kids whose brains never shut off and love puzzles, you can support Mr. Berlin\u2019s work for the low price of $5.00 per month and, in addition to getting a free puzzle every Friday, you\u2019ll receive bonus puzzles, special access to supporter-only contests, and sneak previews of new puzzles.
