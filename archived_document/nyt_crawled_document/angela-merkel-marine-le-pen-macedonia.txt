{"text": "Good morning. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Our journalists spent months in Germany reporting how hundreds of Syrian refugees are adapting to life in the storied city of Weimar, and how residents are adapting to their new neighbors. Here\u2019s what we found: With classic German efficiency, the country led the way in Europe in providing refugees with essential social services after Chancellor Angela Merkel called for constituents to open their communities. But on a personal level, where integration really happens, there are staggering cultural headwinds. \u201cBoth sides will need to change,\u201d one resident said. _____ \u2022 With five months  before federal elections, Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative party alliance is tilting further right to avoid being outflanked by populists. The lower house of Parliament approved draft legislation that would prevent civil servants from wearing full face veils at work. Separately, prosecutors said a German soldier posed as a Syrian asylum seeker and planned a violent attack that risked stirring anti-immigrant sentiment. _____ \u2022 In France\u2019s presidential election, Emmanuel Macron, the centrist candidate, has dropped slightly in some polls, and commentators have suggested that his campaign is stagnating. Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, is using that momentum to depict him as an unpatriotic out-of-touch banker. Mr. Macron is said to have barred Russian news outlets, whose coverage has favored Ms. Le Pen, from covering his campaign events. _____ \u2022 In Macedonia, nationalists stormed Parliament and assaulted opposition lawmakers to protest the election of an ethnic Albanian speaker. The president has summoned party leaders for talks today aimed at defusing tensions. Greece said it feared that its northern neighbor, which has been in a months-long deadlock over efforts to form a government, risked \u201csliding into deep political crisis.\u201d _____ \u2022 Tomorrow will be the 100th day President Trump has been in office. Our reporting team took a look back at what defined the beginning of the 45th presidency. In an interview with the Reuters news agency, Mr. Trump said that a \u201cmajor, major conflict\u201d with North Korea was possible and that the U.S. was losing a \u201ctremendous amount of money\u201d defending Saudi Arabia. The Defense Department is investigating Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, over payments from Russia. _____ \u2022 And a big surprise in science: Archaeologists no longer need to be thrown a bone. Using methods that took years to develop, scientists in Germany recovered ancient DNA from cave dirt, opening the door to new insights on human prehistory. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like discovering that you can extract gold dust from the air,\u201d a researcher commented. _____ \u2022 The European Central Bank has become more optimistic about the eurozone economy and  hinted at winding down stimulus measures. \u2022 Earnings: Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet excelled. Deutsche Bank\u2019s jump in profit wasn\u2019t big enough for investors. And Ford slumped. \u2022  Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Pope Francis begins a politically delicate trip to Egypt today, just weeks after the Palm Sunday terrorist attacks on two Coptic churches. [The New York Times] \u2022 Syria blamed Israel for an attack on warehouses near the Damascus airport. Israeli news reports said the warehouses contained weapons bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. [The New York Times] \u2022 Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said that his country would most likely agree to any American request to aid in strikes on Syria. [BBC] \u2022 Tomorrow, leaders of the 27 countries that will remain in the E.U. after Britain leaves will discuss their \u201cBrexit\u201d negotiating position. Here is our Berlin bureau chief\u2019s take on Germany\u2019s hardening stance. [The New York Times] \u2022 The Palestinian Authority said that it would no longer pay Israel for electricity for the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. [The New York Times] \u2022 Alexei Navalny, a prominent Russian opposition leader, was hospitalized after an assailant sprayed his face with a corrosive antiseptic. [Moscow Times] \u2022 The police in London arrested a man carrying knives near Parliament, charging him with planning a terrorist attack. [The New York Times] \u2022 A French court turned down a Serbian request to extradite Ramush Haradinaj, a former guerrilla commander and prime minister of Kosovo. [The New York Times] \u2022 Skip the university tour. Research on decision-making suggests that talking to former students is likely to offer a better guide. \u2022 Plug in and turn up the volume on your workout. Music is a simple and effective way to make exercise less daunting. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Treat yourself to a deluxe dinner of shrimp tossed in a butter and chili sauce. \u2022 Soccer: The Manchester derby ended 0 to 0. Our soccer correspondent reflects on why the city\u2019s two astonishingly wealthy, unapologetically ambitious clubs have delivered so little this season. \u2022 An Iranian short film was honored at the Tribeca Film Festival, but its director was unable to accept the award in person after being turned down for a visa to enter the U.S. \u2022 The mechanism that allows certain caterpillars to break down plastic could transform the fight against one of the world\u2019s most stubborn pollutants. \u2022 Genoa, the Italian port city that once raised Christopher Columbus and imprisoned Marco Polo, isn\u2019t as well known as Rome or Florence. Perhaps that\u2019s part of its charm. Today, \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d the eighth installment of the action movie franchise starring Vin Diesel, opens in theaters across Japan. But if you happen to be there, you\u2019ll be forgiven for not finding it on cinema schedules. That\u2019s because, in Japan, the movie is called \u201cWild Speed: Ice Break.\u201d This is not the first time that films in the franchise have been promoted under different names elsewhere. Movie titles are frequently changed to resonate better with local audiences. In Japan, the sixth movie in the franchise, which focused on Europe, was advertised as \u201cWild Speed: Euro Mission.\u201d The seventh, \u201cWild Speed: Sky Mission,\u201d included a scene featuring cars falling from a plane. If the latest film\u2019s performance in China (where it was called \u201cSpeed and Passion\u201d) is any guide, changing movie titles can help bolster ticket sales. Of the $432 million the movie made overseas on its opening weekend, $190 million came from China. In Hong Kong, the movie was advertised as \u201cWild Speed\u201d and in Taiwan as \u201cThe Moment You Play With Death.\u201d (In Europe, the title was far more literal: \u201cFast and Furious 8.\u201d) Regardless of where you are, if you haven\u2019t seen the film, here\u2019s our review. _____ This briefing was prepared for the European morning.
