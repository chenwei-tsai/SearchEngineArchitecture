But the methane flare that burns there is incinerating birds.", "text": "NORTH ARLINGTON, N.J. \u2014 From some vantages along the rolling meadow, the gleaming Manhattan skyline can be seen clearly in the distance, rising above the tall grass, beyond the water, roadways and fixtures of industry that dot the New Jersey horizon. But on a bright and tranquil Sunday morning, all of that feels almost a world away. Don Torino has spent much of his life around here, and he has watched as this stretch of the New Jersey Meadowlands has been transformed from a wasteland that sometimes forced residents to pinch their noses into something of a natural treasure. He pointed out the different species of birds \u2014 a northern harrier and an American kestrel, among them \u2014 that called out and swooped through the air as evidence of that evolution. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Mr. Torino said, \u201cyou have a bird killer in the middle of it.\u201d He walked over to a pipe that emerged from one of the hills like an IV from a forearm, coiling around to a stack that released a flame that was virtually invisible, except for a glassy haze. It burns continuously, sometimes reaching close to 20 feet high and temperatures of almost 1,000 degrees. It is one of the signs that the mounds here were formed not by nature but by the mountains of garbage that built up when the area was an open landfill. Kingsland Landfill, as it is still known, has been closed for almost three decades, and in the years since, it has been covered, leaving behind the golden brown foothills that have become a draw for birds looking for a meal. But that flare, burning off methane created by decomposing garbage, poses a potentially lethal threat to unsuspecting birds that pass through it. Larger birds have been found with singed wings, unable to fly or fend for themselves. Bird-watchers believe that smaller ones are simply incinerated. \u201cYou hold your breath when you stand out here,\u201d Mr. Torino, the president of the Bergen County Audubon Society, said as he watched birds fly by the flame. The situation has vexed officials and environmental advocates who have struggled for years to find a solution. The landfill, which stretches over 150 acres, is now controlled by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which has hired engineers and reached out to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for guidance. But, so far, little has emerged. \u201cThe health of the birds and wildlife is paramount to us,\u201d said Brian Aberback, a spokesman for the authority. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking to do the same thing and remedy this.\u201d The severity of the problem has been difficult to measure. Federal wildlife officials said they were aware of at least three birds that had been killed or injured at the landfill in the past four months. But some are concerned that the toll could be far higher. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to survey what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Chris Soucy, executive director of the Raptor Trust in Morris County, which has cared for several birds injured by the flame in recent years. \u201cWe\u2019re only seeing a small slice of the population that\u2019s affected.\u201d In recent weeks, the trust has taken in two red-tailed hawks that had debilitating burns believed to have been caused by the flame, injuries that could have been fatal had the birds not been found. For one of them, Mr. Soucy estimated, it could take as long as two years for feathers to grow back. \u201cThat bird is pretty well torched \u2014 I don\u2019t know what else to say,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of damage to its wings and tail would make it completely unable to survive in the wild and hunt and live successfully.\u201d The Kingsland Landfill is part of a patchwork of landfills along wetlands in Bergen County. At one point, in 1969, a state survey found that 5,000 tons of waste was brought to the Meadowlands daily, arriving from over 100 communities around New Jersey. \u201cIt was the butt of jokes,\u201d Mr. Torino said of the area, its reputation clouded by the stench and environmental toll of the landfills. \u201cNot many things in nature in New Jersey get better. This is one of the places where we could say it got better.\u201d Like other landfills, the Kingsland Landfill was covered in the 1990s and left as mostly open land. But the tons of garbage left behind were still creating methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Many landfills burn off the methane, as is done here, but harvesting the gas has become more of an option. \u201cWe have to deal with it one way or another,\u201d said Monica Mazurek, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rutgers University. \u201cThis way we\u2019re capturing it and using it as an advanced fuel.\u201d Mr. Aberback said the authority had plans to capture methane at another of its landfills, but that was \u201cnot currently a viable option for the Kingsland Landfill flare.\u201d The Fish and Wildlife Service says the authority has already followed through on some of its suggestions, like removing a number of possible perches for birds around the flame. A local electric company has agreed to take out or retrofit power lines and other equipment to make them less attractive to migrating birds. Finding a way to make the flare visible to birds is among the other ideas officials say are being explored. Part of the problem is that the flame never stops burning. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that many of the existing approaches for dealing with this issue are solutions for methane burners that have intermittent flames,\u201d Steve Mars, a biologist in the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s New Jersey office, said in a statement, \u201cas opposed to the structure we are dealing with that has a continuously burning stack.\u201d For some, the frustrating paradox is that the threat looms in a place that has become so enticing for birds. Land that was once piled high with refuse is now covered with grass and wildflowers, inviting insects, mice, small snakes and, then, the birds that dive down in pursuit of the prey. \u201cYou can see the food chain at work,\u201d Gabrielle Bennett-Meany, a natural resource specialist for the authority, said. \u201cYou have quite a dynamic little ecosystem on a landfill.\u201d It has also attracted humans drawn by the subtle spectacle of watching nature unfold. Christopher Takacs, who organizes field trips for the Audubon Society, lives nearby in Lyndhurst, and visits the park sometimes several times in a day. He will come first thing in the morning, or stop by after running errands. More than 280 species of birds have been spotted in the Meadowlands, and Mr. Takacs said he had seen 267 of them. He found one of the red-tail hawks on the ground, and he has rescued other injured birds as well. \u201cThat gets to me a little bit,\u201d he said, tapping his chest. \u201cThese beautiful little birds getting burned.\u201d Mr. Takacs had come around sunrise on this Sunday. The sky came to life above him. A killdeer flew high above, and there were cardinals, a little farther away, sticking closer to the ground. He saw a woodpecker and a kestrel. And there was a European starling that seemed to flutter all around, in one moment zipping right by the flame and in the next dashing away.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/nyregion/invisible-bird-killer-lurks-in-revitalized-new-jersey-meadowlands.html", "material_type_facet": "News", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:26-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "title": "Invisible \u2018Bird Killer\u2019 Lurks in Revitalized New Jersey Meadowlands", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-26T05:00:26-04:00"}
