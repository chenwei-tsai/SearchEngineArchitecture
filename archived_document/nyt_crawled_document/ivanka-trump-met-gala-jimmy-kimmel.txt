Since 1991, the event has highlighted the best of the American food industry. Long before people started talking about celebrity chefs, James Beard was hailed as a \u201ckitchen wizard\u201d and the \u201cdean of American cookery.\u201d Born in Portland, Ore., he dropped out of college and studied voice and theater in Europe. But back in the U.S., acting didn\u2019t pay the bills, so he turned to catering and teaching clients how to cook and serve dinners \u201cin an international manner.\u201d By 1955, he had founded a cooking school in New York with a basic course of six lessons: crepes and sauces, souffl\u00e9s, omelets, bread making, oven cookery and preparing a complete dinner party. More than 20 cookbooks, a pioneering TV show and a stream of formative critiques followed, paving the way for chefs like Julia Child and Marcella Hazan. He died in 1985.
