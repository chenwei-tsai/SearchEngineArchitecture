{"abstract": "To plan your itinerary, here are movies, talks and events, from a documentary on Gilbert Gottfried to \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d", "item_type": "Article", "text": "The Tribeca Film Festival begins this week, bringing its smorgasbord of films, talks, television shows, virtual-reality mind-benders, live podcasts, master classes and more to Downtown Manhattan. We\u2019re offering a suggestion for every night of the festival (and weekend afternoons), with an emphasis on variety. For more information, go to tribecafilm.com/festival. Thursday, 8:30 p.m., SVA Theater Neil Berkeley\u2019s documentary is a one-joke film, but it\u2019s a pretty good joke: Gilbert Gottfried, family man. Mr. Gottfried, the comedian famous for his blue material and dying-donkey voice, lets down his guard (a little) and allows cameras inside the comfortable Manhattan apartment he shares with his apparently sane wife and two well-adjusted children. Friday, 6 p.m., Tribeca Performing Arts Center This television adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian 1985 novel (coming to Hulu next Wednesday) is serendipitously timed, with totalitarianism suddenly on people\u2019s minds. Elisabeth Moss, of \u201cMad Men,\u201d stars as a woman whose rare fertility consigns her to life as a sex slave. After a screening of the pilot, Ms. Moss and other cast members and producers will take part in a panel discussion. Saturday, opens at noon, Tribeca Festival Hub Attending the festival\u2019s virtual-reality showcase can mean waiting in long lines to put on a headset for a 10-minute film. But if the weather\u2019s good on Saturday afternoon, maybe the lines won\u2019t be so bad. Among the 23 such projects, check out Kathryn Bigelow and Imraan Ismail\u2019s mini-documentary, \u201cThe Protectors,\u201d about rangers at an African wildlife reserve, for enveloping action, and Selly Raby Kane\u2019s \u201cThe Other Dakar\u201d for immersive, visually arresting weirdness. Saturday, 6:15 p.m., Regal Cinemas Battery Park A straightforward, bittersweet drama of women\u2019s empowerment, this film by the Italian-Swiss director Petra Volpe portrays the turmoil in one Swiss town as the country prepares to vote on women\u2019s suffrage \u2014 in 1971. Sunday, 3 p.m., Cin\u00e9polis Chelsea Cobie Smulders and Justin Long star in the feature directing debut of the actor Ryan Eggold (\u201cThe Blacklist\u201d), a dark romantic comedy about a man who\u2019s invited to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s wedding. The appealing cast includes Kristen Schaal, Peter Gallagher, Lea Thompson and John Cho, and the final scene will inspire far too many film class papers comparing it to \u201cThe Graduate.\u201d Sunday, 6:15 p.m., Cin\u00e9polis Chelsea This up-close, slice-of-life documentary profiles Daje Shelton, an African-American teenager in north St. Louis struggling with school, family and motherhood. During the two years covered in the film, Daje and her friends see the news that Michael Brown has been killed by the police in nearby Ferguson. Monday, 4:45 p.m., Cin\u00e9polis Chelsea A program of three independent TV pilots that you might see on Hulu or Amazon some day, after some rewriting, changing of music cues and a lot of postproduction. \u201cLost & Found\u201d is like a \u201cLooking\u201d for straight Angelenos, while the eccentric, nostalgic \u201cBlack Magic for White Boys,\u201d set mostly in a flea-bitten New York theater, has a little bit of Woody Allen in its DNA. Tuesday, 6 p.m., Festival Hub The creator (Ms. Dunham) and the showrunner (Ms. Konner) of \u201cGirls\u201d discuss that recently concluded HBO series, and whatever else comes to mind, in a conversation moderated by America Ferrera. Next Wednesday, 6 p.m., Tribeca Performing Arts Center The theater director David Leveaux, a five-time Tony Award nominee, makes his film directing debut with this World War II story about a German soldier (Jai Courtney) assigned to protect the exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II, played by the great stage actor Christopher Plummer. Mr. Leveaux and Mr. Plummer will speak after the screening. April 27, 6 p.m., Regal Cinemas Battery Park The Orthodox Jewish writer and director Rama Burshtein (\u201cFill the Void\u201d) made this unorthodox romantic comedy, which is as much about faith as it is about romance. A jilted Israeli woman (Noa Koler) keeps her reservation at a wedding hall, trusting that God will provide a groom in time. April 28, 6:30 p.m., Cin\u00e9polis Chelsea David France (\u201cHow to Survive a Plague\u201d) directed this documentary about a transgender activist and \u201cstreet queen\u201d whose death in 1992 \u2014 she was found floating in the Hudson River near the Christopher Street pier \u2014 was ruled a suicide. It\u2019s both a true-crime mystery and an elegy for the old West Village. April 29, 1 p.m., Radio City Music Hall Maybe you\u2019ve had the wrenching, exhilarating experience of seeing them back to back, but you probably haven\u2019t had it at Radio City. After the screening (celebrating the 45th anniversary of the release of \u201cThe Godfather\u201d), Francis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and Diane Keaton will converse onstage. April 29, 10:15 p.m., Cin\u00e9polis Chelsea The Taiwanese star Chang Chen \u2014 who has worked with an all-star lineup of Asian filmmakers, including Edward Yang, Wong Kar-wai, Ang Lee, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Kim Ki-duk \u2014 adds the hipster Japanese director Sabu to his list. Mr. Chang plays a hit man who opens a noodle cart as his cover while hiding out in a Japanese village. April 30, 4 p.m., SVA Theater Ms. Kuras, who has worked with Spike Lee (\u201c4 Little Girls\u201d) and Michel Gondry (\u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\u201d \u201cDave Chappelle\u2019s Block Party\u201d), offers a free session touching on all aspects of handling a movie camera. April 30, 8:15 p.m., SVA Theater Live podcasts are a new feature, and on closing night, the festival plays host to an episode of Slate\u2019s Donald Trump-focused show, hosted by Jacob Weisberg and featuring the site\u2019s chief political correspondent, Jamelle Bouie, and the author and former New York Times television critic Virginia Heffernan.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/movies/tribeca-film-festival-highlights.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T17:11:47-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Mark Your Calendar: The Tribeca Film Festival, Day by Day", "created_date": "2017-04-18T17:11:47-04:00", "section": "Movies"}
