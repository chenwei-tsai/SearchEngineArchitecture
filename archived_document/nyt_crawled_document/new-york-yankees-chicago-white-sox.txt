Didi Gregorius has not played at all, Gary Sanchez barely has, and Greg Bird \u2014 his swing as balky as his right ankle until Sunday night \u2014 has missed several games. And yet the Yankees have continued to win, collecting their eighth consecutive victory on Monday night, as another patchwork lineup pounded the Chicago White Sox left-hander Derek Holland in a 7-4 victory at Yankee Stadium. Holliday hit a three-run homer in his return, Aaron Judge hit a two-run homer and Starlin Castro \u2014 the cleanup hitter du jour \u2014 added three hits, giving the rookie left-hander Jordan Montgomery a comfortable route to his first major league victory. If the opening weeks of the season have been instructive, the Yankees might really be something when they get the entire band together. As it is, maladies aside, they are doing just fine. The winning streak, which has helped the Yankees (9-4) to apply pressure on the Baltimore Orioles (8-3) at the top of the American League East, is the Yankees\u2019 longest since 2012. And they have put it together with a lineup that was built to tread water. Monday night was no different: Shortstop Pete Kozma was supposed to be injury insurance stashed in the minors; catcher Austin Romine and first baseman Chris Carter were supposed to be break-glass-in-case-of-emergency reserves; and Aaron Hicks, the fourth outfielder, had a dreadful first year with the Yankees last season. Naturally, then, Monday\u2019s victory was a group effort. Kozma, the shortstop who barely broke the .200 barrier at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre last season, ripped a line drive off Holland\u2019s heel for a base hit in the third inning. After a single by Jacoby Ellsbury and a fielder\u2019s choice, Holliday took advantage of a mistake from Holland. With a 2-2 count, Holland\u2019s fastball ran up and in to Holliday, who hit it 459 feet from home plate. Holliday, the designated hitter brought in on a one-year, $13 million contract, was supposed to be the Yankees\u2019 cleanup hitter, a veteran anchor in the heart of their lineup \u2014 a role in which Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira floundered last season on their way to retirement. But when Sanchez injured his biceps a little more than a week ago and Bird slumped, Holliday moved up a spot to third. A parade of hitters has taken turns hitting in front of, and behind, him. Nobody has moved around more than Castro, who has hit second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth in the past nine games. Castro, who leads the Yankees with 28 total bases, doubled twice \u2014 beating center fielder Jacob May to his left and right \u2014 and dumped a single into left field. \u201cCassie was pretty good driving in runs last year,\u201d Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said. \u201cFor him, it\u2019s not trying to do too much. When he tries to use the whole field, that\u2019s when he\u2019s really dangerous, and that\u2019s what you want him to continue to do.\u201d When Sanchez and Gregorius return, and if Castro, Chase Headley and Judge build on their strong starts, it should give the Yankees some depth \u2014 and some stability, which Girardi prefers. \u201cYou\u2019d like to have some consistency,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cIf you remember the first three or four days, we used pretty much the same lineup. Then we started to get nicked up a little bit, and we had some sickness and some guys were really struggling, so we moved some people around.\u201d Also emerging has been Judge, a right fielder who hit his team-leading fourth homer on Monday. Judge, who struck out at a prodigious rate when he was called up last August, has begun to feast on breaking balls. He hit a 3-1 curveball into the left-field seats to bring Castro across home plate and finish off Holland in the fifth. Judge\u2019s home run made it comfortable for Montgomery, who emerged during spring training to clinch the final spot in the rotation. He was outstanding for six innings. He retired Jose Abreu and Avisail Garcia with runners at second and third to escape the first inning unscathed, and he was rarely troubled after that. He induced inning-ending double plays in the second and fourth, and he retired Melky Cabrera and Abreu with two on base to end the sixth. But in the seventh, he tired quickly. Garcia beat out a broken-bat grounder to the shortstop, Matt Davidson followed with a single to right, and Yolmer Sanchez hammered a 3-1 fastball deep into the left-field seats that brought the White Sox within 7-3 and spelled the end for Montgomery. Adam Warren, who had begun the season with seven and one-third perfect innings of relief, entered and allowed a base runner in the seventh, a hit in the eighth and a run in the ninth. But closer Aroldis Chapman entered and, after a base hit, got a game-ending double play from Tyler Saladino \u2014 the fourth double play of the night.", "abstract": "Hobbled by injuries, the Yankees beat the Chicago White Sox to extend what is now their longest winning streak since 2012.", "section": "Sports", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/sports/baseball/new-york-yankees-chicago-white-sox.html", "published_date": "2017-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Yankees\u2019 Mishmash Lineup Produces Common Result: Another Win", "item_type": "Article", "created_date": "2017-04-17T23:14:19-04:00"}
