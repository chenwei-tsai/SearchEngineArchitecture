He is a career .258 hitter who hits few home runs. What most compelled the Rays to hang on to Kiermaier was his ability to field his position. Kiermaier, hardly a household name in professional sports, represents the new order in baseball, a sport that has been reshaped in staggering ways in recent years by a convergence of statistical analysis and camera technology. There\u2019s a newfound appreciation for players who do their best work with their gloves, not their bats. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it in terms of one of our core players, and what he means to us,\u201d said Chaim Bloom, the Rays\u2019 senior vice president for baseball operations. \u201cBut we do see around the league, more and more, teams are taking note of a variety of skills, and trying to evaluate all the things players bring to the table as accurately as they can.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd defense is certainly one of those things.\u201d It has not always been so. Until recently, baseball executives might have thought they knew good defense when they saw it, but they had little data to work with. Willie Mays, Ozzie Smith and Brooks Robinson \u2014 all stellar in the field \u2014 played long before the arrival of advanced statistics like Defensive Runs Saved and Ultimate Zone Rating. Statcast, Major League Baseball Advanced Media\u2019s proprietary combination of radar and optical tracking technologies, has been heralded as a data revolution. Statcast\u2019s cameras have captured volumes of hitting, pitching and baserunning data in ballparks throughout the league since 2015. Last season, the technology expanded to measure outfielders\u2019 defensive aptitude, including a defender\u2019s arm strength, first step, route efficiency and reaction time. Daren Willman, the director of baseball research and development for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, known as BAM, said last year that he was confident about Statcast\u2019s data and its potential effect on players\u2019 values. \u201cWhere it\u2019s really going to end up is, players are going to start getting paid a ton more money because they play great defense and everybody realizes it,\u201d Willman said in an interview with The New York Times Magazine. Willman\u2019s sentiments seemed validated when Kiermaier, widely regarded as a defensive whiz, signed the extension with the Rays. According to Defensive Runs Saved and Ultimate Zone Rating, Kiermaier\u2019s glove has been the most valuable in baseball since 2014. Statcast\u2019s data further illuminated his fielding prowess with something called Catch Probability. Weighed on a 0-to-100 scale of difficulty, the new statistic measures the rate at which outfielders catch fly balls. Last season, BAM calculated, Kiermaier caught 17 of 26 balls (65 percent) that had a leaguewide Catch Probability of 0 to 50 percent. \u201cThat means he made 17 exceptional catches,\u201d Willman said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cYou\u2019re at liberty to take it as you will, but based off our metrics, those are 17 outstanding plays.\u201d BAM, a company owned jointly by all 30 major league franchises, disseminates its Statcast data equally to every team. What individual teams do with the information is their business. Some front offices, like the Rays, have begun to integrate the research into the value of game-saving defenders like Kiermaier. \u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to evaluate defense and really everything that goes on on the field as precisely as we can,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cAnd having Statcast available to us, even though it\u2019s in its infancy, and we\u2019re learning about it, makes a more precise evaluation possible.\u201d In terms of FanGraphs\u2019 Wins Above Replacement, Kiermaier has been worth about as much as the undisputed stars Yoenis Cespedes, Andrew McCutchen, Robinson Cano and Joey Votto since entering the league three seasons ago. Unlike these players, Kiermaier does not hit home runs or get on base consistently enough to be held in the same regard by most fans. Regardless, the Rays believe Kiermaier, a 31st-round draft pick in 2010, is a unique talent, one who deserves a star\u2019s reward. Bloom said that Statcast\u2019s data on Kiermaier \u201cbacks up what we\u2019ve known for a while.\u201d \u201cEspecially when Kevin got to the upper levels of the minor leagues, and came close to breaking into the big leagues, we knew that we had a very special athlete and player on our hands,\u201d Bloom added. \u201cThat made it a lot easier to target Kevin as someone that we wanted to commit to.\u201d Despite the advances, defense remains hard to measure and hard to understand. The Nationals paid a big price in their trade for Adam Eaton, and the Cubs grossly overpaid for Jason Heyward. Both those players, like Kiermaier, derive their value mainly from their youth and defense. Defense, in contrast to power and the ability to draw a walk, declines progressively with age. \u201cThe skill that will fall off first is speed,\u201d said Jeff Zimmerman, a statistician and writer for the website FanGraphs, \u201cand if that\u2019s a major component of a player\u2019s defense, that will fall off quickly too.\u201d Zimmerman found that 29-year-old center fielders saved about four fewer runs on average per season than those a year younger, according to Ultimate Zone Rating. And they deteriorate further from there. Kiermaier\u2019s skills are so unusual, however, that barring a major injury, his defense should remain superior into his 30s. \u201cEven if he loses a step, he could still be really good,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still a valuable player.\u201d Bloom was hesitant to call the eight-figure extension a watershed moment for baseball. But for a team that spent just $67 million in total payroll in 2016, he acknowledged, \u201cIt might be for us.\u201d Kiermaier\u2019s big payday could still change the way others evaluate players, and how they attempt to use Statcast to turn rows of numbers into tangible dollar values, ones that turn relatively unknown players into multimillionaires. Beyond extensions and free-agent contracts, Statcast could ultimately have a greater impact on arbitration cases. Arbitration, the process by which players with at least three full seasons of major league service time but fewer than six earn moderate salary raises, has been slow to incorporate the new evaluation metrics. Players who excel in more traditional categories, like home runs and wins, tend to be the ones paid handsomely; defense falls by the wayside. \u201cThere\u2019s so many different things that go into the arbitration process, and I think players and clubs all acknowledge that it\u2019s an imperfect process,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cI think the process has evolved over the years, to value different things, so it wouldn\u2019t shock me if it evolved again.\u201d In the meantime, the defense revolution is blossoming one contract at a time. And the Rays and Kiermaier are, perhaps, the face of it.", "material_type_facet": "News", "abstract": "It\u2019s not just sluggers earning fat contracts anymore.
