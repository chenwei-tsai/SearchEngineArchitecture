{"text": "BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela said Monday that he would convene an assembly to rewrite the country\u2019s Constitution, which he said would quell mounting protests against him. But the plan was quickly rejected by his opponents as an attempt to avoid elections. In a televised address on International Workers\u2019 Day \u2014 on which both the president and his opponents held demonstrations \u2014 Mr. Maduro said he would call together what he described as a \u201ccitizens\u2019 constitutional assembly of the people, the communities, the peasants\u201d to rewrite the governing charter. The president\u2019s plan came at a time of deep desperation for his unpopular government. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have been protesting in Caracas and other cities, calling him a dictator and demanding that he schedule elections that his government postponed. To many, Mr. Maduro\u2019s call to rewrite the Constitution seemed like an effort to divert attention from the political crisis he has been facing in the streets and to avoid elections that his governing United Socialist Party is likely to lose, according to polls. \u201cFrom my point of view, they are in a dire situation that they don\u2019t know how to continue using the normal mechanisms, such as having elections,\u201d said Enrique S\u00e1nchez Falc\u00f3n, a legal expert and professor at the Central University of Venezuela. Venezuela\u2019s opposition quickly rejected the president\u2019s proposal. Henrique Capriles, a state governor who narrowly lost to Mr. Maduro in an election in 2013, dismissed the plan as a \u201cfraud\u201d that had been \u201cannounced by a dictator.\u201d \u201cPeople to the street to disobey this madness,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Monday. Mr. Maduro\u2019s supporters urged the opposition to accept the constitutional process as a means of settling their disagreements. \u201cThere are violent groups that don\u2019t understand that violence won\u2019t get us anywhere, and that we must have a dialogue despite our differences,\u201d said Hermann Escarr\u00e1, a legal adviser to Mr. Maduro. It was unclear precisely how Mr. Maduro wanted the Constitution changed. Some legal experts said the constitutional assembly could be used to sideline Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly, which has been attacked by the country\u2019s courts. Venezuela has been rocked for the last month by huge street protests against Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, which have been met with repression by the security forces. At least 29 people have been killed. A dismal economy has led to shortages of food and medicine, and a Supreme Court decision last month to strip power from the National Assembly led to the protests. The court, on Mr. Maduro\u2019s urging, later reversed much of its ruling. But his opponents say he is continuing to govern in an authoritarian manner, and they are demanding new elections. Rewriting the Constitution would forestall any elections, legal experts said. The last president to initiate a rewriting of the Constitution was Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 1999, shortly after he took power and declared his plans for socialist reforms to benefit poor and working-class Venezuelans.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/world/americas/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-constitution.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T21:58:01-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T21:58:01-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Maduro said his plan would quell mounting protests against him, but his opponents called it an attempt to avoid elections.", "title": "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuelan President, Calls for a Rewrite of the Constitution"}
