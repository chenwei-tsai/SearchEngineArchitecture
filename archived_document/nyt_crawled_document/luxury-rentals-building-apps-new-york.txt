{"text": "When Nicole Silver wants to book a yoga class in her new apartment building or notify the doorman that her cousin is staying over while she jets off to Thailand, she does not make a phone call, send an email, or leave a note. She just opens up an app on her phone. In seconds, she is done. \u201cIt\u2019s the first app that actually makes a difference in my life,\u201d said Ms. Silver, a 28-year-old Manhattan lawyer. \u201cIt makes everything seamless.\u201d Ms. Silver is just one of many residents in high-end buildings now getting the app treatment. Living at 7 West 21st Street, an 18-story Flatiron rental building replete with the accouterments of modern luxury living \u2014 including a fitness center, golf simulator and rooftop garden \u2014 she was surprised to learn that the building came with a new perk: a customized app, courtesy of the developer, Rose Associates. While smartphones are ubiquitous and their apps are de rigueur for daily living, developers only recently embraced them. Rose first tested its app last year. Like versions being rolled out by Brookfield Properties, Extell Development and JDS Development, the Rose app offers easier access to the amenities that entice renters to pay more than $4,000 a month for a studio. The typical app allows the resident, with an easy swipe and tap, to complete tasks like paying the rent, booking fitness classes, arranging dry cleaning, reserving common areas for parties, receiving package notifications or telling the resident manager that you need your stove fixed. The Rose app offers discounts for neighborhood businesses looking to promote themselves. \u201cSome of it is as basic as: \u2018How do I reserve things? I want to have friends over for a barbecue on Saturday night. How do I know I can reserve the barbecue?\u2019\u201d said J. Brian Peters, Rose\u2019s chief operating officer. At 555 10th Avenue, a new Hudson Yards development, a residential app is a \u201cvery important aspect\u201d of the building, said Laura Kirschbaum, the vice president for development at Extell. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a tremendous amount of engagement,\u201d Ms. Kirschbaum said. Ninety-three percent of residents pay their rent through the app, for example, she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything through apps.\u201d Residential apps are flourishing as the luxury market, particularly in Manhattan, cools off. With prices plateauing and demand slackening, developers and building managers are turning to new toys to lure prospective tenants. Suddenly, steep prices need to justify themselves, and a rooftop garden is not enough. \u201cThis notion of buildings developing apps to communicate with their tenants and make it more convenient is a great example of how buildings and developers are thinking creatively about alternative concessions and incentives,\u201d said Lauren Riefflin, a senior manager for marketing and communications at StreetEasy, the listings website. \u201cIt\u2019s a product of a changing competitive landscape in the luxury market.\u201d App developers see an opportunity. Francesca Loftus is a creator of hOM, an app used by a number of developers, including Rose, AvalonBay, Brookfield and Kushner Real Estate, the company inherited by Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law. HOM functions somewhat like GoFundMe, allowing residents to propose and rank programming in their buildings. Residents chip in money through their phones and staff members from hOM run events. The app can connect to the calendar in a user\u2019s smartphone to determine the best time for that building-wide Pilates class penciled in for next Thursday. \u201cThe buildings that really understood the value at the outset were luxury rental buildings,\u201d Ms. Loftus said. Now, smaller buildings without the same amenities \u2014 a doorman or gym \u2014 are trying to get in on the act. \u201cIf you can get $2,000 a month on a 300-square-foot studio and also have some sort of community element, it\u2019s such a win, such a competitive advantage.\u201d For the residents who are living the app life, there is no going back. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things you overlook when you move into an apartment building. How are packages delivered? How are groceries handled?\u201d said Michael Gleicher, 30, who lives at 7 West 21st Street. \u201cLife is so much easier now.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/realestate/luxury-rentals-building-apps-new-york.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Real Estate", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T16:15:41-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T16:15:41-04:00", "abstract": "With a smartphone swipe, tenants of high-end buildings can pay the rent, reserve a common area for a barbecue or alert the super to a broken appliance.", "title": "Luxury Rentals Use Apps to Pique Interest"}
