James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, offered another apology to investors on Friday about a \u201cmistake\u201d that led to an inquiry by British regulators into his treatment of a whistle-blower. Barclays said this month that it was being investigated after Mr. Staley sought last year to uncover the identity of a whistle-blower who sent two anonymous letters about Tim Main, who worked with Mr. Staley at JPMorgan and who was hired by the Barclays chief to join the British bank. Directors at Barclays have said they will formally reprimand Mr. Staley and make a \u201cvery significant compensation adjustment\u201d to his bonus after the inquiry. \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Mr. Staley said on a conference call with journalists on Friday. \u201cI was trying to protect a vulnerable colleague, but I should have left the organization to handle it. I\u2019ve accepted the judgment of the board. We are cooperating fully with the regulatory investigation.\u201d On Thursday, Institutional Shareholder Services, a prominent proxy adviser, said that, because of concerns over the inquiry, investors should refrain from voting or abstain when Mr. Staley comes up for re-election to the bank\u2019s board of directors at the annual meeting next month. The apology came as Barclays reported that its first-quarter profit declined 56 percent. \u2014 CHAD BRAY The generally positive momentum for lenders in Europe in the first quarter continued on Friday as the Swiss bank UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland reported their results. Profit at UBS rose 79 percent in the quarter, driven by gains in its investment banking and wealth management operations. Shares of UBS were up about 2 percent in early trading in Switzerland on Friday. The Royal Bank of Scotland returned to a profit in the quarter, a positive sign for its chief executive, Ross McEwan, as he seeks to turn round the lender. The quarterly profit was the lender\u2019s first since the third quarter of 2015. The bank has reported annual losses for the past nine years, but says it expects to be profitable in 2018. Shares of R.B.S. rose about 2 percent in early trading in London on Friday. \u2014 CHAD BRAY", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/dealbook/movers-gdp-corporate-earnings-exxon-chevron-stocks-markets.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T08:11:41-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T08:11:41-04:00", "abstract": "We followed major developments in the markets throughout the day.
