{"text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 The Giants faced obvious needs on their offensive line and at their tight end and linebacker positions as they prepared to make the 23rd selection overall in the first round of the N.F.L. draft on Thursday night. In the later rounds, they might also address a position, quarterback, that has not concerned them since they acquired Eli Manning in 2004. As much as Giants fans shudder at the thought, the team\u2019s general manager, Jerry Reese, has indicated it may be time to begin grooming a successor to Manning, who led them to two Super Bowl victories, earning the game\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award each time. Reese, normally tight-lipped in his predraft briefing with the news media since he rose to his position in 2007, was revealing when the subject turned to an eventual replacement for Manning, who is 36. \u201cI probably looked at more quarterbacks this time than I did at other times,\u201d he said recently. Although the Giants leaned heavily on an outstanding defense last season in finishing 11-5 and securing their first playoff berth in five years, Reese expressed confidence in Manning. \u201cWe think Eli has some good years left to play for us,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are trying to put good people around him as well. Hopefully, the offense can pick up the pace more than last year.\u201d Manning is under contract for the next three years. He has been remarkably durable at a position with a high casualty rate. He has started in 211 consecutive games, the third-longest streak in the league. Brett Favre holds the record with 321 games in a row. Manning\u2019s older brother Peyton started 227 consecutive games. The Giants are eager to identify a potential successor to Manning fairly soon because they have not forgotten the difficult years that followed Phil Simms\u2019s retirement after the 1993 season. Dave Brown, Kent Graham and Danny Kanell all proved to be incapable of filling the critical position. That experience, when combined with Reese\u2019s predraft comment, has led many prognosticators to believe the team might select a quarterback either on Friday night, when the second and third rounds of the draft are conducted, or on Saturday, when the draft concludes with Rounds 4 through 7. A strong case could be made for a late-round pick because the coaching staff would have the luxury of time to mold a raw prospect. Although Manning\u2019s passer rating dipped to 86.0 last season after a career-high 93.6 the year before, the Giants attribute that primarily to shortcomings in his supporting cast. They invested two first-round picks on offensive linemen in the last four years, adding Justin Pugh (2013) and Ereck Flowers (2015). Flowers has not developed at left tackle as well as was hoped and could face a position change. The Giants signed D.J. Fluker, who can play guard or tackle, this off-season with the hope that he can fulfill his potential. He was considered a disappointment after the San Diego Chargers chose him 11th over all in 2013. Reese is expected to do more in the draft to bolster what has been a troublesome unit. Tight end remains a priority despite the signing of Rhett Ellison, an excellent blocker. Wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and the newly signed Brandon Marshall would benefit from a tight end who is a significant pass-catching threat. The Giants have seven selections, one in each round, and typically emphasize the value they attach to a player on their draft board above need. They are expected to stick with the 23rd selection since Reese has never traded up or down in the opening round.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/sports/football/ny-giants-first-round-pick.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:09:38-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:09:38-04:00", "abstract": "Manning, 36, has been remarkably durable at quarterback, but the Giants have not forgotten the lean years after Phil Simms\u2019s retirement.", "title": "Giants Start to Think About Eli Manning\u2019s Eventual Replacement"}
