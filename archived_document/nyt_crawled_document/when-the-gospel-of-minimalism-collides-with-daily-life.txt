{"text": "Minimalism as a lifestyle creed is pretty simple: The less you own, the happier you\u2019ll be. Pare down and declutter, the thinking goes, and your mind will have room to exhale. Minimalists say that it\u2019s about spending more energy on living, less energy on having. With more than six million Instagram posts tagged #minimalism, and four million more tagged #minimalist, it\u2019s a trend that won\u2019t die. And understandably so. The impulse to step off the consumer treadmill can be quite tempting. In theory, minimalists have more time and money to amass something that researchers have found to provide far more satisfaction than material items: memories. Experiential purchases, psychologists assure us, offer deeper emotional sustenance than any new gadget or piece of furniture. Studies suggest that even the perfect Danish modern chair fades into the background after daily exposure. Yet our brains never quite get over the thrill of, say, hiking Bryce Canyon, which yields more psychological bang for the buck. But those who have tried the minimalist way have found that it\u2019s not always as satisfying as design websites and tiny-house blogs insist. For some people, purging did not bring Shangri-La. Like most things, living minimally is more complicated than it may seem. In fact, some people found that their compact homes and minimalist manifestoes came with different challenges, and that the trade-offs were not always worth it. Sometimes, they realized, a little more stuff actually brought them immense comfort. For Karen Bertelsen, a former television host in Canada and now a lifestyle blogger, minimalism was calming \u2014 until it became boring. Her desire to pare down began in 2009, when she suddenly felt that her two-bedroom brick cottage in Ontario looked stuffed to the gills with antiques and lace. \u201cOne day,\u201d she said, \u201cit just started to feel oppressive.\u201d She recalls how, inspired by the virtuously clean-looking homes she saw pictured in Dwell magazine, she thought: \u201cThis is it. I am a minimalist. This is how it\u2019s going to be, everything calm from now on.\u201d And within two weeks, she had gotten rid of almost everything she owned and painted the whole place Decorator\u2019s White, a life reboot. She went full-on Dwell, even building a chicken coop, the de rigueur symbol of suburban simplicity, in the backyard. A year after what she calls \u201cthe incident,\u201d she wrote her first post on her blog, The Art of Doing Stuff, about the day she realized that she just \u201chated every inch of her house\u201d \u2014 and how she came to view white as \u201cthe Botox of paint colors\u201d: She and her home \u201clook younger and fresher for it.\u201d But fairly quickly, Ms. Bertelsen fell off the wagon, sneaking items here and there \u2014 a pair of flea market midcentury lamps, an Empire chandelier \u2014 back to her 1,200-square-foot home. Even more, her venture into minimalism made her realize how much she enjoyed viewing the physical manifestations of memories, reliving moments through concrete reminders. \u201cI want to see the drumsticks from the last Ramones show I went to in 1994, or the rock I picked up climbing a mountain in Vancouver,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see the titles of all the books I\u2019ve read.\u201d \u201cMinimalism sure does suck you in,\u201d she said. \u201cLife looks easier. It seems like your skin will be dewier and your hair shinier \u2014 a happier, healthier version of yourself.\u201d Today, Ms. Bertelsen believes that she\u2019s struck the perfect balance, living in a well-edited space with expressive touches, like the stand, built by a friend, in her dining room that displays one of her riding saddles, a memento from a sport she loved as a child and young adult. But she also kept her backyard chickens from her Dwell phase and maintains that she\u2019ll always be a little bit of a minimalist type inside, too. According to the sociologist Joel Stillerman, author of \u201cThe Sociology of Consumption,\u201d among certain educated, upper-middle-class segments of the United States and other Western societies, there is a connection between minimalist design and a quest for well-being. But minimalism is also meant to project taste, refinement and aesthetic knowledge. \u201cThese people,\u201d he said, \u201care making the statement that \u2018I can afford to have less. I appreciate books and travel and good meals.\u2019\u201d Mr. Stillerman calls these post-materialist values; in other words, simplicity as a form of cultural capital. This concept is evident in a current exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, \u201cSara Berman\u2019s Closet\u201d: an actual closet, meticulously organized and filled with white garments, recreated by the artists Maira and Alex Kalman, Ms. Berman\u2019s daughter and grandson. The installation, according to the museum, represents Ms. Berman\u2019s life from 1982 to 2004, when she lived in a sparsely but precisely decorated Greenwich Village studio after divorcing her husband of 38 years. The closet epitomizes the idea of the city sophisticate that draws so many people to minimally designed spaces. Still, critics chide minimalists for a kind of faux self-discipline. After all, if you can afford to toss your stuff, you can probably reacquire it should you change your mind and, say, come to find that your home carbonation system is indispensable. And living minimally isn\u2019t an entirely new thing. Tiny houses are in vogue, but not mobile homes, which have been around a while. As Dak Kopec, an environmental psychologist at the Boston Architectural College explained, it\u2019s \u201cmore prestigious to say you live in a tiny home than a recreational vehicle or camper.\u201d But there are also potential health problems associated with tiny living spaces. Most notable, some studies have linked crowding-related stress to increased rates of domestic violence and substance abuse; experts worry in particular about the growing trend of micro-apartments in urban centers. To combat New York\u2019s housing shortage, for example, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s administration held a competition to design the city\u2019s first affordable residential tower of micro-units \u2014 single apartments of 260 to 360 square feet \u2014 which opened in 2016. While everyone\u2019s tolerance level for small spaces is different \u2014 there\u2019s no agreed-upon formula for square-footage-to-person ratio, Dr. Kopec said \u2014 each of us can handle only so much crowding in our intimate quarters before it takes a toll. At least in a tiny house or an R.V., as opposed to a micro-apartment, people can retreat outdoors for privacy. Finding the appropriate psychological balance between indoor and outdoor space is also more art than science, and it may take a bit of design trial and error to get it right. Some of us create enough internal stimulation that we crave a minimal home, explained Dr. Edward Hallowell, a psychiatrist who specializes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He describes how we all modulate our outside environment and our private spaces: Someone who lives on a farm, for example, may want to pump up a home\u2019s visual volume, whereas a person living in Manhattan may find that a tchotchke-free home with a white palette helps to create a feeling of equilibrium. Kerri Fivecoat-Campbell is candid about the pros and cons of tiny homes and a minimalist ethos. Her book, \u201cLiving Large in Our Little House,\u201d details life with her husband and their six dogs in a 480-square-foot cabin in the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas. \u201cWhen we first moved here full time, I tried to write in our 10-by-10 bedroom, but it was like working from an airplane seat,\u201d she said. Then it hit her: People go to offices. Her husband worked outside their home. Why couldn\u2019t she build a free-standing structure on their property for her books and desk? \u201cI realized it\u2019s not cheating on tiny houses or minimalism if I build a little 320-foot detached writing studio,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to make this lifestyle work for you.\u201d Like Ms. Bertelsen, she found that her need to preserve childhood memories proved more powerful than she could have predicted. \u201cThe only time I\u2019ve ever really wanted more space and felt sadness over it,\u201d she said, \u201cis when I couldn\u2019t fit my mom\u2019s wedding china in our house after she died.\u201d The china cabinet was far too large, and there was no way to store its contents in their home. The desire to hold on to certain objects as a tangible connection to a lost loved one is another reason she\u2019s thankful for her separate office space; there, she displays many of her mother\u2019s books. Over time, minimalists may also find that they lack the time and energy needed to constantly prune their homes and exist as sparingly as possible. After Hattie Garlick lost her job in late 2012, she and her husband, Tom, declared a spending freeze on all \u201ckiddie consumerism\u201d for the year 2013, vowing to buy nothing \u2014 no toys, clothing, activities or child-targeted foods \u2014 for their toddler and, later, for the baby girl they learned they were expecting. Ms. Garlick started a blog to chronicle her minimalist journey, showing how she found used baby gear and swapped items with friends. The internet named her the Minimalist Mom and the experience inspired her second book, \u201cBorn to Be Wild,\u201d which offers instructions for free outdoor activities that engage a child\u2019s imagination. Now, four years after her Minimalist Mom sojourn, she works three days a week as a freelance writer, with no pressing need to pinch pennies. But most important, she said, she feels \u201cless addicted to spending,\u201d so she\u2019s less panicked about a leaner month or the prospect of any future instability. These days, she warned, their two-story London house is far from minimalist. \u201cLego bricks strewn across the floor, poster paints cluttering the breakfast table, children\u2019s drawings covering the fridge,\u201d she said. In hindsight, she said, some of the trade-offs she made as the Minimalist Mom, like spending days looking for free toilet-training underpants for her toddler, \u201cmay not have been the best investment of my time.\u201d Ms. Garlick cautions those flirting with such a lifestyle change, \u201cChasing any ideal, whether it\u2019s minimalism or anything else, isn\u2019t the way forward.\u201d \u201cFamily life,\u201d she added, \u201cand actually any life probably, is at its best when it\u2019s a bit scruffy and messy.\u201d Being the Minimalist Mom entailed some daily mental gymnastics, she said, and required her to say no to her son about buying certain things, purely \u201cin pursuit of a principle.\u201d Today, she said, she feels more relaxed and happier, without the added worry of so much minimalism.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/style/when-the-gospel-of-minimalism-collides-with-daily-life.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T07:01:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T07:01:07-04:00", "abstract": "Having less stuff doesn\u2019t always bring more zen.
