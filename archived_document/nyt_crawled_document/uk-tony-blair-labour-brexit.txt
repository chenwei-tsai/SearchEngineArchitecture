{"text": "Two decades after Tony Blair swept to power in a landslide victory to become prime minister of Britain, his brand of centrist, pro-European politics seems a distant memory in a divided country that has now voted to leave the European Union. But on the anniversary of that victory, Mr. Blair tried to bolster the sagging center ground of British politics, while predicting that voters might think again about the economically damaging hard break with the European Union that he believes is looming. Britons will vote on June 8 in a general election called by Prime Minister Theresa May, a Conservative, who wants a larger parliamentary majority behind her to negotiate the withdrawal from the European Union required by a referendum last year. Mr. Blair, in an hourlong conversation with the international news media, urged Europe\u2019s left not to reject globalization, while warning that Mrs. May would probably lead Britain to a sharp break with the European Union, or a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. Yet he also argued that once the shape of any departure deal becomes clear, Britons may have second thoughts. \u201cI personally think that when people see the details, they will hesitate,\u201d he said, referring to the complexity of any deal Mrs. May can negotiate. Many would dispute that assertion. And thanks in part to his active role in pursuing the Iraq war, Mr. Blair is a diminished figure in Britain these days, particularly within his Labour Party, which has swung to the left. But his skill in winning elections is undisputed. Capturing the political center ground, Mr. Blair was elected prime minister in May 1997, becoming, at 43, the youngest premier since Lord Liverpool in 1812, ending 18 years of Conservative government and sparking the optimistic \u201cCool Britannia\u201d era. Mr. Blair also later secured two more victories. Yet the Conservatives are now firmly back in power, and the Labour Party is led by Jeremy Corbyn, its most left-wing leader in decades, who trails Mrs. May badly in opinion polls. Citing polls in Britain suggesting that Mrs. May will win in June, Mr. Blair urged Britons to vote for candidates who want to keep options open on Brexit, provide an opposition and deny Mrs. May a \u201cblank check.\u201d Despite the aftershocks of the financial crisis, Mr. Blair believes that centrists can find answers to globalization. He described Emmanuel Macron, a contender for the presidency of France, as a force for change in Europe. The key, Mr. Blair said, is \u201caccepting globalization as a fact, accepting its benefits but preparing people for its consequences,\u201d rather than embracing protectionism or isolationism. Speaking in his London office on Friday, Mr. Blair said he would \u201cnever give up\u201d on the idea of remaining in the European Union, though he conceded that others think is this now impossible. One theory about the coming elections is that, if Mrs. May wins a significant parliamentary majority, she will gain the political space to compromise, and retain close ties to the European Union. But Mr. Blair thinks she is headed in the opposite direction, appealing to supporters of the U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, a right-wing, anti-European Union party, and to Labour voters who opted for leave the union. \u201cThey\u2019re collapsing the UKIP vote into them, and they\u2019re going after the Leave vote from Labour,\u201d he said, sipping coffee (which he gave up while prime minister). \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t strike me as a strategy designed to give you an easier ride on Brexit.\u201d As for the timing of the election, he said it was \u201cthe optimal moment for Theresa May to say, \u2018Give me the strong mandate\u2019 before people actually know what this negotiation means.\u201d When they realize the implications, Mr. Blair said, attitudes may shift. \u201cAll I say to you is it was 52 percent to 48 percent,\u201d he said, referring to the referendum vote to leave the European Union, \u201cand you only need one in 15 of those who voted Leave to change their minds.\u201d Though he plans to vote for Labour, Mr. Blair has pointedly declined to endorse Mr. Corbyn for prime minister, and Mr. Blair\u2019s prescription for progressive politics sounds like a veiled criticism of the current Labour leader\u2019s brand of socialism. \u201cAnything that looks like a form of conservatism of the left is never going to work, because the progressive forces only win when they understand the future and show how they can make it work for people,\u201d Mr. Blair said. \u201cThe chief characteristic of the world is accelerating change, and for the left it has got to be constantly modernizing,\u201d he argued when asked about the failures of center-left parties in continental Europe. As for the United States, Mr. Blair said he was somewhat reassured by President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office. \u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interest that this is a presidency that is a force for stability and not instability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you can see in some of the positions adopted, there is somewhat of a shift from the candidate to the president.\u201d As to his own future, he insisted that he was \u201cnot going back to front-line politics,\u201d but was creating an institute to promote a \u201crenewed center ground.\u201d Looking back to the sunny day when he moved into the prime minister\u2019s office \u2014 a \u201cnew dawn\u201d as he called it then \u2014 Mr. Blair said that \u201clots of things have changed,\u201d before adding: \u201cBut the single thing that\u2019s changed the most is change itself, and that\u2019s accelerated.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/world/europe/uk-tony-blair-labour-brexit.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T00:14:36-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-30T00:08:49-04:00", "abstract": "Twenty years after his landslide election as prime minister, Mr. Blair says he will \u201cnever give up\u201d on the idea of remaining in the European Union.", "title": "Tony Blair Urges U.K. to Stay Centered, and Close to Europe"}
