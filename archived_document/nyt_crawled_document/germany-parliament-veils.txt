{"text": "BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s lower house of Parliament on Thursday agreed on draft legislation that aims to prevent civil servants, judges and soldiers in Germany from wearing full-face veils at work. In December, Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a ban on full-face Muslim veils \u201cwherever legally possible.\u201d With five months to go before a federal election, Ms. Merkel\u2019s party, the Christian Democratic Union, has lost some support to an anti-immigrant party, Alternative for Germany, as Germany struggles to deal with a migrant crisis. More than a million migrants, many of them Muslims from the Middle East, have arrived in Germany over the past two years, and concerns about integration are widespread. \u201cIntegration also means that we should make clear and impart our values and where the boundaries of our tolerance toward other cultures lie,\u201d Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re said. \u201cThe draft law we have agreed on makes an important contribution to that.\u201d Legislation must be approved by both the lower and upper chambers of Parliament before becoming law. In February, the southern state of Bavaria, governed by the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives, said it would ban the full-face veil in schools, universities, government workplaces and polling stations.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/europe/germany-parliament-veils.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "World", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T21:16:57-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T21:16:57-04:00", "abstract": "The draft legislation agreed on in the lower house of Parliament aims to prevent civil servants, judges and soldiers from wearing full-face veils at work.", "title": "German Lawmakers Aim to Impose Some Limits on Full-Face Veils"}
