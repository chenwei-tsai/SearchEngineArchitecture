(Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Not long ago, California Democrats were broadly opposed to so-called sanctuary policies that limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents. But times have changed. A poll conducted by U.C. Berkeley researchers in 2015 found that attitudes on sanctuary policies transcended political affiliation: 82 percent of Republicans and 73 percent of Democrats were opposed to them. But when Californians were asked again last month, while Republican attitudes were largely unchanged, the Democrats showed a remarkable shift \u2014 now, more than 70 percent supported sanctuary policies. What happened? It\u2019s all about context, said Jack Citrin, a political science professor who leads Berkeley\u2019s Institute of Governmental Studies, which conducted the polls. \u201cPartisanship was much less a factor\u201d in 2015, he said. \u201cBut now I would say in California, whenever you ask pretty much any political question that may have some connection to Trump, you get a huge, huge partisan divide.\u201d President Trump\u2019s vow to step up deportations has been deeply unpopular on the predominantly blue West Coast. As a result, the Democrat-controlled State Senate this month passed a measure that would essentially turn California into a \u201csanctuary state.\u201d Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the leader of the State Senate and sponsor of the bill, said it was \u201ca rejection of President Trump\u2019s false and cynical portrayal of undocumented residents as a lawless community.\u201d But Republicans and some law enforcement leaders have argued that the Democrats are getting carried away with their antipathy toward the president. A California law enacted in 2013, known as the Trust Act, already restricts cooperation between local police and immigration officials. Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s measure goes further. Notably, opponents say, it would prohibit local law enforcement agencies from telling immigration authorities about inmates in the country illegally who have in some cases committed serious crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s a double down because of Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u2014 you know, \u2018We\u2019ll show him,\u2019\u201d said Claude Arnold, former special agent in charge of Homeland Security investigations in Los Angeles. As president, Mr. Trump has stepped back from some of the incendiary rhetoric of the campaign, saying his administration would target only criminals, and not young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. California\u2019s Democrats aren\u2019t buying it. In a statement on Friday, Mr. de Le\u00f3n responded with striking language to a warning from the Justice Department that sanctuary cities risked losing federal grant money. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies weren\u2019t just unconstitutional, he said, they were based on \u201cprinciples of white supremacy.\u201d (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) \u2022 \u201cWe had 20 minutes to get out of there.\u201d Rains ended the drought, but brought new misery to homeless people living on rivers.

Seemingly in the middle of nowhere, a grove of lush palm trees rises from the Coachella Valley desert. Robby Sherwin, a reader in Cathedral City, shared a photo he captured last month of the Thousand Palms Oasis, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite places on earth actually,\u201d he said. How do the trees thrive in so arid a landscape? They owe their existence to seismic upheaval. The San Andreas Fault slices through the low-lying valley, where it causes water to gurgle to the surface, feeding wetlands along with plant and animal life. The trees are California fan palms, known for their \u201cpetticoats\u201d of dead leaves. Despite the ubiquity of palm tree species throughout the region, only the California fan palm is indigenous. Long before the trees were used to line our boulevards, Native Americans ate their dates and wove their fronds into sandals, baskets and roofs.
