{"text": "Nearly three decades after they became close friends while skateboarding in Indianapolis, three men who grew up without fathers in their daily lives are grappling with the idea of becoming dads themselves. \u201cThere is a fear there,\u201d Lucy Chandler said of her husband, Lamont, as she sat drinking a root beer at the Sinking Ship, a bar not far from the home they share in Indianapolis. At the time, Ms. Chandler was six months pregnant. \u201cFor one thing, he is his dad\u2019s son,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a terrible father and not there for his mother at all. Knowing that makes him think: \u2018Do I have this in me? Am I going to be like this if something happens?\u2019\u201d Mr. Chandler, 42, didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cDo I feel like that could be part of me?\u201d he said. \u201cAll the time. Totally. What if the DNA is in me? I have to be better.\u201d When Lamont was a teenager, his mother believed he should have a relationship with his father and began sending him to his house occasionally on weekends. It didn\u2019t help. His father worked nights, so he would often sleep during the time he was supposed to bond with his son. By that time, Mr. Chandler was seriously into skateboarding. Having gotten his first board at age 12, a Powell Peralta Lance Mountain, he took to the sport immediately. Unlike other physical endeavors, it was something he could do alone or with friends. It also attracted like-minded kids who embraced the idea of being outsiders, like Tim Cullinan, now a bartender in Indianapolis, and Lee Fennimore, who creates marketing materials for real estate brokers in New York. \u201cAll that anger and sadness and those things, I think riding with my friends gave me something to be positive about,\u201d Mr. Chandler said. \u201cIt let me say: \u2018O.K., I\u2019m not going to have this perfect dad, but I\u2019ve got the support of my crew. I\u2019ve got my boys here with me, and they love me.\u2019\u201d Things with his father never got better. While Mr. Chandler attended Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., his father stopped providing the financial assistance that helped pay for tuition. When his father tried to reconnect over dinner in 2003, the younger Mr. Chandler decided it was too late. It would be the last time he would see his father alive. In 2013, he received word that his father had died. Reluctantly, he went to the funeral with his mother. \u201cWhen I first got the call, I thought: \u2018Man, it\u2019s the worst. I messed up and I should have reached out,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chandler said. \u201cBut there was not ever anything to miss with my dad. At the funeral, I felt bad that I didn\u2019t feel that bad.\u201d By then, Mr. Chandler, who runs his own advertising business, had already met his future wife, a paralegal who specializes in divorces and family law. Early in their relationship, he believed she was the one he was going to marry. He even asked whether she wanted children. Last year, they began trying. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some really rough patches over the last few months,\u201d Ms. Chandler, 35, said. \u201cBut it comes back to him insisting on being there and being the dad. That is the focus. We are having a child. I am scared and ask myself, \u2018Am I going to be a good mom?\u2019 But I have a great mom. I have a great dad. I have a good place that I am coming from.\u201d By Ms. Chandler\u2019s account, her husband\u2019s attitude toward the pregnancy has bordered on rabid. He buys shoes for the baby \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a boy \u2014 whenever he can. He decorated the nursery. He attends classes both with his wife and on his own, and goes to every doctor\u2019s appointment. \u201cI have to connect myself even more,\u201d Mr. Chandler said. \u201cI have a fear of not being connected, of suddenly wanting to bolt. The fear of saying, \u2018See you later.\u2019\u201d In some ways, Mr. Chandler had a harder time than the two friends he skated with all those years ago. Mr. Cullinan, 43, was 12 years old the last time he saw his father, a command sergeant major in the Army who had long been estranged from the family. Mr. Cullinan remembered that he was playing outside with a few other boys when his father and a friend pulled up in a car. His father didn\u2019t bother getting out when he said he was headed for the airport. The two ended up never speaking again, although they exchanged a few emails more than 10 years ago. When his father died in 2009, the obituary listed his children from his new family, but not Tim or his two siblings. Mr. Cullinan\u2019s mother bought him his first skateboard \u2014 a Vision John Grigley Mini \u2014 when he was in eighth grade, and a new life, with new friends, opened up for him. Almost nine years ago, Mr. Cullinan began dating Celeste Napoli. When they got together, her daughter, Beatrice, was a baby, whose father was gone. Over the course of a decade, Mr. Cullinan and Ms. Napoli have had tumultuous periods, breaking up for months at a time. One included an extended time during which he sold almost everything he owned, including his car, and moved to New York. After three weeks, he had decided to fly back to Indianapolis for Beatrice\u2019s sixth birthday party. He and Ms. Napoli moved back in together within the year. \u201cIf Beatrice wasn\u2019t in the picture, it would have been easier if we had broken up and then just let that go,\u201d Mr. Cullinan said. \u201cSo, yeah, she has played a big part in me staying, us working through things. \u201cSometimes I think it has something to do with not having a dad,\u201d Mr. Cullinan continued. \u201cWhen we have broken up, I\u2019ve thought how terrible it would be like to leave Beatrice as well.\u201d Mr. Cullinan is the only father Beatrice has known. But she calls him Timmy. He defers to Ms. Napoli, who works as a social worker for the state, on disciplinary issues. And even though he has gotten used to the routines of parenthood and plans to marry Ms. Napoli, he is unwilling to have a child with her, despite her wishes. \u201cI\u2019m older, and I don\u2019t want to be that dude that is chasing a little kid around when I\u2019m 50,\u201d Mr. Cullinan said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have my first kid now. I\u2019m almost 44. The timing on that is just not good. I can say that all day long, and Celeste would still be like, \u2018No time like the present.\u2019 And I say, \u2018No, that window is closed.\u2019\u201d His friend Mr. Fennimore\u2019s experience, or nonexperience, with his father goes even deeper. Mr. Fennimore has only vague memories to go along with a few photos of the man at his christening. He barely remembers the last time he saw him. It was in grade school. It may have involved a long drive from Indianapolis to Dayton, Ohio. \u201cSome of my friends or girlfriends ask me, \u2018Don\u2019t you miss him and want to know who he is?\u2019\u201d Mr. Fennimore, 41, said. \u201cWhy? I didn\u2019t know who he was then, so why would I care now? My entire life has been me and my mom.\u201d As with his friends, Mr. Fennimore began skateboarding in his early teens. His first board was a Tony Hawk, and skating soon became his identity. The popular kids in high school would make fun of him and his friends for being skater rats, but they just didn\u2019t care. And when Mr. Fennimore went to Indiana University in Bloomington, the same cheerleaders who had looked down on him in high school suddenly found his self-assurance appealing. After college, he had a series of relationships, three of which lasted more than four years. The last ended because the woman he was seeing wanted to have children and he was cool to the idea. It wasn\u2019t that he was totally against it, he said. But having never known what it means to have a father, he has not felt the need to become one. \u201cIf there was a time to do it, it definitely has to happen in the next year or two,\u201d Mr. Fennimore said. \u201cI could have a kid. I could be a good dad. Or I could not have a kid and wouldn\u2019t feel unfulfilled. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m comfortable dying tomorrow. I\u2019ve lived the life that I wanted. But then I\u2019m on a plane and hit turbulence and I think, \u2018I don\u2019t want to die!\u2019 It\u2019s good to tell yourself, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m fine not having kids.\u2019 Then, when you are faced with \u2018I\u2019m going to die tomorrow,\u2019 you think, \u2018I haven\u2019t done anything.\u2019\u201d Mr. Chandler, who continues his countdown to fatherhood, has already told his wife that he wants two children so that their son won\u2019t be spoiled. And he is elated with the idea of giving his son the life he never had. \u201cI want to be there to help him learn and experience the world,\u201d Mr. Chandler said. \u201cI just got into camping a couple of years ago. I want to take him camping. I want to teach him how to bike and read and get excited for little victories. In a way, I\u2019m living through my kid. \u201cIt\u2019s like skateboarding,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t just go and say, \u2018I just did this crazy trick on the first try.\u2019 Likewise, with the kid, I\u2019ll make mistakes along the way. The attempt is better than not trying it at all. You learn from the fall.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/fashion/mens-style/fathers-parenting-skateboarding.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T17:27:05-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T17:27:05-04:00", "abstract": "They didn\u2019t have dads growing up.
