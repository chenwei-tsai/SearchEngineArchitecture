{"text": "As President Trump took the stage to champion the Second Amendment at a National Rifle Association convention on Friday, a United States senator sought to counter his message by unleashing a Twitter storm using the names, ages and pictures of gun violence victims. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who has fought for increased gun control since the 2012 school massacre in his home state, posted on Twitter on Friday morning to urge his followers not to watch Mr. Trump\u2019s speech and instead, \u201cthink about who we are fighting for.\u201d Mr. Murphy then posted 11 messages showing the faces of shooting victims, many of whom were children, including four of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn. In a statement on Friday to The New York Times, he said he had started the tweet storm because he knew that \u201cthe substance\u201d of the gun-control debate would get \u201ctotally lost\u201d amid coverage of the president\u2019s speech in Atlanta. \u201cI wanted to show some of the faces of Washington\u2019s inaction \u2014 to share a small sliver of the lives we\u2019ve lost because our nation is overflowing with guns,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in the statement. \u201cThis issue is only controversial in the halls of Congress. Outside Washington, people understand the horror of gun violence and are increasingly unwilling to tolerate a Congress that is owned and operated by the gun lobby.\u201d A spokeswoman for the N.R.A.\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action said that Mr. Murphy\u2019s posts were a stunt. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that Chris Murphy exploits victims to push a gun control agenda even he admits wouldn\u2019t stop criminals from committing crimes,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Jennifer Baker. \u201cVoters are sick of politicians who spend more time on publicity stunts than solving problems.\u201d The White House did not reply to an email from The Times. But during his wide-ranging 30-minute speech, Mr. Trump told members of an enthusiastic audience that they were his \u201cfriends\u201d and that he had come to deliver \u201cgood news.\u201d \u201cThe eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a true friend and champion in the White House. No longer will federal agencies be coming after law-abiding gun owners. No longer will the government be trying to undermine your rights and your freedoms as Americans.\u201d He added: \u201cAs your president, I will never ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Never ever.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/politics/christopher-murphy-guns-trump.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T20:53:59-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T20:53:59-04:00", "abstract": "Senator Christopher S.
