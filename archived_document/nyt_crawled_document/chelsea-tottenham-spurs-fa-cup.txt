Cup semifinal, 4-2, in Chelsea\u2019s favor over its Premier League title rival, Tottenham Hotspur, at Wembley on Saturday. It was only the fourth time in the famous old knockout competition that a semifinal had featured the current top two in the top flight, and the match did not disappoint. Brazilian Willian, surprisingly selected ahead of Hazard in the starting lineup, twice put Chelsea ahead in a sizzling contest, first after four minutes with a free kick and then close to halftime from the penalty spot. Twice Tottenham roared back with Harry Kane heading them level after 18 minutes and fellow England international Dele Alli making it 2-2 with a superb finish in the 52nd minute. Tottenham, which is four points behind Chelsea in the Premier League after a brilliant run of seven successive wins, dominated at times but it hopes of a first F.A. Cup final since 1991 were sunk by two late moments of magic. First Hazard, who replaced Willian with half an hour remaining, buried a low shot past Hugo Lloris after 75 minutes, then Matic\u2019s 25-meter piledriver sank the Spurs, who have won only one of their last nine matches at Wembley and have now lost in seven successive F.A. Cup semifinals. It was a huge win for Chelsea, which has wobbled lately with two league defeats. It will face either Arsenal or Manchester City in the final when a \u201cdouble\u201d could be on offer. The pregame build up included a resounding ovation for Ugo Ehiogu, the former England defender and Tottenham\u2019s Under-23 coach, who died of an apparent heart attack at 44 on Friday. The semifinal began at a high tempo. Chelsea, with Diego Costa and Hazard surprisingly on the bench, settled quickly and struck first. Spurs defender Toby Alderweireld was a touch fortunate to escape a red card when his desperate tackle ended Pedro\u2019s marauding run, but greater punishment was exacted by Willian, who curled a beautiful free kick past a flat-footed Lloris. Tottenham was rattled as Chelsea swarmed around the pitch threatening a second goal, but Chelsea\u2019s lead lasted only 13 minutes. Christian Eriksen\u2019s corner was blocked, but when the ball came back to the Dane he curled in a low cross, and Kane, almost kneeling, feathered a delicate header beyond Thibaut Courtois for his 26th goal of the season. Alli was becoming more involved and left David Luiz in agony after accidentally treading on the Chelsea defender\u2019s ankle. As Tottenham assumed control, Eric Dier went close to giving the Spurs the lead with a glancing header from Jan Vertonghen\u2019s teasing delivery that floated just wide. Chelsea regained the lead out of the blue. Eating up the ground on a forward run, N\u2019Golo Kante slipped a ball toward the overlapping Victor Moses down the right, and he was sent sprawling to the turf by Son Heung-min, playing as a left wing back, who needlessly slid in. After a short delay, referee Martin Atkinson pointed to the penalty spot and Willian dispatched it past Lloris. Tottenham hit back again in brilliant fashion seven minutes after the break when Eriksen\u2019s teasing ball left Luiz floundering, and Alli, timing his run to perfection, stabbed the ball high past Courtois. Conte reacted by introducing Costa and Hazard with Willian making way and it was Hazard who stunned Tottenham when he was allowed to much space and he fired home through a crowd. Matic then sent Chelsea\u2019s fans into ecstasy with an unstoppable fourth.", "title": "Chelsea Defeats Tottenham to Advance to F.A.
