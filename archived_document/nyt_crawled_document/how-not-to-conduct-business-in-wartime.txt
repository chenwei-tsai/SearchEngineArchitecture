{"text": "Syria\u2019s descent into civil war in 2011 and the rise of terrorist groups drove most foreign companies out of the country. But one French company, Lafarge S.A., stayed until 2014, when the Islamic State seized its cement plant near the Turkish border. Lafarge now admits that it paid \u201cthird parties,\u201d who in turn paid terrorist groups in an attempt to keep the plant running. These revelations recall the immorality of foreign companies \u2014 including Lafarge \u2014 that prospered by working with the Nazis during World War II. Lafarge now faces a criminal inquiry by the French economy ministry and a lawsuit in France by human rights groups and former employees charging it with war crimes and crimes against humanity for paying the Islamic State for security, safe passage for employees and raw materials. The company\u2019s chief executive, Eric Olsen, announced his resignation on Monday, saying he wanted to bring \u201cserenity to a company that has been exposed for months on this case.\u201d While Mr. Olsen maintains he knew nothing about what was going on in Syria, the French newspaper Le Monde reported when it broke the story last June that emails it obtained indicated senior management in Paris was aware of what was happening. The company blames \u201cthe combination of the war zone chaos\u201d and local management\u2019s \u201ccan do\u201d spirit for any wrongdoing. This is a sorry excuse for funding terrorism. LafargeHolcim, as it was renamed after a 2016 merger, said last month that it intends to bid for potentially lucrative work on President Trump\u2019s promised wall along the Mexican border. In France, where the wall is dimly viewed, that has reinforced an image of a company willing to do anything for a profit. Citing the Syria payments and the wall, the Paris City Council voted to end the company\u2019s role in providing sand for the summer \u201cbeach\u201d along the Seine, and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande warned: \u201cThere are markets where one should be prudent.\u201d President Trump or anyone else considering doing business with the company should bear in mind the words of Jeffrey Taylor, a United States attorney in 2007 when Chiquita Brands International pleaded guilty to making payments to a terrorist organization in Colombia. \u201cFunding a terrorist organization,\u201d he said, \u201ccan never be treated as a cost of doing business.\u201d", "source": "International New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/how-not-to-conduct-business-in-wartime.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T08:37:57-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Editorial", "created_date": "2017-04-28T08:34:08-04:00", "abstract": "A French company that paid terrorists in an attempt to keep a Syrian plant running is still finding excuses for its actions.", "title": "How Not to Conduct Business in Wartime"}
