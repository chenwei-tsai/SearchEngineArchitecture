{"text": "As he closes in on completing his first 100 days in office, Donald J. Trump reflected on how his life has changed since he became president and the challenges he faces. In an interview on Thursday with Reuters, the president offered these assessments: \u201cI loved my previous life,\u201d Mr. Trump told Reuters. \u201cI had so many things going. This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.\u201d \u201cThere is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely.\u201d Referring to President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Trump said: \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to see turmoil and death. He doesn\u2019t want to see it. He\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s a very good man and I got to know him very well ...\u201d \u201cAs to whether or not he\u2019s rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he\u2019s rational.\u201d \u201cI get a call from Mexico yesterday, \u2018We hear you\u2019re going to terminate Nafta.\u2019 I said that\u2019s right. They said, \u2018Is there any way we can do something without you \u2013 without termination?\u2019 I said, \u2018What do you want to do?\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, we\u2019d like to negotiate.\u2019 I said we\u2019ll think about it. Then I get a call, and they call me, I get a call from Justin Trudeau and he said, \u2018We\u2019d like to see if we can work something out,\u2019 and I said that\u2019s fine. Because I\u2019ve always \u2014 I\u2019ve been very consistent. It\u2019s much less disruptive if we can make a fair trade deal than if we terminate.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re really into your own little cocoon, because you have such massive protection that you really can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d When the president travels, it is usually in a limousine or an S.U.V. He said he missed being behind the wheel, Reuters said. \u201cI like to drive,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t drive any more.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/politics/trump-interview-quotes.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T08:25:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T08:25:07-04:00", "abstract": "On North Korea, on Nafta, on life in the White House: Highlights from Mr. Trump\u2019s interview with Reuters on Thursday to mark his first 100 days in office.", "title": "Trump on Being President: \u2018I Thought It Would Be Easier\u2019"}
