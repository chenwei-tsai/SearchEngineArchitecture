{"text": "The path that led Michael Ruhlman to Ann Hood began in 1988 at the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference in Vermont. \u201cI saw Ann, who had already established herself as a great writer, walking down a path, arm-in-arm, with two other novelists,\u201d Mr. Ruhlman recalled. \u201cAt the time, I was an aspiring writer trying to ingratiate myself with as many novel and fiction writers as I could.\u201d So he decided to call out her name and tell her just that. \u201cI just sort of yelled \u2018Ann Hood\u2019 in her direction,\u201d Mr. Ruhlman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did it, I just did.\u201d Ms. Hood, who a year earlier had written her first novel, the best-selling \u201cSomewhere Off the Coast of Maine,\u201d turned toward Mr. Ruhlman with a puzzled look. \u201cWell, what do you want to do?\u201d she asked after their brief and awkward introduction. \u201cI want to write fiction,\u201d he replied. She stared at him for a moment, and the pieces of her puzzled face began forming a bright smile. Then came a two-word prophecy. \u201cYou will,\u201d she told him before moving on. They would return to their own paths that would not cross again for 20 years, though Mr. Ruhlman, now 53, continued to maintain what he called \u201ca literary crush\u201d on Ms. Hood, now 60. \u201cI didn\u2019t know her to actually love her, but over the years, I fell in love with everything about her writing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the back of my mind, I always remembered how she inspired me on that path in Vermont.\u201d Two decades later, Ms. Hood and Mr. Ruhlman met again in Cleveland, at a 2008 weekend writers\u2019 conference where both were scheduled to speak. By then, Ms. Hood was married with two children and had written other best-selling books, as well as numerous short stories and magazine articles. She was also teaching creative writing courses while splitting time between homes in Providence, R.I., and Manhattan. Mr. Ruhlman, a Duke graduate, had established himself as a nonfiction writer who collaborated with chefs to produce books like \u201cThe Making of a Chef\u201d (1997) and \u201cThe Reach of a Chef\u201d (2006). As she waited for her turn to speak, Ms. Hood noticed what she described as \u201ca very, very good-looking man\u201d walking into the room. \u201cI said to my friend: \u2018Who is that guy? He\u2019s really cute,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hood recalled. Ms. Hood, who did not recall meeting Mr. Ruhlman 20 years earlier, will never forget what happened next. \u201cThe same cute guy I was asking about gets up in this crowded room filled with influential writers, and says, \u2018I\u2019m a little nervous today because Ann Hood is in the audience, and I\u2019ve been in love with her since 1988.\u2019\u201d Later, Mr. Ruhlman was signing one of his books when he looked up at the next person in line and saw Ms. Hood standing there. \u201cHe kind of jumped up when he saw me,\u201d she said. \u201cI joked with him a bit, saying that, typically, I would usually know if someone had a crush on me for 20 years.\u201d Before their paths diverged once more, Mr. Ruhlman said to Ms. Hood, \u201cThe next time you\u2019re in Cleveland, give me a call and I\u2019ll cook dinner for you.\u201d Ms. Hood laughed. \u201cI knew I would never be in Cleveland again,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we exchanged books and email addresses and said our goodbyes.\u201d But they managed to stay in touch, chatting on occasion via email and text, each learning a little bit more about the other with every press of a send button. Ms. Hood, born in West Warwick, R.I., grew up with a passion for telling her own stories. \u201cWhen I was a kid, 12, 13 and 14 years old, living in my little tiny town in Rhode Island and dreaming of being a writer, I used to sit on my bed and listen to Simon and Garfunkel,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had a song called \u2018The Dangling Conversation\u2019; it\u2019s actually a very depressing song, but there\u2019s a line in it that goes, \u2018You read your Emily Dickinson and I my Robert Frost,\u2019 and I used to think that someday I\u2019m going to meet a guy who loves poetry like I do, and we are going to talk about Robert Frost and Emily Dickinson.\u201d Along the way to reaching her goals, Ms. Hood made a few detours. After graduating from the University of Rhode Island, she worked as a T.W.A. flight attendant from 1978 to 1986, living in Boston, St. Louis and New York. \u201cI went from asking people if they wanted beef or chicken for dinner to writing best-selling novels and attending the most incredible book parties ever,\u201d said Ms. Hood, who was still at T.W.A. when she earned a master\u2019s degree in American literature at New York University. But her own story was not without tragedy. In 2002, her 5-year-old daughter, Grace, died from a virulent form of strep, driving Ms. Hood into a depression so dark that she could not write a sentence for a year. She began coping with the pain through long knitting sessions and expressed her grief the best way she knew how \u2014 through her powerful prose. In 2006, Ms. Hood wrote about her daughter\u2019s death in a Modern Love column for The New York Times. Mr. Ruhlman recalled breaking down in tears when he read the column. \u201cI cannot imagine losing a child and the pain and suffering that goes along with that,\u201d said Mr. Ruhlman, a native of Cleveland who raised a daughter and a son there with his wife. In fall 2014, another of Ms. Hood\u2019s books, \u201cAn Italian Wife,\u201d had just been published. In an attempt to help promote it, Ms. Hood\u2019s publicist asked her if she knew of any food writer who might be willing to take Ms. Hood out to an Italian restaurant to interview her about her Italian roots and her grandmother\u2019s cooking. She asked Mr. Ruhlman, who gladly accepted. She was living in Providence at that time \u2014 three years after Grace\u2019s death, Ms. Hood and her husband had adopted a daughter, Annabelle \u2014 and he was still in Cleveland. But they discovered they had studio apartments in Manhattan that were a block apart. They met at a West Village restaurant, where the interview did not go exactly as hoped \u2014 in fact, it was better. \u201cThe food was terrible and the place was noisy, but the company was delightful,\u201d Ms. Hood said. \u201cWe knew that we were kindred spirits that first night.\u201d Indeed, when Ms. Hood asked Mr. Ruhlman if he could recite any poem verbatim, he chose \u201cFire and Ice\u201d by Frost. \u201cIt was literally a dream come true,\u201d said Ms. Hood, her voice beginning to crack. \u201cA feeling just rushed over me, like I was hit by a tsunami.\u201d Later that week, Ms. Hood was giving a reading at the Italian American Museum in Little Italy, and Mr. Ruhlman returned to take her out to another restaurant for a do-over of the interview. The morning after, Ms. Hood left a phone message for Mr. Ruhlman in which she recited Dickinson\u2019s \u201cThere\u2019s a Certain Slant of Light.\u201d That served \u201cto sort of fulfill the prophecy,\u201d Mr. Ruhlman said. \u201cI began to feel as if I had known her my whole life.\u201d The next week, Mr. Ruhlman had his first work of fiction \u2014 a collection of novellas called \u201cIn Short Measures,\u201d sold to a publisher, bringing to fruition Ms. Hood\u2019s prophecy. And now he was living out yet another dream: being friends with his longtime literary crush. By spring 2016, both Ms. Hood and Mr. Ruhlman were divorced. On Dec. 9, Ms. Hood\u2019s birthday, Mr. Ruhlman asked her to marry him, \u201csooner, rather than later,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew what we had from the start, so why wait?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have both lost close friends, some of them in their 50s, so we know that life can be too short \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t allow ourselves to believe that it is still early morning, when\u2019s it\u2019s actually late in the afternoon.\u201d They were married on April 20 on an overcast day at Abingdon Square in Manhattan, with a few relatives and friends on hand. Laura Lippman, the crime-writing novelist and a longtime friend of Ms. Hood, became a Universal Life minister to officiate. She told those assembled, \u201cThis is an occasion born of a particular postponement, of years lived and miles spanned, only to circle back to that path in Vermont where a man called a woman\u2019s name and she turned and responded to his greeting.\u201d Ms. Hood read \u201cMaster Speed\u201d by Frost. Two such as you with such a master speed Cannot be parted nor be swept away. Her daughter, Annabelle, read Dickinson\u2019s \u201cHope Is the Thing With Feathers.\u201d That perches in the soul \u2014  And sings the tune without the words \u2014  And never stops \u2014  at all After the ceremony, Mr. Ruhlman took Ms. Hood by the hand and they traveled their first path together as husband and wife, making their way through the city streets, past construction workers and honking horns on their way to the reception at Barbuto, a restaurant several blocks away. Following behind were their guests, including Ms. Hood\u2019s mother, Gloria Hood; her son, Sam; and Annabelle. Mr. Ruhlman was trailed by his mother, Carole Ruhlman; and son, James. Mr. Ruhlman said of Ms. Hood: \u201cI get the sense that from the moment I was born, I started knowing her. There is the platonic notion of love in which Plato postulated that one soul is separated from the other at birth and they each spend the rest of their lives searching for the other half. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s true,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I\u2019ve finally found the soul I\u2019ve been searching for.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/fashion/weddings/ann-hood-marries-michael-ruhlman-writers.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T14:05:21-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T14:05:21-04:00", "abstract": "Michael Ruhlman long had a literary crush on Ann Hood.
