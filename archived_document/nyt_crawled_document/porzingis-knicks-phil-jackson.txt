{"text": "It\u2019s not as if the Knicks weren\u2019t warned; they can\u2019t be surprised. Almost two years ago, Kristaps Porzingis announced himself to America as different, as driven, as not your just-grateful-to-be-here European tall man. He sat down shortly before the 2015 N.B.A. draft and told Yahoo Sports: \u201cI don\u2019t like being labeled soft. I\u2019m very hungry. I love the game. I\u2019ve got to prove to coaches and G.M.s that I\u2019m not soft just because I\u2019m from Europe.\u201d This, of course, was very good news. Porzingis was shooing away stereotypical suggestions and fears that he might be a skyscraping international bust. Targeting the doubters in New York, his predraft destination of choice, he was promising that in no way was he going to be another Andrea Bargnani or Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Weis, two European skeletons in the Knicks\u2019 closet. \u201cI want people to get to know me,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the mystery man from Europe.\u201d Not much later, after the shock wore off that the Knicks had chosen this startlingly long 19-year-old, bedecked on draft night in a loud burgundy suit, New York was pinching itself and praying Porzingis wasn\u2019t too good to be true. The city\u2019s basketball-loving masses were dazzled by his confident smile, his cultural ease and his knack for an enlightening quotation or quip. Should anyone now be astonished that Porzingis, after two seasons of standard Knicks dysfunction, has begun acting out like any American-born prodigy, trying to set the rules in a calculated mind game of truth or consequence? Unhappy with the direction of the franchise and the chaos and haplessness of Phil Jackson\u2019s reign as team president, Porzingis blew off his season-concluding exit meeting with Jackson two weeks ago. He rode around Manhattan on a bicycle and then went home to Latvia, where he announced he would play this summer for his national team \u2014 despite nagging injuries that limited him this season to 66 games \u2014 even though the Knicks would rather he not. Be it out of his own frustration or in combination with someone\u2019s advice, he has become a behavioral hybrid \u2014 a petulant 21-year-old who is also demonstrating a tired-of-the-nonsense leadership and delivering to James L. Dolan the badly needed message that the Knicks franchise is officially on the clock. Dolan, as the team\u2019s owner, needs to stop hiding behind Jackson and remember that within a few years Porzingis will have free-agent options. In a recent interview with a Latvian magazine, Porzingis, while expressing a diplomatic desire to remain in New York, added that winning would be his priority and the motivation in any eventual long-term decision-making process. Yes, we heard that from Porzingis\u2019s early career mentor, Carmelo Anthony, who ultimately re-signed with the Knicks as a free agent, talking himself into the belief of Jackson as the franchise savior. Just a hunch, but the Knicks shouldn\u2019t count on Porzingis hanging around New York beyond his contractual obligation just for the sake of building his brand. Porzingis has played for three coaches in two seasons. Derek Fisher, coach No. 1, was whacked by Jackson halfway through Porzingis\u2019s rookie season. Kurt Rambis, coach No. 2, was widely disliked and distrusted as Jackson\u2019s puppet. Jeff Hornacek, coach No. 3, was promised by Jackson the freedom to implement the offense of his choosing and then embarrassingly usurped. Compound the coaching carousel with the triangle travails; Jackson\u2019s bizarre behavior toward Anthony, the news media and others; and the excellent view Porzingis had from the free-throw line of Charles Oakley being hustled out of Madison Square Garden by security guards in February, and who would blame him for wondering what difference there is between the N.B.A. and the A.C.B. league in Spain? In the season before he came here, Porzingis was a rising teenager for C.B. Sevilla, a franchise on the verge of a nervous breakdown. In deep financial trouble, ownership was transferred from a Spanish bank to an American entrepreneur, who turned out to be a cyclone of destabilization, wrecking the season and almost causing the team to fold. After Porzingis was drafted by the Knicks, his older brother and adviser, Janis, told The New York Times that Kristaps had been unfazed by the misadventures in Seville, Spain. \u201cMaybe for the older players, what happened there affected them more because it\u2019s their job, their way to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the younger ones, I think it was easier because they only want to play, get better.\u201d That was then. The Knicks are now. Porzingis knows he hasn\u2019t wasted his time in New York, but he believes both losing seasons were made much worse by a noxious environment. A person in the N.B.A. familiar with Porzingis\u2019s situation and speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on Knicks personnel, said Porzingis had been expressing frustration with the operation of the franchise as far back as December. \u201cThe worst thing is, he knows he didn\u2019t get better this year,\u201d the person said. \u201cHow could he when they bring in Derrick Rose, a point guard who doesn\u2019t pass the ball? With Kristaps, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ve gotten themselves in a very difficult situation, and I don\u2019t know how they get out of it.\u201d Yes, Porzingis might have chosen a more mature way to express his dissatisfaction with Jackson. Conversely, that would have been private, and clearly the point to the petulance was to make this public, and to ensure that Dolan, most of all, knew how he felt. The anticipated dealing of Anthony and the total rebuild that will logically follow \u2014 around Porzingis and other young players \u2014 are likely to mean that Porzingis won\u2019t see the N.B.A. playoffs for at least the first four or five years of his career. That is hardly enticing, but how can the Knicks meaningfully improve via free agency when Jackson has made such a mess of the franchise\u2019s curb appeal to the league\u2019s stars? For the foreseeable future, Porzingis will be a Knick, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has to accept having no say in what they do. Remember, he arrived in America declaring he was well versed in the language and culture of the game. And for two years, he has watched closely as Jackson and Anthony struggled for control, the team president with 11 coaching championship rings and the shooter with the no-trade clause. Porzingis versus Jackson may be next on the card. The willful Latvian, no Euro softy, won\u2019t be empowered by his contract, but beware the fortitude of his cause.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/sports/basketball/porzingis-knicks-phil-jackson.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T12:34:37-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T12:34:37-04:00", "abstract": "After two seasons of Knicks dysfunction, can anyone be surprised that Kristaps Porzingis has publicly grown tired of team leadership?", "title": "From the Start, Porzingis Made It Clear He Wouldn\u2019t Be Timid"}
