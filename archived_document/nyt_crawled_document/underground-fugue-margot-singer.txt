{"text": "UNDERGROUND FUGUE By Margot Singer 290 pp. Melville House. $25.99. Margot Singer\u2019s first novel is set in London during the summer of the deadly terrorist bombings of 2005, but it\u2019s less a panoramic portrait of a city under siege than a study of four troubled characters. Running away from a failing marriage and the traumatic memories of her teenage son\u2019s accidental death, Esther has come to London from New York to nurse her dying mother during her final days. Slipping in and out of morphine-induced dreams in which she relives her desperate escape from Central Europe in 1939 \u2014 \u201cAnother story floats upward toward the light\u201d \u2014 Lonia lies in her sickbed in her North London home. Next door are new neighbors: Dr. Javad Asghari, a research neuroscientist, originally from Iran but a resident of Britain for the past 25 years, and his 19-year-old son, Amir, an undergraduate studying Middle Eastern history and politics at the University of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies. From Charles Dickens to Peter Ackroyd, novelists have written about London as a place where people from all walks of life find themselves connected to one another \u2014 \u201ca web so taut and tightly drawn that the slightest movement of any part sent reverberations through the whole,\u201d as a character in Ackroyd\u2019s novel \u201cThree Brothers\u201d describes \u201cBleak House.\u201d Singer\u2019s London, by comparison, is one of missed connections, miscommunications and misinterpretations. \u201cIt was a mystery how two people ever came together. Life flung you out like an elemental particle colliding and dividing, spinning into space,\u201d Javad muses, standing on the busy Euston Road as \u201ccars and people stream past like synapses across basal ganglia, like a time-lapse photograph of lights.\u201d Singer\u2019s characters experience a city in which \u201cthe boundaries seemed fixed. You could assimilate \u2014 perfect your accent, make a fortune, change your name \u2014 but the real England remained as inaccessible as the city\u2019s private clubs and gardens, locked away behind wrought iron gates.\u201d As such, barring the most obvious of associations \u2014 shared blood or postal codes \u2014 the lives of her four central characters aren\u2019t so much intertwined as running in parallel. This isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s no delight to be found in these often perceptive and delicately drawn portraits \u2014 in particular those of Esther, whose \u201cmoorings have been cut free,\u201d and Javad, haunted by the \u201cnostalgia of an exile he\u2019s condemned to bear\u201d \u2014 but their interactions are decidedly less convincing. That Esther suspects Javad\u2019s son of involvement with the bombings is a story line with potential, but Singer neglects to prepare for it with sufficiently convincing groundwork. Nor does she adequately follow through on the implications of this accusation, merely flirting with the very real and dangerous climate of fear that infected the city in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. Of course, London has a long history of politically motivated violence: from Guy Fawkes\u2019s plot through the \u201cGreenwich Bomb Outrage\u201d in 1894 (which partly inspired Joseph Conrad\u2019s novel \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d) to the I.R.A. bombing campaign that set the capital on alert for decades. Thus, to depict what has come to be known as the 7/7 bombings as a self-contained occurrence seems like a further lost opportunity. Although Singer, who is the author of a well-regarded story collection, \u201cThe Pale of Settlement,\u201d successfully demonstrates depth and richness in the initial construction of the psychologies of each of her characters, these qualities are missing when it comes to both the broader backdrop of the action and, more important, the novel\u2019s narrative cohesion. At the close, there\u2019s a fugue-like absence where there should be congruence and meaning.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/books/review/underground-fugue-margot-singer.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:28-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Review", "created_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:28-04:00", "abstract": "Margot Singer\u2019s novel \u201cUnderground Fugue\u201d follows the intermingled fortunes of four Londoners in the summer of the terrorist bombings.", "title": "Two Immigrant Families Intertwine During London\u2019s Summer of Bombs"}
