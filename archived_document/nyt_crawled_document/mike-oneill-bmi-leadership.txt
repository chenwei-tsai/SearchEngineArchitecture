{"text": "This interview with Mike O\u2019Neill, chief executive of BMI, a music-rights management company, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant. Q. What were your early years like? A. I grew up in Oceanport, N.J. It\u2019s the same town I live in now. I have three brothers and a sister. We all live there still, except for my younger brother, who moved 20 minutes south. He was a little bit of a rebel. Being the middle child allowed me some freedom, because I was building bridges between the younger two and the older two. I got to play in that vacuum a little bit, which allowed me to be somewhat independent and creative. If I needed attention, I had to work to get it, whether it was through athletics, doing well in school or having conversations with my parents about the events of the day. My parents had a few rules that allowed us to be independent as kids. We had to watch each other\u2019s backs and trust each other, and we also had to respect everybody else and be accountable. They gave us a lot of room. They were the opposite of helicopter parents. What were you doing outside of class? I was captain of the basketball team. We grew up a mile from the ocean, so for many summers, until I graduated from college, I was a lifeguard. I also bartended at night. With those jobs, you always had to be aware of your surroundings and to stop anything bad from happening. It\u2019s hard work to have that sustained focus. What are some key leadership lessons you\u2019ve learned? You can\u2019t treat everybody the same. People are different. You can have a tendency to think everyone\u2019s going to receive information or react to it like you would, and they\u2019re not. That was a key insight for me. There was also a learning curve around the idea that I might get information at a point in time and start acting on that. But there\u2019s a whole group of people who don\u2019t have that information, so you have to distill it for them, and get them on the same page in order to move forward. What are some specifics about your culture? One of my favorite things when we go into a staff meeting is to say: \u201cAnybody waiting on a call? Is there an emergency? If not, turn your phones off. We\u2019re here for 35 minutes to an hour, whichever it may be. We can focus for that. If you have something that\u2019s time sensitive, you can step out of the room and do it, but just let us know beforehand.\u201d Have you always done that? Always. It\u2019s like sitting on that lifeguard stand. You could focus for an hour. The internet is very intrusive in that way. I used to sit in meetings and see people on their phones and wonder, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Any other pet peeves? Entitlement. Sometimes people have a title and they assume authority. That bothers me. You have to earn that title every day. You have to do more than everybody else to keep that title, and not to be seen as living off somebody else\u2019s work. How do you hire? When I interview people, I want to know if they have those same qualities that my parents expected from us: trust, respect, accountability and watching others\u2019 backs. And I learn more by asking them about the people they surround themselves with than I do by asking them direct questions. So I\u2019ll ask about their last job. Who was the person you really wanted to work for? Who was the person you wanted to run from? Why? What were the traits of those people? And when I interview people, I usually do one in the office and then I try to do one outside the office, and I make the person pick the restaurant. Because? I want to see if they\u2019re trying to impress me, or if they make me go to them or they come to me. What do they order? What are they thinking? Are they trying to please the C.E.O.? One of my first questions when I sit down is: \u201cThis is a great place. Why did you pick it?\u201d Some people will say, \u201cI was nervous when you asked me to pick it.\u201d I love that answer because they\u2019re being very candid with me at that point. If you only had five minutes to interview someone, what would you ask them? Tell me about the current environment you\u2019re in or the current position you hold. What don\u2019t you like about the culture of the place or the person you\u2019re working with? Why are you looking to leave? I love those questions, because they allow you to see whether the person is leaving for money, or because of the culture, or for a new opportunity. What are they looking for in their lives that they\u2019re not getting in their current environment? And do I have something that I could offer them that might fit that role? It will allow me to see that immediately. There are right and wrong flavors of answers. And they might have the absolute correct answer, but I might not have the solution for them. So I know even if I offer them a job, it\u2019s not going to satisfy what they need.  Advice for new college grads? The first would be to treat everybody with respect. The second thing is that it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t become chief executive when I graduated college. It took me a long time, and part of that journey is fun. You\u2019ve got to enjoy the ride. So don\u2019t be so aggressive. You can be assertive, but if you\u2019re overly aggressive, you\u2019re going to ruin your opportunities. Sometimes you have to let the organization pull you. Some of the best jobs were given to me that I didn\u2019t even realize were coming. Some of the worst jobs I\u2019ve had were when I pushed for them, and I discovered that I wasn\u2019t ready for the job.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/mike-oneill-bmi-leadership.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T07:00:30-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T07:00:30-04:00", "abstract": "The chief executive of BMI says his former job as a lifeguard taught him the importance of paying attention.", "title": "Mike O\u2019Neill Wants You to Put Away Your Phone"}
