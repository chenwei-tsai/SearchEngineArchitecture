Early in the 20th century, there was a fundamentalist culture that effectively rejected scientific and rationalist challenges to its beliefs, but it is even less the behemoth its adversaries imagine. Scientific biblical scholarship (historical/critical) has made big inroads among evangelical intellectuals, causing notable defections from the doctrine of biblical inerrancy and weakening its hold. Ms. Worthen alludes to this in referring to the growing open-mindedness in evangelical colleges. Greater integration by evangelicals into the American mainstream has also broadened attitudes. In my travels for a book about the place of the Bible in our national life, I was repeatedly struck how readily many evangelicals interpreted portions of Scripture as metaphor and allegory rather than as literal fact. A diminished fundamentalism wages an uphill struggle, but its alleged damage to scientific truth is far less than its many detractors would have you believe. KENNETH A. BRIGGS, EASTON, PA.
