That is when lakes and rivers freeze into pavements of marbled blue ice. For a few months, trucks can haul fuel or lumber or diamonds or a moose carcass to the region\u2019s remote communities and mines that are cut off by water and wilderness, reachable for most of the year only by barge or by air. But Canada\u2019s ice roads \u2014 more than 3,300 miles of them \u2014 have been freezing later and melting earlier, drastically reducing the precious window of time that isolated residents rely on to restock a year\u2019s worth of vital supplies, or to simply take a road trip. Even in the depths of winter, increasingly frequent storms and thawing have made the roads more dangerous and sometimes too weak to use safely, prompting the authorities to close them for days at a time. \u201cIt\u2019s taking longer for everything to freeze up, and the ice isn\u2019t as thick,\u201d said Wally Schumann, the minister of infrastructure for the Northwest Territories. \u201cIce roads are the lifeline of our communities, and now they\u2019re at risk.\u201d The Canadian authorities say that climate change is causing an array of problems, from increased melting of sea ice to the thawing of permafrost in the Northwest Territories, which is warming four to five times as fast as the global average. Mr. Schumann said climate change was also to blame for the troubles with the ice roads, which are built anew each year by hardy crews using heavy-duty plows, radar and water sprays to add layers of smooth ice that can support even the weight of a tractor-trailer full of mining equipment. The roads are meant to last from January through April, but much of this year\u2019s network is already unusable. The Dettah Ice Road across Yellowknife Bay closed on April 7, about two weeks earlier than average. As the ice roads have become increasingly unreliable, pressure has grown for Canada to prepare for a future without them, by building all-season land roads \u2014 a time-consuming and expensive job, estimated at 600,000 Canadian dollars, or about $450,000 per mile, maintenance not included. \u201cA lot of people say we\u2019re out of time, we have to deal with this right now,\u201d Mr. Schumann said. For the people in the far north who wait anxiously each winter for the ice roads to reach their marooned communities, the crisis is becoming a matter of life and death. \u201cThese roads are the only way our people can survive,\u201d said Alvin Fiddler, grand chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents 49 indigenous communities in northern Ontario, including 32 that are isolated from Canada\u2019s highway network and electrical grid and depend on the winter road system to replenish stocks of fuel, food and building materials. Some of those communities nearly ran out of diesel fuel because an ice road opened several weeks late, Mr. Fiddler said. Each community needs about 264,000 gallons of fuel to keep the lights on all year, enough to fill 40 tanker trucks. Flying it in would cost an additional $520,000, a prohibitive amount for a small village. In the vast boreal forests and tundra of the Northwest Territories, the federal and territorial governments are spending about $225 million to build a 93-mile all-season highway to a small Inuit village on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, replacing an ice road. It is due to open in November, with several similar projects in the planning stages. But that still leaves 10 of the territory\u2019s remote communities dependent on winter roads and ice bridges across lakes, rivers and permafrost, delicate ground that has been frozen for thousands of years. Keeping those roads solid requires constant maintenance by crews with the fortitude to endure hours of toil in the arctic elements. On a recent visit to the territory, the temperature was minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit and falling as our truck drove smoothly across Marian Lake, 21 miles of snow-covered frozen water. The stretch is part of the 285-mile Tlicho Winter Road, which links remote communities to Yellowknife, the territorial capital. Michael Conway, who supervises ice-road crews in the North Slave region, turned off the truck, got out and brushed aside some snow to reveal more than three feet of gleaming ice beneath. In the almost extraterrestrial silence of arctic winter, a deep pop could be heard below, like the bursting of a distant balloon. A few seconds later came a crackling sound like a candy-bar wrapper being crushed. \u201cIce is like a living thing,\u201d Mr. Conway said. \u201cIt breathes.\u201d A generation ago, he said, the lake would naturally freeze thick enough for crews to drive a plow across it without concern. But in recent years, the warmer autumns and deeper snow, which acts as an insulator, have made for much thinner natural lake ice, making road construction a cautious slog and delaying openings to traffic. To ensure that the roads are safe, road crews now use ground-penetrating radar to check the ice\u2019s exact thickness. When it is too thin, they bore a hole for a hose and then spray torrents of lake water out over the surface to freeze and build up additional layers of ice. Mr. Conway said that even those precautions were not always enough. \u201cA guy parked on the ice overnight,\u201d he said, \u201cand when he came back in the morning, his truck was gone.\u201d About 30 miles ahead, deep in the forest, white ptarmigan birds watched as a crew built up the winter road over spongy permafrost for a path toward Whati, an indigenous community of 500 people. Clint Westergard, 59, was one of the luckier men, cozy in the heated cab of a snowplow equipped with tracks for use in subzero weather. He has been building winter roads for 30 years, work that takes him and his crew away from home and into the frigid wilderness for weeks, sleeping in work camps between shifts. \u201cSome people can\u2019t handle the isolation,\u201d he said over the roar of the machine. They will not have to work on the road to Whati much longer. Late openings and frequent closures (the road was shut for the season on April 8) have prompted the territory to plan a 58-mile two-lane gravel road to replace it, at a cost of about $113 million. Yet even permanent roads are not immune to the shifting climate. On the region\u2019s main highway back to Yellowknife, entire guardrails have sunk into the roadbed, and a ribbon of asphalt that was once entirely flat now swells and dips because of thawing permafrost. With a harrowing winter coming to an end, ice-road truckers are wondering how many more years they will be able to stay above water. \u201cThis has been one of most difficult and challenging seasons we\u2019ve ever faced,\u201d said Mark Kohaykewych, president of Polar Industries, whose fleet of 42 trucks hauls freight across northern Manitoba, Ontario and Alberta. About three-quarters of those journeys are on winter roads, he said. Mr. Kohaykewych has been in the ice-road trucking business for eight years, but only in the last two has he had to divert winter cargoes to airports because of unseasonable weather. Freak rainstorms made several ice roads unusable for a while in February, he said, and he spent the first weekend in April rescuing a stranded trucker\u2019s rig that had broken through lake ice. But at least the truckers can drive away. \u201cThe communities are the ones really suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout ice roads, how will they fix homes or build schools? You can\u2019t fly in a bulldozer.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/world/canada/ice-roads-ease-isolation-in-canadas-north-but-theyre-melting-too-soon.html", "section": "World", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "The country\u2019s 3,300 miles of ice roads are a lifeline for marooned communities during frigid winters, but climate change is making the roads unsafe much earlier.", "title": "Ice Roads Ease Isolation in Canada\u2019s North, but They\u2019re Melting Too Soon", "published_date": "2017-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-19T11:31:00-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "item_type": "Article"}
