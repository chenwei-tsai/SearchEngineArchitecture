Trump, will test whether audiences will spend a half-hour with a satirical commander in chief.", "section": "Arts", "text": "Though he is new to the job of hosting a late-night show, Anthony Atamanuik has already begun stocking his office with creature comforts: an Xbox, a Nespresso machine, bottles of bourbon. His favorite perk, however, may be the wooden lectern where he dictates monologues as President Trump, the character he plays on \u201cThe President Show,\u201d a new weekly Comedy Central program that makes its debut on Thursday. \u201cI feel most comfortable when I\u2019m standing there,\u201d Mr. Atamanuik said. \u201cI rewrite in his voice.\u201d On Wednesday morning, Mr. Atamanuik, 42, a gregarious improvisational comedian, was in this setting at the Midtown Manhattan offices of \u201cThe President Show,\u201d revising a script with some of his staff members. The theme of this unaired test show was mothers, particularly Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with his mother, Mary (who recurred throughout the show as a testy disembodied voice only he can hear). For the show\u2019s closing segment, Mr. Atamanuik imagined a homage to \u201cPsycho,\u201d where his Trump character would sit silently, wearing his mother\u2019s wig and shawl, while her disapproving voice berated him in his mind. Jason Ross, one of his executive producers, wasn\u2019t certain the scene would get big laughs. \u201cThere are no hard jokes,\u201d said Mr. Ross, a \u201cDaily Show\u201d alumnus. \u201cIt\u2019ll be quiet all the way through.\u201d Imbued, perhaps, with the spirit of the man he imitates for a living, Mr. Atamanuik pushed back. \u201cI might be totally wrong,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I just made an impassioned case for it. Tell me why I\u2019m wrong.\u201d \u201cThe President Show,\u201d which will follow Trevor Noah\u2019s \u201cDaily Show\u201d on Thursdays, is an unusual offering, even for Comedy Central, the ancestral home of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Its premise is that Mr. Trump is the host of his own late-night program, where he delivers his opening monologue as if it were a news conference, and interviews guests from the Oval Office while bantering with his sidekick, Vice President Mike Pence (played by Peter Grosz of \u201cVeep\u201d). While many other late-night programs have their own recurring Trump impressionists \u2014 Alec Baldwin on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d; Jimmy Fallon on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe President Show\u201d will test whether audiences want to spend a whole half-hour with a satirical deconstruction of the commander in chief. It is also a momentous opportunity for Mr. Atamanuik, a veteran of the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater who has appeared on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cBroad City\u201d but has never starred in or been at the creative heart of his own TV series. \u201cWhatever it yields, and you have no control over it, I\u2019m happy that this happened now for me,\u201d Mr. Atamanuik said, trying to stay sanguine. But, he added: \u201cI\u2019ve worked a lot of jobs. I\u2019ve been a restaurant manager before. That\u2019s where I\u2019m taking my boss skills from.\u201d Mr. Atamanuik, who grew up in Chelsea, Mass., has a personal Trump side that is not hard to tap into. He walks the halls of his offices (previously home to \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d and \u201cThe Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore\u201d) humming \u201cHail to the Chief.\u201d He can be a bit of a name-dropper; a bit highhanded; a bit discursive \u2014 none of which Mr. Atamanuik denies. Asked how he approached playing Mr. Trump, he referred to the \u201cJungian shadow,\u201d which he described as \u201cthe part of me that I don\u2019t want the world to see, but that I\u2019m showing all the time.\u201d \u201cI want to have a relationship with that shadow, and understand it, as opposed to rejecting it,\u201d he explained. Mr. Atamanuik also compared himself to Dustin Hoffman\u2019s character in \u201cTootsie.\u201d \u201cI was an out-of-work actor who couldn\u2019t get hired as himself,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I put on a red wig and now I\u2019m on TV.\u201d Mr. Atamanuik started playing Mr. Trump at improv shows in August 2015, soon after Mr. Trump declared himself a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. \u201cI just thought, it\u2019ll be funny,\u201d Mr. Atamanuik said. \u201cWho\u2019s the least likely person?\u201d But as Mr. Trump\u2019s political stock rose, Mr. Atamanuik was offered more and more places to play him: a one-man show, \u201cTrump Dump\u201d; a satirical series of mock debates, \u201cTrump vs. Bernie,\u201d with the comedian James Adomian as Senator Bernie Sanders; on the Comedy Central game show \u201c@midnight.\u201d Kent Alterman, the Comedy Central president, said he felt Mr. Atamanuik\u2019s Trump impression \u201ctranscends mimicry\u201d and the premise of his show would allow it to go beyond knee-jerk criticism of America\u2019s chief executive. \u201cHe\u2019s not just interested in preaching to the converted,\u201d Mr. Alterman said. \u201cI think he\u2019s really interested in taking the character out in the world and mingling with all kinds of people.\u201d Comedy Central is in an experimental mode with its late-night programming. The network is trying out new shows and formats, including a coming series hosted by the Australian comedian Jim Jefferies, and a \u201cDaily Show\u201d spinoff with Jordan Klepper scheduled for the fall. However, the network has not hesitated to cancel programs it feels are not working, like Mr. Wilmore\u2019s \u201cNightly Show,\u201d which ended in August. Asked whether any Trump impression, no matter how multifaceted, was enough to be the basis of an entire series, Mr. Alterman said, \u201cThat\u2019s something that we can only learn as we go.\u201d \u201cIf it becomes stale,\u201d he said, \u201cobviously, it\u2019s not going to be able to sustain for a long time. But there\u2019s a certain topicality and a sense of urgency that feels very compelling right now.\u201d Mr. Atamanuik has helped outfit \u201cThe President Show\u201d with friends from the Upright Citizens Brigade and accomplished comedy writers and performers like Mr. Grosz, who is also one of the show\u2019s executive producers; Christine Nangle (\u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d); and Emmy Blotnick (\u201c@midnight\u201d). Their job, in part, Mr. Atamanuik said, is to teach him what ideas work in a television format. \u201cI have to have deference and respect to the fact that they\u2019ve been through the wringer in a way I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been living like a retiree for 10 years.\u201d After the hourlong makeup process needed to transform him into the Trump character, Mr. Atamanuik rehearsed several \u201cPresident Show\u201d segments in a studio lit by deliberately tacky chandeliers. Before an audience of the program\u2019s writers and producers, Mr. Atamanuik delivered his mom-centered opening remarks (\u201cI put her in one of my great apartment complexes,\u201d he said in a familiar, adenoidal voice. \u201cI call it my mother complex, and it still exists to this day\u201d), and a played a scene, inspired by \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood,\u201d in which Mr. Trump visits the puppet-filled Land of Fake-Believe. He also got to perform his closing monologue more or less as he\u2019d envisioned it, in black and white, wearing a wig and shawl, grinning a Norman Bates grin, while the voice of his mother says he \u201cwouldn\u2019t even harm a fly.\u201d When that scene got the laughter that Mr. Atamanuik had hoped for, he proudly stormed off the stage with mock imperiousness. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a discussion,\u201d he jokingly declared. \u201cIt\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d"}
