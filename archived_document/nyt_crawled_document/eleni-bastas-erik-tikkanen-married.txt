{"text": "Eleni Bastas and Erik Matti Tikkanen were married April 28 in New York by the Rev. Dr. Athanasios L. Demos, a Greek Orthodox priest, at St. Eleftherios Greek Orthodox Church, of which he is the pastor. The bride, 36, is the senior director of loyalty marketing at the Leading Hotels of the World, a consortium of over 375 luxury hotels, in New York. She graduated cum laude from N.Y.U. and received an M.B.A. from the executive program at Columbia. She is the daughter of Ermioni Bastas and Stamatios Bastas of Norwood, N.J. The groom, 33, is an associate at Reiss & Preuss, a law firm in New York. He graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and received his law degree from the University of California Hastings College of the Law. He is a son of Mirel A. Tikkanen of San Francisco and Wayne R. Tikkanen of South Pasadena, Calif., and a stepson of Linda Ye. The couple met in 2014 when he was standing in front of her and a friend in a very long coat-check line after attending separate Valentine\u2019s Day parties at the Gansevoort Hotel in New York. A man and two women tried to cut in line in front of Mr. Tikkanen, and that angered Ms. Bastas. The line-cutting man pointed to the two women with him and said, \u201cThese two are drunk, they need to go home.\u201d Ms. Bastas had a ready reply: \u201cBefore Erik could say anything, I pointed to myself and him and said, \u2018We need to go home.\u2019\u201d That apparently sent the would-be line-cutters back to their rightful places at the back of the line. She and Mr. Tikkanen then struck up a conversation, and exchanged business cards. Then Ms. Bastas\u2019s friend, who had left their spot in line to ostensibly find the source of their long wait, returned, holding her and Ms. Bastas\u2019s coats. She had apparently decided to cut in line herself. Ms. Bastas apologized profusely to Mr. Tikkanen for her friend\u2019s breach, but he just laughed it off. \u201cI thought she was attractive and intelligent,\u201d he said of Ms. Bastas. He soon emailed her and asked if she would like to accompany him to the Cloisters in Upper Manhattan to see an exhibition of stained glass from Canterbury, England. After she accepted, he realized that the stained-glass exhibition would not open for another two weeks, so he asked her out for drinks and live jazz. \u201cWe planned our second date even before our first one,\u201d she said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/fashion/weddings/eleni-bastas-erik-tikkanen-married.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T09:00:03-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T09:00:03-04:00", "abstract": "The couple met in a very long, and tumultuous, coat-check line in New York.", "title": "No Cutting in Line (Present Company Excluded)"}
