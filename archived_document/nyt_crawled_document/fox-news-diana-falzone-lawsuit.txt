{"text": "Fox News faced a fresh legal challenge on Monday after Diana Falzone, a former contributor, accused the network of discriminating against her on the basis of her gender and her fight against a chronic disease. Ms. Falzone, who appeared regularly on Fox News and helped host several shows on the network\u2018s website, claimed in a suit filed on Monday in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan that she had been banned from further appearances after writing an op-ed column for Fox News disclosing that she had endometriosis and was likely to be infertile. The suit claims that Ms. Falzone had approval from her supervisors to write the column, which ran with the headline \u201cWomen Should Never Suffer in Silence.\u201d According to the lawsuit, her supervisor, Refet Kaplan, told her shortly after the piece ran that executives at the network had banned her from appearing on the air on Fox News or its website, the suit says. The filing did not elaborate on why she believed the column led to her being banned. \u201cThe issues raised in Diana Falzone\u2019s lawsuit are a concern for all women,\u201d said Nancy Erika Smith, a lawyer for Ms. Falzone, in a statement. \u201cFox News never banned her male counterparts who have discussed their personal health issues on air. Indeed, those men saw their careers advance.\u201d Ms. Falzone\u2019s claim is the latest of many the network has faced since its former chief, Roger Ailes, was forced out last summer after being accused by at least six women of inappropriate behavior. Last month, Bill O\u2019Reilly, the network\u2019s most popular host, was pushed out after The New York Times revealed that five women had been paid about $13 million to settle harassment claims. Mr. Ailes and Mr. O\u2019Reilly both deny the allegations against them. Last week, 11 current and former employees filed a class-action lawsuit against the network accusing it of racial discrimination. A spokeswoman for the network did not immediately reply to a request for comment.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/business/media/fox-news-diana-falzone-lawsuit.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T13:22:58-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T13:22:58-04:00", "abstract": "The contributor said she was banned from more work after disclosing her health issues in an op-ed column for the network\u2019s website.", "title": "Diana Falzone of Fox News Files Discrimination Lawsuit"}
