{"text": "Natalie Cole, a buoyantly jazzy singer who became a million-selling, Grammy Award-winning pop hitmaker with her 1975 debut album and went on to even greater popularity when she followed the example of her father, Nat King Cole, in interpreting pre-rock pop standards, died on Thursday in Los Angeles. She was 65. The cause was \u201congoing health issues,\u201d her family said. Ms. Cole had undergone a kidney transplant in 2009 and had suffered from other ailments recently, forcing the cancellation of tour dates in November and December. Ms. Cole had a light, supple, perpetually optimistic voice, full of syncopated turns and airborne swoops, drawing on both the nuances of jazz singing and the dynamics of gospel. It brought her million-selling albums in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as she moved from the sound of her own generation to that of her parents. \u201cThe biggest similarities between Ms. Cole and her father are in attitude. Instead of working toward catharsis, they aspire to a genteel elegance, balance and good feeling,\u201d Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times in 1993. \u201cBut where the ultimate direction of the father\u2019s singing was an easy chair on a moonlit porch, his daughter\u2019s tenser, more brittle singing evokes an urban, indoor setting. To the decorous phrasing of a big band singer she brings a steady current of soul-music sassiness.\u201d Ms. Cole was equally at home in the pop-soul of her No. 1 1975 hit, \u201cThis Will Be (An Everlasting Love),\u201d and in her technology-assisted duet with her father in 1991, based on his 1951 recording of \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d Both songs brought her Grammy Awards. The \u201cUnforgettable...With Love\u201d album, on which Ms. Cole sang her father\u2019s hits, also swept the top Grammy Awards \u2014 including album, record and song of the year \u2014 and sold seven million copies in the United States alone. Yet over a long career, Ms. Cole recorded broad selections of material, including Tin Pan Alley staples, songs written for her and songs by, among others, Fiona Apple and Bruce Springsteen. Her most recent album, in 2013, was \u201cNatalie Cole en Espa\u00f1ol,\u201d a collection of Latin pop favorites that was nominated for Latin Grammy Awards. Ms. Cole repeatedly overcame personal setbacks. Her first run of success in the 1970s was followed by struggles with heroin, alcohol and crack cocaine addiction in the early 1980s, a period she wrote about in her 2000 autobiography, \u201cAngel on My Shoulder.\u201d (She played herself in \u201cLivin\u2019 for Love: The Natalie Cole Story,\u201d a TV movie based on the book.) She went through rehab in 1983. \u201cI just can\u2019t have fun with drugs the way some people can,\u201d she told The Los Angeles Times in 1985. \u201cThey can get high or have a drink and go home. I\u2019m not like that.\u201d In 2009, as a result of hepatitis C that she believed she had contracted through past intravenous drug use, she underwent chemotherapy and a kidney transplant. Her 2010 book, \u201cLove Brought Me Back,\u201d chronicled the search for a donor. But she continued to perform well into 2015. Natalie Cole was born on Feb. 6, 1950, to Nat Cole and his wife, Maria Cole, who had sung with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. Natalie grew up surrounded by music and celebrities, and she made her recording debut as a child, singing with her father on a Christmas album. But after Nat Cole\u2019s death in 1965, she turned away from music. She majored in child psychology and graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 1972. But she was soon singing in clubs \u2014 although she resisted singing her father\u2019s material. \u201cI had to do my own songs in my own way,\u201d she told Rolling Stone in 1977. She was noticed by producers based in Chicago, Chuck Jackson and Marvin Yancy, who wrote much of her early material. She married Mr. Yancy in 1976, the first of three marriages. Ms. Cole is survived by her son, Robert Yancy, and her two sisters, Timolin Cole and Casey Cole. Capitol Records, which was also Nat Cole\u2019s label, signed Natalie Cole and released, in 1975, her debut album, \u201cInseparable,\u201d which drew comparisons to Aretha Franklin. She was named Best New Artist at the 1976 Grammy Awards, where \u201cThis Will Be\u201d also won as \u201cBest R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\u201d Ms. Cole\u2019s third album, \u201cUnpredictable\u201d in 1977, was also a Top 10 pop album. She showed off her acrobatic live vocals on \u201cNatalie Live\u201d in 1978 and made a duet album, \u201cWe\u2019re the Best of Friends,\u201d with the R&B crooner Peabo Bryson in 1979. But her pop profile dwindled, in part because of her drug problems. Her career was revived in 1987, after rehab, with \u201cEverlasting,\u201d which included three Top 10 pop singles: \u201cJump Start,\u201d the ballad \u201cI Live for Your Love\u201d and her version of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cPink Cadillac.\u201d Yet it was with \u201cUnforgettable...With Love\u201d in 1991, leaping back to a previous generation\u2019s songs, that Ms. Cole would establish her latter-day career. \u201cUnforgettable\u201d reminded both radio programmers and the record business that there was a large audience for music offering comfort far from the cutting edge. \u201cThe shock of it all is that this record is getting airplay,\u201d Ms. Cole said in an interview at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely shocking to see it between Van Halen and Skid Row on the charts, totally out of its element. It should be encouraging to record companies and my contemporaries.\u201d Yet the Grammy sweep for \u201cUnforgettable\u201d in 1992 drew some criticism, particularly as the Song of the Year was four decades old. In 1993, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences changed the Song of the Year rules to make songs eligible only in the first year they were recorded or rose to prominence. But Ms. Cole\u2019s new direction continued to yield both hits and awards. Her 1993 album, \u201cTake a Look\u201d and a 1994 Christmas album, \u201cHolly & Ivy,\u201d both sold half a million copies; \u201cStardust,\u201d another collection of standards in 1996, eventually sold a million copies and brought her a Grammy for another duet with her father, \u201cWhen I Fall in Love.\u201d Her 2008 album, \u201cStill Unforgettable,\u201d was named Best Traditional Pop Album. Ms. Cole also did some acting, appearing in television series including \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d Ms. Cole grew further into her family\u2019s heritage. In the late 1990s she performed with her uncle, the jazz singer Freddie Cole. And the virtual duets with her father continued through \u201cNatalie Cole en Espa\u00f1ol.\u201d His own \u201cCole Espa\u00f1ol\u201d album was released in 1958.) \u201cHe would step out on faith to do something musically,\u201d she told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d in 2013. \u201cHe would just take that risk, and that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve gotten from him, I guess. He was never trendy.\u201d", "published_date": "2015-12-31T19:00:00-05:00", "abstract": "Ms. Cole was a Grammy winner whose biggest hit was \u201cUnforgettable,\u201d a virtual duet with her father, Nat King Cole, that topped the 1991 charts.", "updated_date": "2017-04-26T03:00:09-04:00", "section": "Arts", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "title": "Natalie Cole, \u2018Unforgettable\u2019 Voice and Million-Selling Hitmaker, Dies at 65", "item_type": "Article", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/02/arts/music/natalie-cole-grammy-award-winning-singer-dies-at-65.html", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-26T03:00:09-04:00"}
