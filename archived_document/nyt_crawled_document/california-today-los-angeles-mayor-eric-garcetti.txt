(Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Today\u2019s introduction comes from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles. LOS ANGELES \u2014 After coasting to re-election with 81 percent of the vote in March, Mayor Eric Garcetti has been the subject of much chatter \u2014 will he run for governor or try to become a United States senator? Will he emerge as a national leader in the Democratic fight against the Trump administration? There were a few clues in the mayor\u2019s State of the City address Thursday morning. Mr. Garcetti said he planned to focus on the continued troubles over homelessness here and promised to stick to the Paris agreement on climate change even if the White House does not. (Though he did not explain how the city could do so without federal support.) Los Angeles, he said, is \u201ca vision of what America is reaching for tomorrow.\u201d \u201cWhen others try to pull us apart, we pull together,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile others are obsessed with the most powerful person in our country, we are empowering the most vulnerable in our own backyard.\u201d Some highlights from the speech: Homelessness \u201cAs mayor, there\u2019s no issue I spend more time on \u2014 because I believe that homelessness is the moral issue of our time.\u201d The mayor said that thanks to Measure H, which voters approved in November, the city will have $55 million a year to expand mental health and substance abuse programs and triple the number of supportive housing units in the next two years. Housing \u201cAnyone who writes a check at the beginning of the month knows that the rent in this city is just too high. Too many people are getting priced out.\u201d Hundreds of thousands of people in the city spend more than half their income on rent or live in severely overcrowded housing, the mayor said. Allowing more homeowners to build in their backyards and making it easier to build affordable housing would ease the burden, and he urged council members to approve a new fee for developers. Immigration \u201cIn Los Angeles, every city facility, service and program is available to every resident \u2014 regardless of their citizenship or immigration status.\u201d Emphasizing that the Los Angeles Police Department would \u201cnever act as a federal immigration force,\u201d Mr. Garcetti spoke briefly in Spanish saying that officers are on the streets to serve and that nobody should be afraid to report a crime.

[Opinion | Los Angeles Times] On Saturday, a swimming pool full of rainbow sprinkles will open in Los Angeles \u2014 at last. After a popular run in New York last summer, the pop-up Museum of Ice Cream has moved into an arts district warehouse, where it will celebrate all things milk, cream and sugar for the next five weeks. The museum created 10 \u201creimagined\u201d installations, including a melted Popsicle jungle, a walk of fame \u2014 featuring \u201cVanilla Ice\u201d of course \u2014 and a live mint \u201cgrow house.\u201d The project is the brainchild of Maryellis Bunn, a design strategist, and her boyfriend, Manish Vora, a former investment banker. Asked why they chose Los Angeles, Mr. Vora said it was a natural choice. \u201cIf you look at the epicenters of ice cream innovation, you\u2019re seeing that happening in Los Angeles,\u201d he said, citing the city\u2019s artisanal creameries such as Salt & Straw. The museum is arguably as much a celebration of Instagram culture as ice cream. The Willy Wonka-like backdrops at the New York installation became a major selfie attraction. (Mr. Vora said visitors comprised a \u201cheavy millennial set.\u201d) A flavor of commercialism is also hard to ignore. American Express and Dove Chocolate are among the sponsors. A gift shop sells mini cone earrings ($8), sprinkle socks ($14) and a pink Ping-Pong table ($10,500). Thankfully, real ice cream is included in the ticket price ($29 for adults and $18 for children and seniors). California creameries will be on hand with a rotating \u201cscoop of the week.\u201d The museum runs from April 22 to May 29. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.
