{"text": "The Commerce Department on Friday provided its first statistical snapshot of the American economy in the first quarter, the gross domestic product estimate. \u2022 The economy barely grew, expanding at an annual rate of only 0.7 percent. \u2022 The growth was a sharp decline from the 2.1 percent annual rate recorded in the final quarter of last year. It was the weakest quarterly showing in three years. The first-quarter performance upset expectations for a Trump bump at the start of 2017. The economy\u2019s weakness reflected new caution among consumers. Other sectors like housing and business investment turned in a stronger showing, but not enough to offset factors like weaker retail sales. Most experts believe the economy is picking up speed now, with Wall Street looking for growth at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter. But initial hopes have been repeatedly proven too rosy lately \u2014 just two months ago, economists predicted that first-quarter growth would be roughly 2 percent. Friday\u2019s estimate, which will be revised twice in the coming months as more information comes in, underscores a growing debate over what data best captures economic activity. Indicators referred to as \u201csoft data\u201d \u2014 surveys of corporate investment plans as well as consumer and business sentiment \u2014 have all risen since President Trump\u2019s victory in November. And just this week, the president\u2019s blueprint for big tax cuts for business and individuals helped fuel a renewed rally on Wall Street. But actual economic activity \u2014 retail sales, inventory accumulation, automobile purchases \u2014 has not caught up with rising expectations, at least not yet. Indeed, if the weakness persists, it could provide ammunition to the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill who favor big tax cuts, since that could stimulate growth in the short term, at the risk of much higher deficits. \u201cReconciling improved consumer confidence with modest levels of consumption is an exercise that will occupy us for the rest of the year,\u201d said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, in an interview before the G.D.P. estimate\u2019s release. \u201cI know there will be a school of thought that blames it on residual seasonality,\u201d he said, referring to the winter doldrums that also reduced growth in the first three months of 2016, 2014, 2011 and 2010. \u201cBut I have to be honest: The hard data just wasn\u2019t very good last quarter.\u201d \u201cThe retail retreat, especially in autos, was greater than many people anticipated,\u201d he said. Why would the first quarter appear weaker than expected year after year, when the government adjusts for seasonal factors like a rise in retail sales before Christmas, or a slowdown in construction in January and February? One partial explanation is that warm winters have reduced energy spending and generation at utilities. Another is that government statisticians were having trouble compensating for sets of data that are more volatile than others, like government spending and imports and exports. \u201cThese indicators tend to be lumpy, but they are never lumpy in the same way, so it\u2019s tough to predict,\u201d Mr. Tannenbaum said.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/business/economy/economy-gross-domestic-product-first-quarter.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T08:31:50-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T08:31:50-04:00", "abstract": "The Commerce Department\u2019s initial estimate of the gross domestic product showed a sluggish start for the year, with consumers hesitant to spend.", "title": "U.S. Economy Grew at 0.7% Rate in First Quarter"}
