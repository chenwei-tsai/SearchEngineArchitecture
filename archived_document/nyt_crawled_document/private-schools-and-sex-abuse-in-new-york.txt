{"text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cEx-Headmasters Step Aside After Choate Abuse Report\u201d (news article, April 29): While I applaud the continued coverage of the child sexual abuse scandal at Choate Rosemary Hall, I am perplexed that attention is not being drawn to the fact that in New York State, private school administrators do not have to make a report to the law enforcement authorities if a child is sexually abused by a teacher, a staff member or a volunteer. A bill (A. 5371/S. 4342) that would ensure that these protections for the 475,000 children attending private schools, and one that my agency helped write, has been passed by the Senate Children and Families Committee but has stalled in the Education Committee in the Assembly. It is dumbfounding that there is a double standard of reporting child sexual abuse. Children in private schools must have the same protections as children in the public schools. Let\u2019s not read about another scandal; let\u2019s take action to prevent it! MARY L.
