{"section": "Business Day", "text": "Federal and state regulators unleashed a flood of lawsuits and enforcement orders on Thursday against the Ocwen Financial Corporation, one of the nation\u2019s largest mortgage servicers, aimed at curbing what they said had been years of flagrant and repeated abuses, including illegal foreclosures, deceptive fees and extensive mishandling of customers\u2019 home-loan payments. Twenty state mortgage regulators filed cease-and-desist orders intended to limit or freeze Ocwen\u2019s ability to acquire new mortgage loans to service in their states. Servicing a loan involves billing customers and funneling payments to the lender; Ocwen, which is not a bank, specializes in doing so for subprime mortgages \u2014 home loans issued to people with less-than-stellar credit. The company is failing at some of its most basic duties, the state regulators said, and needs to be stopped. Also on Thursday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Florida\u2019s attorney general filed lawsuits accusing Ocwen of making sloppy mistakes at nearly every stage of the collections process, inflicting frustration and millions of dollars in added costs on borrowers trying to pay their home loans. Ocwen denied the accusations and called the consumer agency\u2019s allegations \u201cinaccurate and unfounded.\u201d This is Ocwen\u2019s second major run-in with the consumer bureau. In 2013, the company agreed to pay $2.1 billion to settle a similar set of charges. At the time, the company pledged to reform, but instead it has \u201ccontinued to fall down on the job for borrowers,\u201d said Cara Petersen, a lawyer at the consumer bureau. More than 580,000 customers have complained to Ocwen about errors in the last two years, according to the consumer bureau. Ocwen, which collects payments from 1.4 million borrowers on mortgage debt of more than $200 billion, said it had just received the state regulators\u2019 orders and would review them. It said it intended to fight the consumer bureau\u2019s lawsuit and called it \u201can unfortunate example of overreaching.\u201d \u201cOcwen strongly disputes the C.F.P.B.\u2019s claim that Ocwen\u2019s mortgage loan servicing practices have caused substantial consumer harm,\u201d Ocwen said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cIn fact, just the opposite is true. Ocwen believes its mortgage loan servicing practices have and continue to result in substantial benefits to consumers above and beyond other mortgage servicers.\u201d", "item_type": "Article", "abstract": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and mortgage regulators from 20 states have moved to limit the operations of Ocwen Financial, which has a history of regulatory problems.", "created_date": "2017-04-20T15:30:19-04:00", "title": "Subprime Mortgage Servicer Is Accused of Years of Abuses", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-19T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/business/dealbook/subprime-mortgage-servicer-is-accused-of-years-of-abuses.html", "updated_date": "2017-04-20T15:31:08-04:00"}
