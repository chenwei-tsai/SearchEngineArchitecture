{"text": "MARGARET THATCHER A Life and Legacy By David Cannadine 162 pp. Oxford University, $14.95. So much has been said about Margaret Thatcher that the only thing left to do is to say less. Cannadine\u2019s life of the strident and indomitable prime minister is quick as a sprint and a joy to read. Initially prepared as an entry for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Cannadine\u2019s Thatcher appears here in a stand-alone volume of 162 lively pages. In them the author, a prolific biographer and historian, synthesizes decades of scholarship on the most significant figure in British politics since Winston Churchill. \u201cMargaret Thatcher: A Life and Legacy\u201d necessarily forgoes detailed chronology for broad strokes. There was the middlebrow upbringing in a provincial English town; the unlikely rise to prime minister (\u201cAs in Grantham, Margaret was again living over the shop\u201d); war with the cabinet and the trade unions; solidarity with the United States; conservatism; femininity; glamour; strength; and a brusque and commanding style that put Britain\u2019s patriarchy in its place. Thatcher\u2019s hectoring manner also meant an idle retirement: \u201cThere was no possibility of another high-level job, because she had offended too many people and was rightly regarded as an impossible colleague.\u201d Cannadine persuasively concludes that Thatcher rivaled Churchill in stature but not achievement. Her convictions and force of personality gave rise to their own movement (Thatcherism), yet her signal foreign policy success was an anachronistic colonial adventure in the Falklands. She helped win the Cold War but was \u201cemphatically on the wrong side of history\u201d in favoring apartheid South Africa and opposing German reunification. Domestically, Thatcher presided over years of unemployment and economic policies that coddled the rich. Yet, like Ronald Reagan, she fundamentally reoriented her country\u2019s politics. Ferocious and bold, Thatcher is a case study as much in willpower as sharpness of tooth. PILLARS OF JUSTICE Lawyers and the Liberal Tradition By Owen Fiss 209 pp. Harvard University, $27.95 In \u201cPillars of Justice,\u201d Fiss, an eminent constitutional scholar, offers a warm and generous reflection on the men and women who shaped his life in the law. The book collects brief essays on 13 judges, attorneys and law professors who provided inspiration and friendship. The common theme is a reverence for legal liberalism in its various forms: Yale Law School, where Fiss taught for many years; the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division, where he began his career after clerking for Justice William Brennan; the \u201chalcyon days of the Warren court\u201d; and Brown v. Board of Education, which Fiss views as the Supreme Court\u2019s key triumph and promise. The book contains as much autobiography as portraiture, and it begins with an arresting anecdote. Traveling to Washington, D.C., as a high school student, Fiss visited the court to observe his first oral argument. Who should he see at the lectern but Thurgood Marshall himself, arguing Brown. Marshall is one of three judges profiled here, along with Brennan and the Israeli jurist Aharon Barak. John Doar and Burke Marshall represent the practical idealism of the 1960s Justice Department. In 1963, Doar gained fame by helping to quell a brewing riot in Mississippi after the assassination of Medgar Evers. A photo of that tense moment appears on the book\u2019s cover. Fiss\u2019s entries on his fellow scholars, by contrast, can unfortunately veer into small-stakes law school politics, or worse, arcane theories and stale hypotheticals that have little application outside Yale\u2019s lofty walls. Much is made of the clever titles of law review articles. And somewhere between Fiss\u2019s account of \u201cfundamentality without fundamentalism\u201d and the well-worn \u201cticking time-bomb\u201d scenario to discuss torture, many readers will find their attention wandering. The early chapters of this book are best. GEORGE WASHINGTON The Wonder of the Age By John Rhodehamel 353 pp. Yale University, $32.50. This biography of the nation\u2019s first president stands out for its rich prose. Rhodehamel writes of Washington\u2019s \u201clegendary courage and his splendid person,\u201d and explains that he possessed \u201cthat rare and inexplicable power to make others trust and obey him. Many discovered that they actually loved him.\u201d Rhodehamel\u2019s jaunty writing makes for a highly entertaining book. Here he is on the Continental Army\u2019s surprise attack at the Battle of Trenton: \u201cThe Americans charged aggressively, emerging out of the swirling snow. Washington led from the center.\u201d The general\u2019s instinct to find the middle of the action worried his men. It also inspired them. Washington\u2019s story benefits from a vigorous telling. The powdered wig, the silly pants, the poker face staring out from crumpled dollar bills: All serve to separate us from our founding father. Rhodehamel\u2019s urgency of prose restores the connection. He also showcases his experience as the former archivist of Mount Vernon by bringing manuscript sources directly to the reader. A fine detail is Washington\u2019s distinctive penmanship. \u201cHe learned to write in an imposing hand that is still lovely to see. His lines lay perfectly straight across the paper. He liked elegant capital letters.\u201d Rhodehamel contends that a tension between ambition and reluctance to serve produced Washington\u2019s greatness. He eagerly sought out commands early in his career, but he hesitated to assume the presidency and could not wait to be free of it. In office, he used his tremendous prestige to consolidate American nationhood at an uncertain moment. Washington was not perfect: He freed his slaves in his will but had been a lifelong slaveholder; and while he decried partisanship, he himself became a fierce Federalist. Yet even flawed, Washington was both the projection and embodiment of the citizenry\u2019s deepest aspirations.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/books/review/3-books-tell-the-legacies-of-legends.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Books", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T17:00:16-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T17:00:16-04:00", "abstract": "A Shortlist that looks at major figures from our time and before.", "title": "3 Books Tell the Legacies of Legends"}
