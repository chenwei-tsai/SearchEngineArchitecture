Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Theresa May, the British prime minister, is betting a snap election in seven weeks will strengthen the Conservative Party\u2019s hold over Parliament and secure an electoral mandate of her own. The odds are in her favor, as the Tories are leading by 17 percent over the Labour Party, according to a BBC analysis of recent polls. But polls have been wrong before, and it won\u2019t help that she broke with her oft-repeated vow not to call an election before 2020. Here\u2019s a video and transcript of her speech. _____ \u2022 Worries about terrorism have returned to the forefront of France\u2019s presidential election after the arrest of two men in Marseille on suspicion of preparing an attack to disrupt campaigning. Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, is planning a rally in the southern city this evening. Here\u2019s a look at how the five leading candidates compare. _____ \u2022 Hungary, which already had one of the toughest immigration policies in the European Union, has rolled out a draconian asylum procedure that will reduce applicants to a trickle and essentially put them in prison camps for months while their cases are decided. By next month, several hundred asylum seekers already in Hungary may also be sent to the detention camps. The muted condemnation by the rest of the E.U. is a measure of just how much the winds have shifted in favor of populist, far-right policies across the bloc in a year filled with important elections. _____ \u2022 As President Trump nears 100 days in the White House, he has drifted away from some of the anti-establishment ideas that animated his populist campaign. His promise to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris climate deal may also be at risk. Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency faced an early referendum as a Democrat was leading in the race for a congressional seat in Georgia long held by Republicans. _____ \u2022 And remember last week when the White House ordered an American aircraft carrier into the Sea of Japan to send a powerful deterrent signal to North Korea? It just came to light that the carrier was actually sailing in the opposite direction. But it is now heading to the Sea of Japan and should arrive sometime next week. _____ \u2022 Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion brand continues to look abroad despite the ethical complications of her White House job. China and Japan recently approved her trademarks, and dozens more are pending around the world. \u2022 The International Monetary Fund raised its global growth outlook to 3.5 percent this year, partly because of increased international trade. \u2022 In parts of the U.S., beer sales suffered after marijuana was legalized. But winemakers say their product and cannabis complement each other. \u2022 Our tech expert advises against buying the new Samsung Galaxy S8 anytime soon. \u2022  Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Turkey detained at least 49 people protesting the outcome of Sunday\u2019s referendum to expand the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as videos stoke accusations of voting fraud in polling stations across the country. [Hurriyet] \u2022 In Egypt, gunmen attacked a checkpoint near the iconic St. Catherine\u2019s Monastery, one of the world\u2019s oldest Christian monasteries, killing one police officer. [The New York Times] \u2022 The American man who killed a passer-by while posting the attack live on Facebook fatally shot himself as the police in Pennsylvania closed in on him, the authorities said. [The New York Times] \u2022 A group of human rights advisers have urged the United Nations to compensate hundreds of ethnic Roma poisoned by lead waste in decrepit camps run by its peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. [The New York Times] \u2022 And our Interpreter columnist looks at why the most common way for a democracy to collapse is not through a coup or revolution, but by the actions of an elected incumbent. \u2022 Here\u2019s a reminder that improving your health and fitness doesn\u2019t take much time \u2014 four minutes, in fact, is enough. \u2022 Trouble sleeping? Try replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Skip the sad pasta salad and try one that is packed with roasted eggplant, chile and mint. \u2022 Leicester City\u2019s fairy-tale Champions League journey came to an end when it was held to a 1-1 draw by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the quarterfinals. Real Madrid beat Bayern Munich, 4-2. Today, Barcelona will have to overcome a 3-0 first-leg loss against Juventus. \u2022 Once-graceful village homes across France are being stripped for their architectural elements. Antique tile floors, wood paneling and sometimes even whole staircases end up overseas. \u2022 Last year, Maureen Chiquet was abruptly fired as the global chief executive of Chanel. We visited her to discuss how she has since reinvented her life and is now trying to turn her experience into a teachable moment. \u2022 And Steve Martin, the comedian, takes a rare, retrospective dive into his stand-up career to find lessons on how to be funny. When the New England Patriots visit the White House today to celebrate the team\u2019s Super Bowl victory, several players will be missing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\u201d said LeGarrette Blount, above right. The missing players won\u2019t be the first to decline a White House visit. The Patriots\u2019 Tom Brady skipped the last time the team won the Super Bowl, in 2015, citing a family commitment. Larry Bird didn\u2019t show when the Boston Celtics visited the Reagan White House in 1984. \u201cIf the president wants to see me, he knows where to find me,\u201d Mr. Bird said. The tradition of sports teams visiting the White House dates from at least 1865, when President Andrew Johnson welcomed two amateur baseball teams. The first championship team believed to have visited didn\u2019t have to travel very far: the Washington Senators, after winning the 1924 World Series. Even Canadian teams have visited. After the Toronto Blue Jays won the 1992 World Series, President George Bush invited the team. \u201cAmerica is proud of you,\u201d he told the team\u2019s manager.
