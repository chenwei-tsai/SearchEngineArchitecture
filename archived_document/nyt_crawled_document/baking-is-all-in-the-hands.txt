I think the closest she ever came to baking was spearing bright orange peanut-shaped marshmallows on a carving fork and toasting them over the stove. When I married \u2014 I was 19 and a college junior \u2014 the only culinary experience I could claim was burning down my parents\u2019 kitchen seven years earlier, a misadventure involving frozen fries and boiling oil. Marriage (and a budget constrained by student loans) made me a cook; my mother-in-law inadvertently made me a baker. She was a funny, spirited woman who was guarded, cool and singularly unsentimental, except when she talked about her parents, both bakers by trade. Her expression would soften as she remembered the warm cinnamon buns that waited for her after school. Watching her mime the motions of spreading sweet butter on a freshly baked poppy-seed roll \u2014 every bit of the roll\u2019s surface had to be covered \u2014 was like hearing her declare: My family loved me! Could baking really do that? If it could, I wanted to bake. The galvanizing experience, the one that sent me into the kitchen, occurred the evening I dropped by my mother-in-law\u2019s house in Brooklyn. I found her whistling and making knishes, those potato pies I\u2019d have sworn only machines could produce. I barely had time to take off my coat before she pushed the dough toward me. \u201cTouch it,\u201d she said, \u201cFeel how silky it is \u2014 this is how it should feel.\u201d I\u2019d never touched dough before then, or even seen anyone bake. But something about my mother-in-law\u2019s almost childish delight in what she had made, and the way she looked at me when she placed the dough in my hands, stayed with me. She gave me the recipe, and on the way home, I bought flour. I found a little counter space in our made-for-gnomes kitchen and set to work. The last instructions my mother-in-law gave me were my mantra: If the dough is dry, add more oil; if it\u2019s wet, add more flour. And so I added more oil and added more flour and added more and more until I had a mountain of dough that was as rough as a horse blanket. I went to bed knishless. Had I been more experienced, more attuned to the language of baking, I might have understood that everything I needed to know about that dough was in my hands. Had I held more dough, I would have known to cup my hands around it, to rub my thumbs against the surface, heft the ball, sink my fingers into it, tug at it to discover if it stretched, if it sprang back, if it was airy or tight. But my hands didn\u2019t know enough then. Today they\u2019re my trustiest tool. I lift pie crust from the counter on my palms, fit it into the pan and then flute the edges with my fingers. I shape bread dough into loaves by hand. Using every part of my hands, I coax a thin sponge cake into a jelly roll (and there isn\u2019t a time when I don\u2019t take a moment to admire the chubby spiral I\u2019ve crafted). Crescent cookies are formed with my fingers, not perfectly, not evenly, but with pleasure \u2014 a pleasure similar to the one I feel when I twist puff pastry into long curlicues or pleat it to make elephant-ear cookies. Baking is handwork, and for me, all that is joyful, comforting, gratifying and even magical about this work is packed into the simple act of making biscuits. I practice a kind of mediation while I make them. I concentrate on how each step feels \u2014 not so much because it makes a better biscuit (which it does) or because it\u2019s more satisfying (which it is), but because I like having my senses on high alert, anticipating and responding to the dough\u2019s changes. With apron on and sleeves rolled high (biscuits are a messy business), I dig my hands into the flour and butter and mash, squeeze, smoosh and press the ingredients together, watching the cold butter jump from my fingers at first and then feeling it yield as it warms and softens and I fall into the rhythm of it. I love how the dough is lumpy, how I find chunks of butter here, shards there, and how the higgledy-piggledy mixture teeters toward hopelessness until I reach into the bowl again to knead and fold it. And when, under my hands, the misshapen nuggets become the dough they\u2019re meant to be, I\u2019m still always surprised. By the time I pry open the baked biscuits, cover them with strawberries \u2014 some gently cooked into jam, some fresh and glistening with sugar \u2014 and top it all with whipped cream, my handprints are baked into them. So are a large measure of joy and a small pinch of hope: Maybe what I\u2019ve baked will linger in someone\u2019s memory; and maybe, just maybe, it will make a new baker.
