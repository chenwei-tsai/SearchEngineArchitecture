{"text": "Those seeking a primer on how to start a gallery could look to Bridget Donahue. Having opened on the Bowery just two years ago, she is \u2014 by any estimation \u2014 going gangbusters. Two of her artists are in the current Whitney Biennial: Jessi Reaves, who makes furniture sculptures (functional chairs, tables and sofas) out of foam, plywood, sawdust, plexiglass and auto parts, as well as Susan Cianciolo, a former fashion designer who for the biennial created a pop-up Japanese-inspired tearoom, serving lunch to the installation\u2019s visitors for a few days at the Whitney\u2019s restaurant Untitled. But Ms. Donahue can go on at length about any one of the seven artists she represents \u2014 how Mark Van Yetter recently had a show at Kunsthall Stavanger in Norway, for example, or how she is traveling to Cologne, Germany, with Martine Syms, who is having a solo show there. \u201cMy little exploding stars,\u201d Ms. Donahue said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of them.\u201d Ms. Donahue didn\u2019t always want to be in the art world; she considered becoming a journalist, then an anthropologist, since she was studying textiles and economics. Work with textiles led her to the art of Rosemarie Trockel, which in turn led Ms. Donahue to answer a want ad for a job at the Gladstone Gallery, which represents that artist. From there, she went to D\u2019Amelio Terras in Chelsea and then to Gavin Brown, as a director. She took on her first artist, Lynn Hershman Leeson, after hearing her speak about \u201c!Women Art Revolution,\u201d a 2010 documentary. \u201cCurators and others had known about Lynn,\u201d Ms. Donahue said, \u201cbut the whole next generation did not know about her.\u201d Ms. Donahue\u2019s shows have been well received. \u201cThe kind of visual and tactile magic that makes you remember why you loved art in the first place \u2014 way back, as a kid \u2014 is hard to find,\u201d Holland Cotter wrote in The New York Times in 2015. \u201cBut it\u2019s there in Susan Cianciolo\u2019s enchanting solo exhibition, her first New York gallery show in over a decade.\u201d In a telephone interview, Ms. Cianciolo praised Ms. Donahue\u2019s openness. \u201cThere are so many levels of anarchy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut incredible professionalism.\u201d While her gallery\u2019s success has exploded, her staff has not \u2014 it\u2019s still just Ms. Donahue and her associate, Erin Somerville. If anything, Ms. Donahue needs to think about pacing herself. \u201cSome of these milestones came so quick,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/design/my-little-exploding-stars-bridget-donahue-calls-her-artists.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T16:54:02-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T16:54:02-04:00", "abstract": "After just two years on the Bowery, a gallerist who struck out on her own has had one success after another.", "title": "\u2018My Little Exploding Stars,\u2019 Bridget Donahue Calls Her Artists"}
