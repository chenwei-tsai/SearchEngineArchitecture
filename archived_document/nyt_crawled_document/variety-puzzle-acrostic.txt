{"text": "VARIETY PUZZLE \u2014 In another lifetime, I was a canine behaviorist and I helped people understand their dogs\u2019 behavior so the dogs and their humans could live peacefully together. By and large, most of the real behavioral \u201cissues\u201d that came up turned out to be from people who owned terriers. That\u2019s not a slight to terriers; I have lived with a few myself, and I think they\u2019re a hoot. It\u2019s more of a misunderstanding between terriers and the people who would like them to be nice, obedient golden retrievers. Terriers are way smarter than people, but if you don\u2019t give them a job, they will decide on their own what job they should have, which might not always be in the owner\u2019s best interests. Terriers also happen to be excellent trainers of people. One day, I got a call from a man who was frustrated because his terrier kept locking him out of his house. The man was a smoker, and his family had expressed displeasure that he had been unsuccessful thus far in quitting the habit. Dogs pick up on the emotions that people express, and this terrier observed that there was a problem to be solved with her people. Challenge accepted. The man had been relegated by his family to the outside deck at the back of his house to smoke, and every time he would pull the door closed behind him and light up, this dog would trigger the floor lock and lock him out. The dog knew that she had provoked the right response by the man\u2019s angry and eventually deflated body language. Plus, it was wonderful entertainment for this dog. When the man was good and tired of this behavior, he called me for a phone consultation. I told him that he clearly had two options: Quit smoking or procure a screwdriver. The latter was a better option, he said, but what was the screwdriver for? The screwdriver was to remove the screws from the floor lock, I said. Problem solved, although I still believe that the dog had the man\u2019s best interests at heart. Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon offer us a relevant acrostic quote today by Stephen BUDIANSKY, who wrote the book \u201cTHE TRUTH ABOUT DOGS.\u201d Not moving when a human approaches is a dog\u2019s way of bucking for a promotion, behaviorally speaking. A leader in a dog pack does not move for lower-ranking dogs. The lower-ranking dogs move around the leader. My gimmes this week were Eug\u00e8ne IONESCO, the YEOMEN Beefeaters and the SHELTIE. I couldn\u2019t remember UNIVAC because my brain kept insisting it was ENIAC, but I eventually worked it out. I loved the wordplay in \u201cBeef in a kosher deli?\u201d for KVETCH and learned that HAMBONE is a rhythm technique that uses the body as a percussion instrument.
