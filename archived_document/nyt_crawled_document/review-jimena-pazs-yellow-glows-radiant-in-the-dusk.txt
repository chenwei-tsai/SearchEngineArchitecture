In the middle of an enigmatic solo, performed largely in silence in the intimate confines of the Chocolate Factory, it\u2019s unsettling when the dancer shrieks like a horror movie victim. The second and third screams are less jolting, folded in with calmer activities, but they still stick out among the mysteries of Jimena Paz\u2019s \u201cYellow,\u201d such as: Why does the performance take place two hours before sunset? There are clues. A brief program note introduces the idea of \u201cforeignness\u201d and, as source material, a dance that Ms. Paz learned in 1991 from the Argentine choreographer Iris Scaccheri. Each performance, the note says, \u201cwill end when the sun sets in Buenos Aires.\u201d Ms. Paz was born and raised there, but for the past two decades she has danced in New York, a standout in works by the likes of Vicky Shick (who, with Ralph Lemon, collaborated with Ms. Paz on the choreography for \u201cYellow\u201d). She isn\u2019t foreign to downtown dancegoers, though aspects of \u201cYellow,\u201d like those Expressionist screams, might be. The late-afternoon setting heightens the impression of a dancer in a studio, trying to piece something together from memory. The dancing comes in bits: walking, rolling, casually posing, shaking. Agitated, Ms. Paz takes a cigarette break. She puts on and removes a dress of tulle; she strips off orange pants to uncover green ones underneath, but she doesn\u2019t reveal much else. A story she tells in Spanish she whispers into the floor. A section of tendril-like arms and difficult balances might be the work of Ms. Scaccheri, who died in 2014, celebrated in her home country and unknown here. Ms. Paz appears to hold invisible castanets. Writing about Ms. Scaccheri in 2015, Ms. Paz described her as \u201cmy dance ghost,\u201d an artist whose daily practice honored the beauty of a dancer at work. Ms. Paz is the kind of performer whose beauty increases with the intensity of her focus. As she goes deeper into the dance, she draws you in. Whatever the hidden meanings of \u201cYellow,\u201d that effect is its magic: the flush and radiance of Ms. Paz growing as daylight fades in a city far away.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/arts/dance/review-jimena-pazs-yellow-glows-radiant-in-the-dusk.html", "published_date": "2017-04-24T20:00:00-04:00", "created_date": "2017-04-25T16:21:34-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "title": "Review: Jimena Paz\u2019s \u2018Yellow\u2019 Glows Radiant in the Dusk", "item_type": "Article"}
