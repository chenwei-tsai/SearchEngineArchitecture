{"section": "Opinion", "text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cFox News Ousts O\u2019Reilly, a Host Central to Its Rise\u201d (front page, April 20): So Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure is supposed to show a company changing its culture? The letter that Fox sent to its staff announcing that Mr. O\u2019Reilly would step down in the face of mounting sexual harassment charges sure spent a lot of time praising him. It declared him \u201cone of the most accomplished TV personalities in the history of cable news,\u201d and if that weren\u2019t enough went on to say that \u201chis success by any measure is indisputable.\u201d How in the world does heaping praise on this departing sexual harasser honor the women whose careers he damaged? How does it begin to foster \u201ca work environment built on the values of trust and respect\u201d? How does it stand up for women in the workplace? Far from showing a change for the better, the letter Fox sent to its staff confirms that the sickness at Fox starts with those at the top. These same people covered up Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behavior \u2014 and so put countless other women at risk \u2014 by paying out hush money to those who came forward, while doing nothing to solve the problem itself. Business. As. Usual. KATH JONES, NEW YORK To the Editor: So, when women complain about Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s harassment, some get confidential settlements \u2026 and his contract is renewed. When advertisers complain, he is ousted. We can applaud the appropriateness of having consequences for inappropriate behavior, but the dynamic begs a harder look. M.B. BARLOW, EUGENE, ORE. To the Editor: Over the course of the past year, there have been more and more allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct at Fox News. The same network that preaches traditional, conservative values appears to have a culture that is the very antithesis of what its personalities preach. At a time when the viewing public seems to be losing trust in news media and is attentive to perceived \u201cfake news,\u201d it\u2019s unsettling to see Fox personalities so carelessly negate their branded identity. What\u2019s more fake than that? BRENDAN KUDZY, FAIRFIELD, CONN. To the Editor: What is sad about this news is that allegations of sexual harassment can get a television host fired in America, yet it cannot stop the election of a president! Have the standards for the office of the president fallen lower than those for a television host? GURMEET S.
