Ms. Coulter, in a message to The New York Times, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for free speech.\u201d Despite insisting that she would go to Berkeley regardless \u2014 even after the university said it could not accommodate her on the date and time it had initially scheduled her \u2014 Ms. Coulter suggested she would call off the appearance. The school said she could only speak at a later date and an earlier time of day, when there were likely to be fewer students on campus and less of a likelihood for violent outbreaks. Late Tuesday, the conservative group that was helping Ms. Coulter in her legal efforts to force Berkeley to host her, Young America\u2019s Foundation, said they could no longer participate. \u201cYoung America\u2019s Foundation will not jeopardize the safety of its staff or students,\u201d the group said. Without any support, Ms. Coulter said she could not go forward. \u201cEveryone who should believe in free speech fought against it or ran away,\u201d she said.", "created_date": "2017-04-26T11:22:36-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "abstract": "Ms. Coulter, in a message to The New York Times, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for free speech.\u201d", "item_type": "Article"}
