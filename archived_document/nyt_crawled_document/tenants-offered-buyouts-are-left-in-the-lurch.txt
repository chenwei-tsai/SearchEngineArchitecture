{"text": "The tale of the lease buyout is almost mythical in New York. It goes something like this: A tenant with the good fortune of a rent-regulated apartment in a hot neighborhood negotiates a six- or even seven-figure payout in exchange for the keys. On the surface, a buyout may look like a sweetheart deal for a tenant. But tenant advocates say the reality is often dark, with landlords preying on vulnerable tenants and bullying people into leaving their homes for paltry sums. Even under the darkest circumstances, though, plenty of landlords still cut the checks. But what happens if they don\u2019t? On Jan. 31 of this year, Machiveni Tigrai moved out of his rent-regulated, $1,720-a-month one-bedroom apartment in the East Village, expecting to receive a $260,000 buyout. He piled his belongings into a U-Haul and handed in the keys. But his landlord did not give him the money. Instead, when he called, he just got voice mail and silence. So Mr. Tigrai, 37, who works in technology, slept in his U-Haul in the middle of winter, afraid to leave his belongings unattended. As the days wore on, he became increasingly anxious. He did not want to sign a lease on a new apartment until he had the check in hand, and he did not want to pay for storage. So he stayed with the truck, some nights sleeping on friends\u2019 couches. \u201cYou\u2019re always kind of anxious with a deal of this magnitude,\u201d he said. As it turned out, Mr. Tigrai had good reason to worry. His landlord, Raphael Toledano, failed to pay 15 tenants their promised buyouts as his fledgling real estate empire, Brookhill Properties, faltered. \u201cHe pulled the rug out from under them,\u201d said SaMi Chester, a housing organizer at Cooper Square Committee, an advocacy group that represents tenants in properties Mr. Toledano owns in the East Village. Over the last three years, Mr. Toledano, 27, acquired around 30 Manhattan rental properties and a notorious reputation. He bought a portfolio of 15 buildings, including Mr. Tigrai\u2019s building on East 12th Street, from the Tabak family for $97 million in 2015. He financed the deal with a $124 million loan from Madison Realty Capital, a real estate investor, planning to use the extra money for buyouts and renovations. What followed was a familiar playbook: Coerce tenants to give up their valuable rent-regulated apartments with threats of eviction or offers of cash payouts, or both. Once the tenants leave, renovate the empty spaces and lease them for considerably more money. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a part of the business plan,\u201d Mr. Toledano said in a telephone interview. But that business plan became a nightmare for some of his tenants. Last year, tenants in a building Mr. Toledano owns on East 13th Street settled a harassment suit against him after they secretly recorded his agent making threatening statements. Mr. Tigrai said that to persuade him, Mr. Toledano called him six or seven times a day, from different numbers, a violation of a city tenant harassment law. \u201cHe made it really clear that he was going to make it a miserable place to live,\u201d said Jen Bekman, 47, an entrepreneur who lives in another Toledano-owned building, on East Fifth Street. She also fielded daily calls and texts from the landlord. \u201cSometimes he\u2019d lose his temper. You could just tell that he was kind of volatile.\u201d The clock was ticking for Mr. Toledano. His deal with Madison Realty Capital gave him a year to clear out apartments, then renovate and rent them. \u201cHe really came in with the idea that he was going to be able to empty out that whole portfolio and people were going to roll over,\u201d Mr. Chester, the housing advocate, said. As time went on, the buyout offers grew. In June 2016, Ms. Bekman, who had lived in her $1,900-a-month one-bedroom apartment for 25 years, signed a deal for $600,000, the largest payout any of the tenants were offered. In all, 140 of the 300 tenants who lived in the 15 buildings signed buyout agreements, totaling $7 million in payouts, Mr. Toledano said. By last spring, Mr. Tigrai, who had lived in his apartment for almost a decade, was worried a window would close. \u201cI felt like this guy is throwing a lot of money around,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the last guy to take the deal.\u201d But by the time Mr. Tigrai and Ms. Bekman signed agreements to give up their apartments, Mr. Toledano was unable to pay his debts. To shield himself from personal liability, Mr. Toledano had purchased each of his properties using limited liability companies. Last summer, the L.L.C.s that owned the buildings in the Madison Realty portfolio went into default and Madison stopped funding the buyouts. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to renovate the properties as quickly as he expected,\u201d said Brian Shatz, a managing principal of Madison Realty. He \u201cwasn\u2019t able to implement the business plan.\u201d In early February of this year, just days after Mr. Tigrai moved out, Madison Realty filed for foreclosure on the properties. About two weeks later, Mr. Tigrai received an email from Brookhill Properties: The company did not have the money to pay him. Realizing that he had lost his home and anticipated nest egg, Mr. Tigrai hired a lawyer, James B. Fishman. \u201cI think what happened here is pretty outrageous,\u201d Mr. Fishman said. On March 6, a judge ordered Mr. Tigrai back into his apartment, restoring his lease until the case is resolved. He came back to an apartment that still had stains on the ceiling from years of water damage. A few days after he moved back in, he discovered large holes that had been cut in the wood floors without warning. The management told him it had needed to access pipes to repair leaks in another apartment, he said. Ms. Bekman, meanwhile, received $50,000 after she signed her buyout. But the next $100,000 installment never arrived, so she stopped packing, and is still living in her apartment. She no longer pays rent, in keeping with the terms of the deal with Mr. Toledano. \u201cI have a free apartment in New York; I\u2019m living in one of these folklore tales,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m moving in 30 days for more than a year now.\u201d Ms. Bekman worries that she might never get the rest of her money, and might lose the apartment, too. \u201cI have nerves of steel,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is scary.\u201d Mr. Chester said that Mr. Toledano\u2019s tactics were no different from those of other landlords hoping to make a quick profit. But being able to return to an apartment in light of a failed buyout usually happens only when the tenant has \u201cgood legal representation and good organizing.\u201d Even Madison Realty, which decided to lend a huge sum to a young, inexperienced landlord, does not see Mr. Toledano as an outlier. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to tell you that Raphael Toledano destroyed this portfolio or mismanaged it completely,\u201d Mr. Shatz said, \u201cthere are a lot of other landlords that are at this level that are operating and running buildings exactly like this.\u201d Mr. Toledano insisted that he never intended to violate the agreements of tenants. \u201cAre they upset, are they frustrated?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I can understand. I\u2019m a businessman, I do business deals, very large ones. I feel their pain. I\u2019m sincerely apologetic. It was ultimately a result of something much larger than I was able to handle.\u201d In late March, the L.L.C.s that owned the properties filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, halting the foreclosure. At an April 14 hearing, a judge gave Madison Realty\u2019s management company, Silverstone Property Group, the temporary authority to operate the properties, to collect rent and make repairs. \u201cNow the tenants will have some clarity about who their management is,\u201d said Mr. Shatz of Madison Realty. For the 15 tenants waiting for their buyout payments, the future is uncertain. Mr. Shatz was circumspect, saying, \u201cOur general intention is to honor those obligations.\u201d Mr. Toledano, meanwhile, has been selling off other East Village properties and said he was in contract with an investor to buy a $200 million portfolio of properties in the West Village, a neighborhood where he said tenants were less organized. \u201cI kind of want to get out of the East Village walk-up business, to be honest,\u201d he said, without a hint of remorse. \u201cThere is so much scrutiny of the buyouts.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/realestate/tenants-offered-buyouts-are-left-in-the-lurch.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Real Estate", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:14-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:14-04:00", "abstract": "Promised lucrative payments to give up their rent-regulated apartments, 15 East Village residents were paid in part, or not at all.", "title": "Tenants Offered Buyouts Are Left in the Lurch"}
