{"section": "Opinion", "text": "To the Editor: Re \u201cPlan Would Limit Protections for Immigrants Held in Jails\u201d (front page, April 14): I saw firsthand the horrific conditions under which immigrants are detained when I volunteered as a pro bono lawyer in November 2015 and December 2016 with the CARA Pro Bono Project at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Tex. The center is a privately owned immigration detention center for women and children under contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Unlike detainees in the criminal justice system, immigrants detained by ICE are not entitled to a lawyer and often do not speak English. Without volunteer lawyers, the women and children detained would have no legal representation, and there would be no one on the ground fighting to hold ICE accountable to the existing subpar regulations. The conditions there were devastating. It was common to feel a child\u2019s lungs rattle because he was so sick, and it was common to hear that he was barely receiving any medical attention. Stripping away the minimal regulations that exist for detained immigrants is not only appalling but also inhumane.
