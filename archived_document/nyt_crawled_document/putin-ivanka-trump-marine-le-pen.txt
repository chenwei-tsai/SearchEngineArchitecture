{"text": "Good morning.  Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 An American missile-defense system intended to counter threats from North Korea is now operational in South Korea, where it has electrified the country\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 partly over questions of who will pay for it. The system, called Thaad, went live a day after President Trump declared his willingness to meet with North Korea\u2019s dictator. Hillary Clinton, in a television interview, mocked the suggestion as impulsive and na\u00efve. _____ \u2022 President Trump spoke with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by phone in the leaders\u2019 first chat since relations deteriorated over the U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base last month. Mr. Putin also spoke with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who made a rare visit to Russia. Relations between the two countries have been fraught since Russia seized Crimea in 2014. Ms. Merkel said she talked to Mr. Putin about human rights issues, a noted departure from their continuing differences over Ukraine and Syria. _____ \u2022 The United States needs \u201ca good \u2018shutdown\u201d of the government this fall in order to force a partisan fight over federal spending, President Trump said in posts on Twitter. The posts indicate the degree to which bipartisan negotiations in Congress have bedeviled Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. But on health care, it was a Republican who dealt a huge blow to the new bill this week. Ivanka Trump wants to be a moderating force in the White House, she told us. She also plans to review executive orders. Here\u2019s a look at her West Wing agenda. _____ \u2022 China has built up enormous holdings in poor, resource-rich African countries, but its business partners there aren\u2019t always thrilled. Few countries have been affected more strongly than Namibia. Our magazine examines China\u2019s reach in the nation, where no-strings financing, infrastructure projects and historical solidarity are hard to resist. But for some Namibians, the flood of Chinese loans and investments looks like a new form of colonialism. _____ \u2022 Australian goods have become hot commodities in China. Thousands of young Chinese who are students at Australian universities or recent graduates have built a cottage industry to meet that demand. One former student says she makes more than $300,000 a year. She is 25 years old. _____ \u2022 And a harrowing tale in the Himalayas.  Rescuers in Nepal located a young Taiwanese trekker who had been lost for more than six weeks. His girlfriend had died three days before he was rescued. The man who found them said he had spotted what he assumed were two bodies on a ledge. When he reached them, he was shocked when one of them began speaking. _____ \u2022 Infosys, an India-based outsourcing company, said it would hire 10,000 workers in the U.S. in the next two year. \u2022 In Europe\u2019s election season, computer scientists and tech giants are using algorithms and online data to spot fake news faster than traditional fact-checkers can. \u2022 Sydney is getting a second international airport after more than 70 years of discussions. \u2022 The United Airlines chief executive apologized to an outraged congressional panel over the recent episode in which a man was dragged off a plane. \u2022 U.S. stocks were higher. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Venezuela\u2019s opposition supporters blocked streets in Caracas and denounced President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s move to create a group charged with rewriting the country\u2019s constitution. Critics say it\u2019s an attempt to avoid elections. [Reuters] \u2022 An Australian man was detained in New York after overstaying his visa by 90 minutes, according to his family. [ABC Australia] \u2022 Marine Le Pen, the far-right presidential candidate in France, was accused of plagiarizing from a former opponent\u2019s speech. [The New York Times] \u2022 British tabloids on \u201cBrexit.\u201d Despite falling circulations and tarnished reputations, tabloids remain powerful supporters of the country\u2019s exit from the European Union. [The New York Times] \u2022 In Indonesia, the youth wing of Nahdlatul Ulama, the largest mass Islamic organization in the world, started a global initiative to bring Islamic law, or Shariah, into line with 21st-century norms.

[The Asahi Shimbun] \u2022 Even as China\u2019s conservation efforts gain support, millions of new consumers want to purchase animal-based concoctions.

[The New Yorker] \u2022 In a first, SpaceX delivered a U.S. spy satellite into space for the Department of Defense.

You may be in the minority. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Gather spring vegetables and cook a lovely pesto soup. \u2022 Cats do like people. Given a choice among human affection, toys and food in a recent study, the cats sometimes chose people. \u2022 Machines will soon be able to smell when you\u2019re sick. \u201cMy estimate is it\u2019s a three- to five-year time frame\u201d before such tools are available, one biomedical engineer said. \u2022 From the Opinion pages, our Vietnam \u201967 series continues: Literature about the Vietnam War and its aftermath by Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans is plentiful and good. Too few Americans read it. On this day almost 40 years ago, Gary Thuerk, a marketer for Digital Equipment Corporation, sent a message advertising new VAX systems to over 400 users of the Arpanet, the precursor to the internet. Spam was born. Complaints about the unsolicited email came in almost immediately. \u201cThis was a clear and flagrant abuse of the directory!\u201d wrote one of the recipients. One Arpanet user, Richard M. Stallman, who did not receive Mr. Thuerk\u2019s message, claimed he would not have minded receiving it. Then one of the recipients shared it with him. \u201cI eat my words,\u201d Mr. Stallman wrote. \u201cI sure would have minded it!\u201d Mr. Thuerk has since been dubbed the \u201cfather of spam,\u201d though he prefers another moniker. \u201cI think of myself as the father of e-marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference.\u201d In 2012, two academics estimated that spammers earned about $200 million annually, which was dwarfed by the $20 billion spent in the U.S. to fight it. These days Mr. Thuerk draws mixed reviews when people discover his past. \u201dPeople either say, \u2018Wow! You sent the first spam!\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cOr they act like I gave them cooties.\u201d Evan Gershkovich contributed reporting. _____ This briefing was prepared for the Australian morning.
