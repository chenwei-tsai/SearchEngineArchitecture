{"text": "When I was 12, shortly after I joined a youth-basketball team, my father summoned me to the living room. He was holding a set of VHS tapes called \u201cPistol Pete\u2019s Homework Basketball,\u201d which he thought might help me get ready for the coming season. Naturally, I was dubious. In what sense could basketball be considered homework? And who was Pistol Pete Maravich anyway? With the solemnity that other fathers adopt when passing down heirloom rifles, Dad handed me the tapes and said, \u201cJust watch.\u201d I popped the first one into the VCR, but Maravich\u2019s appearance did little to curb my skepticism. Gawky and bird-thin, he wore a Chicago-cop mustache and spoke in the gentle exhortations of a youth pastor. \u201cPractice, practice, practice,\u201d he said, shaking a finger at the camera. \u201cRemember: Don\u2019t forget to do your homework.\u201d What I didn\u2019t know at the time was that Maravich was a legend; he set the scoring record in the N.C.A.A. and made five trips to the N.B.A. All-Star Game throughout the 1970s. But he was most famous for his on-court wizardry, for his nimble behind-the-back passes and persuasive head-fakes that made even the most adroit defenders look ornamental and weak. \u201cHomework Basketball,\u201d which was released in 1987, started with lessons on the fundamentals, like shooting and dribbling. But as the videos went on, Maravich began to initiate his young viewers into a more esoteric set of skills. \u201cI\u2019m also going to teach you today how to do the creative \u2014 the more advanced \u2014 type of pass, the artistic type of pass.\u201d The video then furnished a bevy of drills whose names sounded like dance moves that you would execute only at a wedding: \u201cDifferent Strokes,\u201d \u201cScrambled Eggs,\u201d \u201cThe Laid-Back.\u201d Alone in the penumbral glow of the gym, Maravich pirouetted across the hardwood, schooling invisible foes with breakneck sleights of hand. Again and again, I rewound the trick-shot sequence, watching as Maravich leapt into the air and looped the ball between his legs before completing a reverse layup. Throughout that basketball season, I rose before dawn to begin my regimen. In the gloom of the driveway, I followed the Pistol\u2019s workout, lassoing the ball between my legs (sometimes wearing a blindfold). Then I rehearsed behind-the-back passes, first with my right arm, then with my left, aiming for a bull\u2019s-eye I had painted on the wall of our garage. My efforts were downright monastic \u2014 asceticism in the service of its opposite. Yet whenever I applied Maravich\u2019s instructions to actual games, my coaches grimaced at the theatrics. Occasionally it would work out: I still recall faking a behind-the-back pass and juking my opponent, only to retract the ball and flip it against the backboard for an uncontested layup. But just as often my glitzy passes veered into the hands of waiting defenders. So enamored was I with the aesthetic possibilities of the sport, I overlooked the simple urgency of competition. Eventually, my flashiness earned me a spot on the bench and, once I got to high school, a berth on the J.V. squad. Now in my early 30s, I rarely play basketball anymore, fearful as I am of shredding an ankle or mangling a knee. These days, if Pistol Pete\u2019s videos remain \u201cinstructional\u201d for me, it\u2019s because they insist that glimmers of artistry can live, however briefly, in activities we might otherwise regard as brute and mechanistic. A friend of mine claims that he cannot watch sports because their simplistic teleology \u2014 putting a ball in a basket, lobbing a puck into a goal \u2014 distills \u201cthe futility of the whole human experience.\u201d Sports, for him, expose the extent to which all of us are obsessively zeroed in on the next mark, the next burst of glory, all of which will be swiftly and inexorably forgotten. But it\u2019s not the primal exigencies of winning that compel my attention. Rather, it\u2019s those moments when something unexpected, something artful, flashes out of the roil of bodies in space. On certain days, I\u2019ll jog past a public park where scrums of 20-somethings hotfoot across the concrete and will feel an odd twinge in the gut. One recent afternoon, I actually summoned the courage to join them. On a fast-break, something miraculous happened. I caught an outlet pass and, blazing across center court, I was momentarily overcome by the ghost of that boy \u2014 the kid toiling in his driveway \u2014 at which point I dished a no-look pass through a defender\u2019s legs and hit my teammate midstride, who finished things off with a balletic dunk. Heads turned. Teammates said, O.K., O.K.! This is what will be remembered, I thought, when the ground takes us back. The score will be forgotten, but what will endure are those rare moments when the plodding human body escaped its mortal form and entered, if only for a second, the realm of grace. At 40, not long after he released the videos, Pistol Pete Maravich died during a game of pickup basketball. Unknown to anyone, Maravich included, he was born with a rare heart defect that left him without a left coronary artery. Cardiologists who reviewed his autopsy were flummoxed that he managed to play basketball for so long. In light of this knowledge, I find it tempting to read retroactively into his career a kind of gorgeous desperation, to wonder whether, on some level, he felt the burden of his truncated fate, a questing urge to linger in the spotlight while it was still his.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-pistol-petes-homework-basketball.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Magazine", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:10-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:10-04:00", "abstract": "Released in 1987, the videos offer some rather esoteric lessons.", "title": "Letter of Recommendation: \u2018Pistol Pete\u2019s Homework Basketball\u2019"}
