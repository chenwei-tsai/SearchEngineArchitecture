{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans introduced a measure late Wednesday to keep the government open past Friday\u2019s deadline, giving themselves more time to finalize a spending bill. The stopgap legislation would continue government funding through May 5, averting a government shutdown this weekend. The measure still needs to be approved by the House and Senate. Lawmakers are working to finish up a spending package that would fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The longer term spending deal is expected to provide more funding for the military and for border security, although President Trump backed off his demand that lawmakers provide money to go toward the wall he wants to build along the border with Mexico. Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the short-term spending measure, known as a continuing resolution, would \u201ccontinue to keep the government open and operating as normal for the next several days.\u201d \u201cI am optimistic that a final funding package will be completed soon,\u201d Mr. Frelinghuysen said. \u201cIt is time that this essential work is completed so that critical programs and activities \u2014 including national defense \u2014 are properly and adequately funded for the year.\u201d Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d on a spending agreement covering the rest of the fiscal year. \u201cLet\u2019s pass this new continuing resolution,\u201d Mr. Cochran said, \u201cand make good use of this extra time to enact overdue legislation to provide for national defense and meet our country\u2019s needs.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/republicans-propose-short-term-funding-plan-to-avert-shutdown.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T09:00:29-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T09:00:29-04:00", "abstract": "The stopgap legislation would continue government funding through May 5, averting a government shutdown this weekend.", "title": "Republicans Propose Short-Term Funding Plan to Avert Shutdown"}
