{"text": "Jesse Green, the new co-chief theater critic for The New York Times, was the theater critic and a feature writer for New York magazine.  You can follow him on Twitter (@JesseKGreen) and Facebook (jesse.green.critic). Broadway is a bully in April, stealing attention, if not lunch money, from theater everywhere else in the city. But with the end of the bigfoot season on April 27 \u2014 the date by which productions must have opened to compete for this June\u2019s Tony Awards \u2014 it\u2019s once again safe for the smart, weird shows to come out and play. Aside from revivals of established masterworks, including the Sondheim-Weidman musical \u201cPacific Overtures,\u201d at Classic Stage Company, and Beckett\u2019s \u201cHappy Days,\u201d at Theater for a New Audience, May looks to be hospitable to a wide range of proudly oddball productions, Off Broadway and beyond. Here are five that I\u2019m especially looking forward to on my first day as the new co-chief theater critic here at The New York Times. Suzan-Lori Parks is making the most of her role as a playwright in residence at the Signature Theater. A revival of her \u201cThe Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World\u201d was a highlight of the fall; since then, she\u2019s frequently been found making music in the Signature\u2019s convivial lobby with her band, Sula and the Noise. Next up is a revival of this 1996 drama about Saartjie Baartman, an African woman \u201cof singular anatimy\u201d who was exhibited in 19th-century European freak shows as the \u201cHottentot Venus.\u201d (Zainab Jah, who played the warrior in \u201cEclipsed,\u201d stars as Baartman; Lear deBessonet directs.) For Ms. Parks, drama is tangible, starting with the skin; no wonder she calls her Signature year a process of \u201cresurrecting my body of work.\u201d Tickets: signaturetheatre.org In 1954 it apparently seemed like a profitable notion to reset the story of Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cOdyssey\u201d in Washington State, circa 1900, and turn it into a musical. The result was a three-month Broadway bomb. Still, over time, the delicious through-composed score by Jerome Moross and John LaTouche, along with Mr. LaTouche\u2019s clever book (Paris is a traveling salesman who runs off with Helen after an apple-pie-baking contest) turned the bomb into a cult. Who knows what this Encores! concert production, directed by Michael Berresse and starring Lindsay Mendez as Helen, and Ryan Silverman as Ulysses, may do for the show\u2019s reputation? In any case, the chance to hear the lush songs (including the standard \u201cLazy Afternoon\u201d) in their full orchestrations is probably, sadly, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Tickets: nycitycenter.org Rachel Dolezal notwithstanding, most people don\u2019t get to choose their race \u2014 or, therefore, what kind of racism they will experience or engender. That limitation on our power of perspective is temporarily corrected in this immersive production, conceived and written by James Scruggs, in which audience members, before entering a \u201cdystopian theme park\u201d called SupremacyLand, decide at the door what race they will be. (And no, you can\u2019t change your mind once you\u2019re in.) Incorporating large-scale video, text and music, the work (directed by Tamilla Woodard and Kareem Fahmy, at 3LD Art & Technology Center) may not be for the interactively squeamish, but perhaps that\u2019s part of the point. Tickets: 3ldnyc.org A built-in paradox of theater is that for all its immediacy in the playhouse, it can take forever to get there. That\u2019s just one reason that this new drama by Robert Schenkkan (\u201cThe Kentucky Cycle,\u201d \u201cAll The Way\u201d) is an outlier and potentially a tonic. Written in one week and in a \u201cwhite-hot fury,\u201d as Mr. Schenkkan told The Times, it is a speculative fiction, set in 2019, in which a journalist (Tamara Tunie) interviews a Trump administration official (James Badge Dale) who is awaiting sentencing for his role in deporting immigrants after a terrorist attack. Whether the speed of composition will prove to have served the drama remains to be seen, but the speed with which it is reaching audiences is already impressive. Aside from this New York production, directed by Ari Edelson at New World Stages, five theaters have taken it up or are scheduled to present it in the coming months. Tickets: buildingthewallplay.com Gina Gionfriddo, a Pulitzer Prize finalist for both \u201cBecky Shaw\u201d and \u201cRapture, Blister, Burn,\u201d has a scalding ear for satire. But there\u2019s also something classical about the way she sets up and complicates her premises; the apparently humble but actually rather conniving title character of \u201cBecky Shaw\u201d couldn\u2019t help invoking the similarly named Becky Sharp in Thackeray\u2019s \u201cVanity Fair.\u201d Likewise, her latest play, about a woman unable to choose what kind of life (and man) to make, may remind you of the 1864 Trollope novel with which it shares a title. Not a bad model. Amber Tamblyn, making her New York stage debut, stars, along with the Off Broadway familiars Darren Pettie, Frank Wood and Ella Dershowitz, under the direction of Peter DuBois at the Vineyard Theater.
