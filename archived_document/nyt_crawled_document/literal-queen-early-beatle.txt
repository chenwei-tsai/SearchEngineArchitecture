{"text": "MONDAY PUZZLE \u2014 It\u2019s Monday, or almost Monday if you solve the puzzle when it comes out online, and we\u2019re all sad that the weekend is over and that we have to go back to work. So we\u2019re going to start our solving week with a somewhat grisly theme by Ed Sessa, who seems particularly put out. It\u2019s the only explanation I can think of for doing what he does to poor Marie Antoinette in his puzzle. Of course, what happened to Marie Antoinette, the queen of France with her husband, Louis XVI, is a matter of history. While she never really said \u201cLET THEM EAT CAKE (20A),\u201d she was beheaded, and so the cry \u201cOFF WITH HER HEAD\u201d is indeed apt. The punch line, however, is at 41- and 47 Across. At 41A, we discover poor Marie without her head (the first letter of her name, rendered as ARIE ANTOINETTE) and we find out that she was at least accused of committing a CAPITAL OFFENSE ... as was Mr. Sessa, for leaving the letter off. \u25a0 24D: Not necessarily tricky, but I always want to spell Madalyn Murray O\u2019HAIR\u2019s name as O\u2019HARE. Here is the answer grid for today\u2019s puzzle. Here\u2019s hoping you have a better Tuesday, Mr. Sessa.
