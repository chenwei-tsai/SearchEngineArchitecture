Harold Bloom fell in love with Shakespeare\u2019s Sir John Falstaff when, as a boy of 12, \u201cI turned to him out of need, because I was lonely.\u201d That was 75 years ago; Bloom has been faithful ever since, and \u201cFalstaff: Give Me Life\u201d may be his last love letter to the shaping spirit of his imagination. Not that there is anything ethereal about Fat Jack. This whiskery swag-bellied omnivorous cornucopia of appetites, red-eyed, unbuttoned, sherry-soaked. This nightwalker and whoremonger, a \u201cmuddy conger,\u201d swinging at his old mistress Doll Tearsheet, a life-affirming liar whose truth is never to be a counterfeit. Falstaff is ancient energy thumping at volume through a temporary poundage of flesh. He is part pagan \u2014 the Lord of Misrule on the loose in Eastcheap, and as such his time is short. We meet him first in \u201cHenry IV, Part 1,\u201d already old, lusting at life, drinking pal of the young Prince Hal, who is calculatedly slumming it in London\u2019s East End, like any rich kid running away from the family firm. This book is an explanation and a reiteration of why Falstaff matters to Bloom, and why Falstaff is one of literature\u2019s vital forces. These two strands of argument cannot be separated. Bloom is not a thinker who tries to take himself out of the equation. As a teacher and a writer he has always wanted to make us feel something, as well as to understand something. Profoundly learned himself, his learning is a call to life \u2014 that we are, or can be, altered and enriched by what we know. Bloom calls Falstaff \u201cthe true and perfect image of life\u201d; this is the center of his argument. To follow his meaning the reader needs to be prepared to follow Shakespeare. This brief book is dense with quotation \u2014 but necessarily so. Falstaff: \u201cDost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit: Thou art essentially mad without seeming so.\u201d \u201cEssentially mad without seeming so\u201d \u2014 Shakespeare anticipated Freud by 300 years in recognizing how madness can be hidden behind ambition, success, money and especially the cold calculations of power. Shakespeare\u2019s message of madness is to be found in those characters who are anti-life \u2014 whether Angelo in \u201cMeasure for Measure,\u201d or Lady Macbeth, or Leontes in \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale.\u201d In the late plays there is a cure for madness: Lear dies sane, Leontes repents. But the dangerous, subversive question of the history plays \u2014 and in Bloom\u2019s book, we\u2019re reading both parts of \u201cHenry IV\u201d as well as \u201cHenry V\u201d \u2014 is, what is power worth? Falstaff, excessive, loving, outrageous, overblown, but true, stands against Hal\u2019s counterfeit. Prince Hal, morphing into Henry V, may be a great leader, but he dumps his friends, rewrites his past, and in carnage is a self-aggrandizing commander of the Death Star. Falstaff is on the side of life; messy, silly, unplanned, all for love, life. Shakespeare was a showman, and his Henry plays played to English jingoism and mythmaking. They look as if they\u2019re about nation building, kingship and pride in warfare. But Falstaff is the comic counterpoint to all that posturing. In a wonderfully comic scene, cited at length by Bloom, Falstaff will play dead like a circus dog in order to avoid being killed in Hal\u2019s war. Falstaff: \u201cTo die is to be a counterfeit, for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man. But to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life indeed.\u201d In other words \u2014 what exactly is worth dying for? Bloom frankly accepts that he is an old man losing his friends to death. He knows he doesn\u2019t have much time left himself. His interest is in how we expand the time we have \u2014 old or not. Falstaff, himself cartoonishly expanded on the outside, is also a human Tardis, much bigger inside than out, a kingdom got not by usurpation or bloodshed, but by pressing his being so close to life that he becomes the imprint of it. I went back to read Bloom\u2019s \u201cBook of J,\u201d his commentary on those portions of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible written by \u201cJ\u201d \u2014 a woman, Bloom proposes, and like Shakespeare, a serious creator. The Blessing, the sought-after, fought-over Blessing of Yahweh to his chosen ones, is the blessing of More Life. Or as Bloom glosses it: More Life Into a Time Without Boundaries. Bloom is passionate in his choices. This new manifesto will not appeal to the \u201cgray legions of routine Shakespeare scholars.\u201d The ones, as Bloom puts it, who prefer Hal/Henry to Falstaff, the ones on the side of authority, possibly the ones on the side of death (less messy than life), who drain the energy out of a text and offer it back as a pale imitation of itself \u2014 a counterfeit. Bloom is always a pleasure to read \u2014 the language simple and direct, yet easily conveying complexity of thought. He doesn\u2019t write like an academic. Of course, Bloom adores Falstaff\u2019s language. He quotes it to make us read it and rejoice in it. Now that the United States has a president who prefers tweets to sentences, language needs champions. Writers, dead and alive, can be recruited here, and Bloom\u2019s book is a timely reminder of the power and possibility of words. Falstaff, because he is More Life, is also More Language. He is a waterfall of words, a thundering torrent of bawdiness and beauty. His Falstaffery is made out of language: \u201cIf sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked! If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: If to be fat be to be hated, then \u2026 banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter that Harold Bloom revisits some of his earlier work (notably \u201cShakespeare: The Invention of the Human\u201d). As Samuel Johnson \u2014 one of Bloom\u2019s favorite critics on Falstaff \u2014 said, \u201cPeople need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed.\u201d Hal the pedant prince is always instructing his audiences, real and imagined. Falstaff\u2019s outrageously embodied language reminds us that life is all there is.", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T05:00:30-04:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/falstaff-shakespeare-harold-bloom.html", "item_type": "Article"}
