The company, founded in 1969 to prove that African-Americans could master ballet, had fallen into massive debt and gone into a temporary hiatus that stretched troublingly into nearly a decade. In 2013, though, the troupe had a rebirth, a bit rough yet promising. In the years since, it hasn\u2019t been just the company\u2019s shrunken size (down from 55 dancers to 16 or 17) that has made it seem like a newborn. There have also been wobbles of technique and confidence, lurches and stumbles of taste. But at City Center on Friday and Saturday, as the troupe presented its fifth New York season since the reboot, there were many encouraging signs that this beloved company has found its footing. Of the two New York premieres, \u201cBrahms Variations,\u201d by the group\u2019s under-recognized resident choreographer, Robert Garland, looked backward. Very much in a mode of George Balanchine, who was a godfather to this troupe, and his vision of the symmetries and hierarchies of French-Russian classicism, \u201cBrahms Variations\u201d is exceedingly polite, but such decorum and taste are rare enough to astonish. Moreover, what Mr. Garland has characterized as \u201cHarlem Swag\u201d comes across in his subtle musicality, which seems attached to the underpinnings of the score, with movement and music syncing at just the right moments. That\u2019s not any old Harlem swag. That\u2019s Dance Theater of Harlem swag \u2014 what the company used to be known for \u2014 and it\u2019s wonderful to see. Not everyone in Friday night\u2019s cast seemed fully assured in this classical mode \u2014 a nagging problem since the rebirth \u2014 but watching the leads especially (Chyrstyn Fentroy and Da\u2019Von Doane), you could believe in this company pulling the past into the present. The other New York premiere, Francesca Harper\u2019s \u201cSystem,\u201d struggled to be up-to-date. Its god is the choreographer William Forsythe \u2014 Ms. Harper danced in his Ballet Frankfurt after leaving Dance Theater of Harlem \u2014 and its more aggressive attack unleashes something in the dancers that Mr. Garland\u2019s choreography does not. The work also has moments of sensual beauty. But that\u2019s the trouble. It\u2019s a jumble, a mishmash of contradictory styles and ideas, worst where it strives to have a meaning: the dancers melodramatically confronting the \u201csystem\u201d of the fourth wall or a light shining in their faces. Still, all companies have misfires. And the incoherence of Ms. Harper\u2019s work served to highlight the structural finesse of Darrell Grand Moultrie\u2019s 2014 piece \u201cVessels.\u201d Seeing this work before, I was put off by the pastiche mediocrity of its Ezio Bosso score: some Philip Glass here, some Chopin meets Arvo P\u00e4rt there. The shallow music does limit the dance\u2019s depth, but it doesn\u2019t squelch Mr. Moultrie\u2019s playful wit and uncommon skill at sustaining formal continuity. Even more than Mr. Garland\u2019s, this work, contemporary but not coarse, presents the current dancers at their best. It shows them off without turning them into show-offs. And the modest merits of \u201cVessels\u201d seemed even clearer when it was repeated on Saturday, coming before a tribute to Glen Tetley. The works of that choreographer, who died in 2007, were once ubiquitous in the repertories of many major ballet companies; now they\u2019ve almost completely vanished. A valiant effort by the dancers, aided by alumni and guests from Texas Ballet Theater, failed to make that absence feel like much of a loss. Set to overwrought music that frequently makes it look ridiculous, Tetley\u2019s sleek choreography balleticizes Martha Graham, mimicking Graham\u2019s grandiosity and missing her profundity. Crossing ballet with modern dance, as Tetley was lauded and vilified for doing, seems less of a feat these days than the juxtaposition of ballet and boogie that Mr. Garland attempts in his \u201cReturn,\u201d a 1999 piece that has become the company\u2019s go-to crowd pleaser. The achievement of the work is the clever way it matches ballet steps to the brilliance of James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Its weakness is the cuteness of ballet dancers trying to get down. But that weakness reveals a strength. Dance Theater of Harlem is not a rerun of \u201cSoul Train.\u201d It\u2019s a ballet company, and a good one again.", "abstract": "The troupe presented its fifth New York season since its reboot, at City Center."}
