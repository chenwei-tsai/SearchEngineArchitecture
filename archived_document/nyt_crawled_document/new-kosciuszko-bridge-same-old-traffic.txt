{"text": "New Yorkers gazed out at the towering new Kosciuszko Bridge as they prepared to drive across the shiny span for the first time on Friday morning. Then they cursed the traffic stretching endlessly before them. It was a rare sight in New York \u2014 the first major new bridge built in the city since the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964. And drivers were happy to say goodbye to the unsightly and creaky 78-year-old bridge it is replacing. But despite excitement over the new bridge, drivers still found themselves sitting in clogged traffic on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, the highway carried by the bridge. Some said the congestion seemed worse as drivers adapted to new traffic patterns on a bridge that about 180,000 drivers use each day. Rich Kenney and Walter Schmidt left their office on Long Island at 6 a.m. hoping to avoid traffic. Instead, because of slowdowns approaching the Kosciuszko, it took them two hours to get to Greenpoint in Brooklyn. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any improvement,\u201d said Mr. Schmidt, a gas tank maintenance worker. \u201cIt looks nice, though. That\u2019s good.\u201d Mr. Kenney, a project manager, agreed. \u201cThe old one was the worst bridge in New York \u2014 they had to fix it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we already knew what we were driving into. But we didn\u2019t expect it to be this bad.\u201d State officials say the main traffic benefits should arrive in 2020, when a second crossing opens with several more lanes. But drivers did see some immediate perks: they no longer have to worry about the safety of the dilapidated old bridge, and the new span does not have the same steep incline that slowed large trucks down as they climbed the old one. Abdul Khan, an Uber driver who uses the bridge to travel between Brooklyn and Queens nearly every day, praised the new design and smoother ride. \u201cOn that bridge, you were jumping up and down,\u201d he said, nodding toward the old structure as he crossed the new one on Friday morning. Traffic was sluggish just south of the bridge in Brooklyn because of a car crash, but cars moved smoothly over it. Mr. Khan smiled, imagining the improvements to come. \u201cThis is going to be great once the second span opens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to save a lot of time.\u201d Aside from the damage the old Kosciuszko Bridge could cause to tires, there was the challenge of just trying to pronounce its name. The bridge was named for Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a Polish hero of the Revolutionary War. Some call it the \u201cK Bridge,\u201d or \u201cThe Koz\u201d for short. (The correct pronunciation, according to the Polish community, is \u201cKa-SHOO-sko.\u201d) The new bridge does not resolve the linguistic hazards. \u201cThe governor called it every possible pronunciation yesterday,\u201d said Mitch Waxman, a historian for the Newtown Creek Alliance, a group dedicated to enhancing the polluted body of water running under the bridge. On Thursday, Mr. Waxman attended a grand opening for the bridge led by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has focused on the project as part of an ambitious infrastructure agenda. The new bridge officially opened to the public shortly before midnight on Thursday. Crossing the new bridge in a green taxi on Friday morning, Mr. Waxman said the five-mile-per-hour pace of traffic was par for the course. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s like every day,\u201d he said in a glum tone. Mr. Waxman, who served on a stakeholders committee for the bridge, praised its cable-stayed design, which is common in Europe. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the oppressive feeling that you have with the old truss bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see the sun and the sky, and that\u2019s pretty huge.\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who might be gearing up for a presidential run in 2020, appeared ecstatic to unveil the bridge on Thursday. He rode across it in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s 1932 Packard. In a nod to the bridge\u2019s poor reputation, Mr. Cuomo, who is from Queens, said he first heard his father use expletives while crossing it. When the second bridge is completed, delays will be reduced by 65 percent, Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cThink of how much time and fuel is going to be saved,\u201d he said. Still, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a frequent critic and rival of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s, took the opportunity to take a swipe at the governor. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Freddi Goldstein, said the new Kosciuszko Bridge had benefited from a streamlined process known as \u201cdesign-build\u201d that the city cannot use. \u201cA few miles down the road, construction on the B.Q.E. is costing taxpayers $1.7 billion and countless hours of traffic \u2014 both of which could be significantly reduced if we were allowed the same process the state gave itself,\u201d Ms. Goldstein said in a statement. But for residents who live on both sides of the bridge, it was a day to celebrate. Anthony Nunziato, a florist who lives in Maspeth, Queens, said it was nice to have the spotlight on his borough. \u201cYou don\u2019t normally see a bridge like this in Brooklyn or Queens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time Manhattan is looking at us.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/new-kosciuszko-bridge-same-old-traffic.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T13:05:07-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T13:04:22-04:00", "abstract": "It\u2019s the first major new bridge built in New York City since 1964.
