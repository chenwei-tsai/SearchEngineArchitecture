{"text": "AURORA, Colo. \u2014 Vicqari Horton dropped a knee to the grass. The varsity choir piped out \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d And in the bleachers at a sun-soaked football stadium here on Saturday, parents clenched their teeth in anger or raised their fists in support. \u201cYou can\u2019t continue to slap people in the face and not expect them to stand up,\u201d said Mr. Horton, a junior tight end at Aurora Central High School who is black and began kneeling during the national anthem at games in mid-September. \u201cWhen Kaepernick kneeled, he gave us an outlet. He gave us something to do.\u201d In the weeks since Colin Kaepernick, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, took a knee during the national anthem \u2014 a protest against racial injustice \u2014 he has been discussed by President Obama, has been derided by Donald J. Trump and has helped to intensify an already roiling national debate about race, the police and the definition of patriotism. He has also pushed that conversation onto a quintessential American stage: the high school football field. Over the weekend, three-quarters of the 44 Aurora Central Trojans football players knelt during \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d before the team crushed a rival, the Hinkley Thunderbirds, 41-6. A thousand miles away, students at Madison East and Madison West High Schools in Wisconsin dropped to their knees, too. So have players at Garfield High School in Seattle; Castlemont High in Oakland, Calif.; Woodrow Wilson High in Camden, N.J.; and Mission High in San Francisco. At Omaha Central High, cheerleaders and band members have joined the protest. And in Beaumont, Tex., so have 11- and 12-year-olds from a youth team called the Beaumont Bulls. They have received a variety of responses: In the case of the Bulls, internet comments included a call for coaches to be lynched and the children to be killed. Here in Aurora, a sprawling, highly diverse suburb of Denver, the protest has invigorated a group of young people who have never known a world without viral videos of violence. They entered kindergarten about the time Facebook was born; were around the same age as Tamir Rice or Michael Brown, two African-Americans killed by police officers; and now attend one of the worst-performing schools in the state, a high school that is overwhelmingly black and Latino. In interviews, several students took issue with critics who told them that they did not understand what they were protesting. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing; we made a conscious decision,\u201d said Jalil Grimes, 17, a senior and the team\u2019s starting quarterback. \u201cWe see police do us wrong. We see our teachers give up on us and expect us to fail. We\u2019ve always seen this. Once we saw somebody else stand up against it, we just fell in line.\u201d The idea of kneeling came from several players, including Mr. Horton, who approached their coaches to ask permission to do so. The coaches gave their support, and the school district issued a statement saying it would respect their actions. \u201cAny time young kids can speak their minds, it\u2019s always good,\u201d said Tony Veasley, 49, a part-time coach for the Trojans who said six of his sons had graduated from Aurora Central. On Saturday, though, the stadium was a sea of hearts tied up in internal conflict. On the Hinkley side of the bleachers, near a mass of brass instruments and a cluster of exuberant cheerleaders \u2014 \u201cJam with us! Hey, hey!\u201d \u2014 Melinda Holt, 60, a white Army veteran, sat with her husband, wearing Thunderbird blue. They were there to watch a grandson play, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ignorance,\u201d Ms. Holt said of the kneelers. \u201cYou are dishonoring our flag for the actions of a few. That\u2019s like holding every black man or every white man accountable for what somebody else has done. And that\u2019s wrong.\u201d On the other side of the stands, a Hispanic woman named Maria Mitchell \u2014 wearing Trojan green beside her daughter T\u00e9a \u2014 said she felt conflicted over the kneeling players. She spent more than 25 years as a military wife, she said, and believes that standing for the anthem is a way to honor lives lost in war. But her children are of mixed ethnicity \u2014 black and Hispanic. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not a person of color, you don\u2019t understand any of it,\u201d she said. \u201cTo wake up every day and not know whether your kids are coming home or not, just because of their color, is ridiculous.\u201d \u201cUnless we walk in their shoes and feel what they feel on an everyday basis, we have no room to judge,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe can choose to support, or not support and be blind.\u201d The protests come at a turbulent time for Aurora Central, a school of 2,172 students that is 67 percent Hispanic and 16 percent black. More than 40 percent of students are learning English as a second language, nearly 70 percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, and officials have announced a drastic academic overhaul intended to stave off a school shutdown. Fights are a problem, and last year\u2019s football game against Hinkley ended in a clash among students that forced the police to intervene. Christian Wells, 17, an offensive and defensive lineman, ended that night in police custody, after officers confused him with someone else, he said. This year at the Hinkley game, he chose to go down on one knee. \u201cI\u2019ve seen police brutality up close and personal,\u201d he said. \u201cTo family members. To friends. To myself personally. It\u2019s like, if nothing else will stop it, maybe silently protesting will do something.\u201d On Saturday, the Trojans finished the game in a cascade of cheers, bouncing out of the stadium and onto a yellow team bus. In the parking lot, a 13-year-old Trojan fan, Damian Chavez, called the decision to kneel a \u201csign of respect for every black person in the country.\u201d A few hundred feet away, inside the empty stadium, the 81-year-old press box manager, Bob Blair, dressed in cowboy boots and Wrangler slacks, looked out onto the field. \u201cThey\u2019ve never been anywhere to see what the rest of the world hasn\u2019t got and what we have: It\u2019s called freedom,\u201d Mr. Blair said. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with it, but we can\u2019t stop it.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/national-anthem-protests-high-schools.html", "published_date": "2016-10-02T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T02:00:15-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T02:00:15-04:00", "abstract": "Like the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, football players across the country are silently taking a knee during the national anthem to protest racism.", "title": "Protest Started by Colin Kaepernick Spreads to High School Students"}
