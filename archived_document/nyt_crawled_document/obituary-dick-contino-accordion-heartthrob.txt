{"text": "Dick Contino, whose energetic accordion playing and movie-star looks made him a teenage star in the late 1940s, but whose celebrity ebbed after he was imprisoned for evading induction into the draft, died on April 19 in Fresno, Calif. He was 87. His wife, Judy, confirmed his death. For a time, Mr. Contino was a show business rarity: a heartthrob accordionist who earned up to $4,000 a week in nightclubs. \u201cDick Contino is one of the few men in musical history who have ever squeezed big money out of an accordion,\u201d Time magazine wrote in 1951. With muscled arms built up with barbells and Charles Atlas\u2019s dynamic tension exercises, Mr. Contino played the accordion like a rock star. His fingers flew over the keys. Elvis-like, he wiggled, shook and swaggered. He played polkas, jazz, romantic songs, show tunes and folk music. And, of course, \u201cLady of Spain.\u201d But his onstage physicality belied his early shyness. \u201cPlaying the accordion was like he was talking to you,\u201d his brother Victor said in an interview. Mr. Contino started playing his father\u2019s accordion and learned so well, and so quickly, that at 18 he won $5,000 in a contest staged by the popular bandleader and radio star Horace Heidt. Mr. Contino\u2019s popularity soared when he played with Mr. Heidt\u2019s band. Restless, Mr. Contino sued to break away from Mr. Heidt\u2019s contractual control, but settled and stayed for a while before leaving. Fronting his own revue, Mr. Contino sold out theaters in Milwaukee, Chicago and Pittsburgh. He was promoted as the \u201cRudolph Valentino of the accordion.\u201d A movie about his meteoric career was being discussed. He wowed audiences at Ciro\u2019s in West Hollywood. \u201cHe isn\u2019t just sensational,\u201d the gossip doyenne Hedda Hopper wrote, \u201che\u2019s youth walking into your life.\u201d But in 1951, as the Korean War headed into its second year, Mr. Contino, then only 21, was drafted into the Army and, after reporting to Fort Ord, near Monterey, Calif., bolted before his induction, overwhelmed by persistent neuroses including claustrophobia. He said he could not stand being fenced in at Fort Ord. \u201cI could never describe the anxiety attack I had,\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times in 1982. \u201cI felt I had to leave.\u201d He wandered San Francisco and entered a sanitarium before surrendering to the F.B.I. a few days later. He was indicted on a charge of refusing to submit to induction. After pleading guilty, he was fined $10,000 and served four and a half months in the federal penitentiary at McNeil Island, Wash. He entered the Army willingly in 1952 and spent much of his two years there entertaining troops in Korea. \u201cThese boys need entertainment,\u201d he told United Press while in Seoul. \u201cThey all want to hear music. They want to forget they\u2019re here, I guess.\u201d Mr. Contino was pardoned in 1954 under the provisions of a general proclamation issued two years earlier by  President Harry S. Truman that covered members of the armed forces who had been convicted of crimes before their induction. But despite his subsequent honorable service, the draft-dodger label dogged him. The sponsor of a proposed new band pulled out because of the publicity. The comedian Joey Bishop once brought him on as a guest on his late-night talk show, was enthusiastic about helping his career, but never had him on again. \u201cWhy did people resent me so much for years?\u201d Mr. Contino asked in the interview with The Los Angeles Times. \u201cWhy would certain shows pencil me in but never use me?\u201d While his career never reached its pre-draft heights, Mr. Contino performed for another 60 years. He appeared on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d; at Italian festivals in Reno, Nev., Clinton, Ind., Des Moines and Chicago; with the singer Al Martino in Florida and the impressionist Frank Gorshin in Ohio; at the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix with the orchestra leader Victor Lombardo; at Bimbo\u2019s 365 Club in San Francisco; at accordion conventions; and even at a wedding anniversary party in Yakima, Wash. Richard Joseph Contino was born on Jan. 17, 1930, in Fresno, where his parents, Pietro, a butcher, and the former Mary Giordano, ran a delicatessen. As a youngster, Mr. Contino played the piano but took up the accordion, with his father\u2019s encouragement. He had his own radio show in Fresno, on which his brother Victor turned the pages of the music for him. When Mr. Contino played a \u201cjive rendition\u201d of \u201cLady of Spain\u201d during the first of his 13 consecutive victories in Mr. Heidt\u2019s talent contest, Parade Magazine reported that the \u201cbobby-sox audience howled, stamped and clapped its hands.\u201d He won the finals of the contest a few months after graduating from high school. He left Fresno State College to focus on his music career. Mr. Contino never stopped playing the accordion even after his draft problems and the waning of the accordion craze that he had helped create. He also had a modest career in Hollywood, appearing in a few B-movies, most notably \u201cDaddy-O\u201d (1958), in which he played a truck driver who sings in a nightclub while trying to find out who killed his best friend. That film fascinated James Ellroy, the crime writer best known for \u201cL.A. Confidential.\u201d A photograph taken of a young Mr. Ellroy shortly after being told that his mother had been murdered in 1958 eventually reignited his memories of the late 1950s, including Mr. Contino (\u201ca man gyrating with an accordion \u2014 pumping his \u2018Stomach Steinway\u2019 for all its worth\u201d) and \u201cDaddy-O.\u201d After finding and talking to Mr. Contino, Mr. Ellroy wrote a novella, \u201cDick Contino\u2019s Blues\u201d (1994), set in 1958 when \u201cDaddy-O\u201d was being filmed, that involves Mr. Contino\u2019s faking his own kidnapping to resurrect his career. The Contino character in the novella conjures the excitement of performing in the flush of early stardom. \u201cI pelvis-popped and pounded pianissimos; I cascaded cadenzas and humped harmonic hurricanes until the hogs hollered for hell \u2014 straight through to Horace Heidt\u2019s grand finals,\u201d Mr. Ellroy wrote. \u201cI played BIG ROOMS. I cut records. I broke hearts. Screen tests, fan clubs, magazine spreads. Critics marveled at how I hipsterized the accordion \u2014 I said all I did was make schmaltz look sexy.\u201d In addition to his wife, the former Judy Miller, and his brother Victor, Mr. Contino is survived by his son, Peter, who plays the accordion and drums; his daughters, Deidre Contino, a singer, and Merri Scaife; his stepchildren, Cathie and Robert Snowden; another brother, Peter; and two grandchildren. His first wife, Leigh Snowden, an actress, died in 1982. Mr. Contino was playing the accordion into his 80s, long after his hair turned white. His arms were still muscular (sometimes shown off in sleeveless shirts), and he still easily strapped on his 27-pound Petosa AM 1100 accordion to vigorously play a set list that included \u201cContino Boogie.\u201d \u201cYou had to see him,\u201d Victor Contino said. \u201cOn his records, he was O.K. But in person, he\u2019d play for an hour. He\u2019d play hard and never sat down. And at the end, he\u2019d say, \u2018I wish I could come to your home and play.\u2019\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/music/obituary-dick-contino-accordion-heartthrob.html", "published_date": "2017-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-30T19:46:50-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Obituary (Obit)", "created_date": "2017-04-30T19:46:50-04:00", "abstract": "Mr. Contino, the inspiration for a notable novella, had been a sensation until changing times and resentment over draft evasion hurt his career.", "title": "Dick Contino, Accordion Heartthrob, Dies at 87"}
