{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As a Friday night deadline approaches to prevent a government shutdown, one hot-button spending issue is a down payment to build a wall on the southern border, one of President Trump\u2019s signature national security goals. Mr. Trump appeared to soften his demand late on Monday, saying he would settle for additional funds for border security. But then on Tuesday, he insisted again, \u201cThe wall\u2019s going to get built, folks.\u201d In the run-up to this divisive debate, John Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary, has escalated his rhetoric about threats facing the United States. \u201cThe risk is as threatening today as it was that September morning almost 16 years ago,\u201d Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, said in a speech last week at George Washington University. Mr. Kelly suggested that undocumented immigrants may not be the only threat coming across the border with Mexico, pointing to the possibility of terrorists using the same smuggling routes to infiltrate the United States. \u201cWe have tremendous threats, whether it\u2019s drugs, people, potential terrorists coming up from the south,\u201d Mr. Kelly told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last Sunday. The secretary\u2019s comments raise several questions about the threat of terrorists sneaking across the border with the aid of cartels, the connection between drug smuggling and the recent surge in overdoses, and marijuana as a \u201cgateway drug.\u201d Here\u2019s what the experts say: Not much, according to many terrorism specialists. Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University\u2019s program on extremism, said there have been few instances of would-be terrorists using the southern border to enter the United States. In some cases, he said, just the opposite has occurred: Homegrown American jihadis have crossed the southern border to get out of the United States and catch a plane from Mexico, in an effort to avoid being detected on no-fly lists. Mr. Hughes pointed to the case of Cabdulaahi Ahmed Faarax, who is wanted by the F.B.I. for conspiring to support a terrorist organization in Somalia. A naturalized American citizen who lived in Minneapolis and worked as a taxi driver, Mr. Faarax went to Somalia to fight the Shabab, a Qaeda affiliate, in 2007. He returned to the United States to try to recruit other fighters, and was last seen in October 2009 at a United States-Mexico border crossing. He is believed to be in Somalia. Terrorism experts say the Mexican drug cartels have been loath to allow terrorists to cross the border through their territories into the United States, fearing that any American military and law enforcement response to that threat would dramatically disrupt their lucrative businesses. This is exaggerated. Cartels do smuggle in vast quantities of illicit drugs, and Mr. Kelly accurately said that 52,404 deaths were caused by a drug overdose in 2015, \u201cthe highest number of drug-related deaths our country has ever seen.\u201d But it\u2019s misleading to attribute all of these to Mexican cartels. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that about 33,000 overdose deaths involved opioids. Prescription drugs like OxyContin and Vicodin were the cause of nearly 15,000 of these deaths. Synthetic opioids accounted for another 10,000 deaths and heroin 13,000. (The categories do not add up to total opioid overdoses because a death may involve more than one drug.) Prescription drugs can be obtained in the United States, but a border wall would not necessarily stop the flow of illicit opioids. Fentanyl, for example, typically originates from China and is sometimes trafficked directly into the United States or through Canada, according the Drug Enforcement Administration. The most common way of transporting drugs like heroin into the United States, the DEA reported in 2015, is stowing them in concealed compartments in vehicles through ports of entry. Other methods include using tunnels, drones, cargo trains and passenger buses \u2014 none of which would be prevented by a wall. Mr. Kelly characterized marijuana as \u201cpotentially dangerous gateway drug\u201d but there is no scientific consensus on this question. Some studies have found that people who use marijuana are more likely to take other illicit drugs compared to those who do not, but that doesn\u2019t mean cannabis causes users to seek other drugs. The main active component in marijuana, THC, dulls the brain\u2019s dopamine system, which can \u201cprime\u201d the brain and lead users to other drugs. But this is no different from those who smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. The National Institute of Drug Abuse also notes that the majority of pot users do not use \u201charder\u201d illicit drugs. Other factors like poverty, social environments, trauma, mental illness, and individual characteristics are also critical factors for drug abuse and addiction.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/fact-check-trump-border-wall-mexico.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T15:50:52-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T15:50:52-04:00", "abstract": "In anticipation of a debate over a proposed wall along the Mexican border, rhetoric about threats facing the United States has escalated.", "title": "Fact Check: The Trump Administration\u2019s Argument for a Border Wall"}
