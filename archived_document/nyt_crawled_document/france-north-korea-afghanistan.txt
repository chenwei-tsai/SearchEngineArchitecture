Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Voting in the first round of France\u2019s cliffhanger presidential election appears to put two of the 11 candidates in a runoff next month: Marine Le Pen, 48, the leader of the far-right National Front, and Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old independent who calls himself \u201cneither right nor left.\u201d Here is our live analysis of the results, and here is our guide to how the contest works and what is at stake. _____ \u2022 Tensions over North Korea threatened to rise yet higher. The North said it was ready to sink an American aircraft carrier and, according to officials, has detained a U.S. citizen. Satellite images of a North Korean nuclear site suggest that workers have stopped playing volleyball, possibly to resume preparations for a test. A national anniversary on Tuesday could furnish the occasion. Our review of Chinese news media shows a subdued tone that suggests efforts to calm North Korea and the U.S. \u2014 and ward off public panic. Above, a recent celebration in Pyongyang. _____ \u2022 Vice President Mike Pence heads to Hawaii en route to Washington after an Asia-Pacific tour intended to bolster security and trade arrangements. At his last stop, in Sydney, Australia, Mr. Pence praised a \u201cstrong and historic alliance\u201d and pledged to honor a refugee deal that President Trump had thrown into question. Mr. Trump, who is aiming to show a list of accomplishments by Saturday, his 100th day in office, hosts 14 U.N. Security Council diplomats for lunch today. _____ \u2022 An old paper trail offers new evidence of Turkish complicity in the Armenian genocide, widely acknowledged as the first of the 20th century. A Turkish historian based in the U.S. has unearthed what he calls \u201cthe smoking gun\u201d: an original telegram from post-World War I trials that convicted the planners, held in a mysteriously inaccessible archive by the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem. _____ \u2022 As private space travel nears human reach, the U.S. sets a record today. Peggy Whitson, the first woman to command the International Space Station, counts her 535th cumulative day in space \u2014 with months still to go. That\u2019s the most for an American astronaut. (Several Russians have surpassed 800 cumulative days.) President Trump celebrates with a live-streamed video call on NASA TV. \u2022 Fox News\u2019s decision to cut ties with its biggest star, Bill O\u2019Reilly, reflects the rising influence of a new generation at 21st Century Fox: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sons, James and Lachlan. \u2022 In his quest to build his company into the world\u2019s dominant ride-hailing entity, the hard-driving C.E.O. Travis Kalanick has at times brought Uber, and himself, to the precipice. \u2022 Facebook restored the account of Guo Wengui, a Chinese-born billionaire who lives in America and has raised accusations of corruption against family members of Chinese Communist Party officials, calling his brief suspension an accident. \u2022 The American airline industry suffered another public-relations disaster after a video showed a flight attendant in an altercation over a stroller with a woman traveling with two children. Such episodes undercut the rigorous conflict de-escalation courses that flight attendants receive. \u2022  Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Afghanistan declared a national day of mourning after the Taliban killed scores of soldiers and officers on Friday in the single deadliest attack on an Afghan military base in the country\u2019s 16-year war. [The New York Times] \u2022 A 73-year-old woman who is one of Kenya\u2019s most renowned conservationists was airlifted for surgery after being shot by raiders in an area where armed pastoralists are terrorizing farmers. [The New York Times] \u2022 Gas prices in North Korea have suddenly spiked, creating long lines in the capital, Pyongyang, where car use has risen in recent years. [The Associated Press] \u2022 A $200,000 beach hut is among the lavish assets that Australian prosecutors have moved to confiscate from the suspected drug kingpin Rocco Arico. [The Age] \u2022 A liberal blogger in the Maldives who had complained to the police about death threats over his satires of the government and radical Islam died after being stabbed. [The New York Times] \u2022 China announces the results of a geographic census meant in part \u201cto standardize names in ethnic languages.\u201d India, for one, sees it as a move to expand China\u2019s sovereignty claims. [SundayGuardianLive] \u2022 After some rest and relaxation in French Polynesia aboard David Geffen\u2019s yacht, Barack Obama returns to Chicago today for his first public event as a former president. [The New York Times] \u2022 There\u2019s no one rule for staying married, but being able to embrace change sure helps. \u2022 Impactful activities may be just that: running and jumping can improve bone health. But brisk walks and other light, whole-body vibration exercises help, too. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Make a better chicken salad. No, wait: Make the best. \u2022 Our Tokyo bureau chief traveled to Naraha, a hamlet in Fukushima where schoolchildren have returned six years after the nuclear disaster. They bring hope, but caution remains high. \u201cCafeteria workers measure the radiation in fresh ingredients used in lunches,\u201d she writes. \u2022 The world\u2019s oldest person, Emma Morano, died this month at 117, and our photographer cataloged the objects she left behind. \u2022 Not so Dickensian anymore: For the first time since the Industrial Revolution, Britain went a day without burning coal for power, a milestone that heartened climate activists. Take a moment to appreciate the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched aboard the shuttle Discovery on this day in 1990. For 27 years, it has sent us images of far-distant celestial wonders, captured in stunning detail. The $1.5 billion telescope is the length of a school bus, and orbits the Earth at about 17,000 miles per hour. It\u2019s expected to keep working until at least 2020. The Hubble\u2019s first pictures lacked clarity because of major flaws with the telescope\u2019s mirror, necessitating a repair trip. All in all, the telescope has required five major repairs, replacements or upgrades, the last of which was in 2009. The reward? Gorgeous photographs, like the one above of the so-called \u201cPillars of Creation,\u201d part of the Eagle Nebula nearly 7,000 light years from Earth. And this recent close-up of Jupiter, 415 million miles away. Its successor, NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to launch in 2018. This telescope, equipped with a much bigger mirror, is designed to see deeper into space than the Hubble, and may solve mysteries about how the first stars and galaxies were created.
