{"text": "LONDON \u2014 This will be remembered as a year when art got seriously political. The Whitney Biennial in New York and the inaugural Athens edition of Documenta are just two of the high-profile exhibitions trying to convey and confront the tumult of our times. Dana Schutz\u2019s painting \u201cOpen Casket,\u201d showing the mutilated corpse of Emmett Till, the African-American teenager lynched in Mississippi in 1955, drew protests at the Whitney and online last month. And viewers were hardly less disturbed in Athens when they watched Artur Zmijewski\u2019s 20-minute film \u201cGlimpse,\u201d chronicling the misery of the refugee camp, now demolished, in Calais, France, known as the Jungle. Institutional exhibitions and the art market can be very different worlds. The updated wall label next to Ms. Schutz\u2019s divisive painting states that it will not be sold, and Mr. Zmijewski\u2019s disturbing documentaries are not the stuff of Sotheby\u2019s or Christie\u2019s auctions. Yet art with a political edge, or at least a heightened awareness of this moment, has made an impact at commercial galleries in London over the last couple of weeks. Jordan Wolfson\u2019s 2017 virtual reality work \u201cReal Violence,\u201d which comes with a \u201ctrigger warning\u201d and an age restriction, was one of the most talked-of, and written-about, pieces at the Whitney Biennial. This two-minute-and-25-second digital animation, to be viewed through a virtual reality headset, seems to show the artist using a baseball bat to beat a stranger to death in a New York street. Mr. Wolfson\u2019s \u201cact of unexplained violence\u201d (as the Whitney put it) can also be experienced in London at Sadie Coles HQ\u2019s first exhibition devoted to this New York artist, which opened on Thursday night. The work was made in an edition of 10, with two versions reserved for the artist, and it is being offered at an undisclosed price by Ms. Coles and the New York dealer David Zwirner. More than half of the edition has been sold, according to Julia Joern, a partner at Zwirner. \u201cReal Violence\u201d was inspired by a YouTube clip of men fighting that is included in the longer 2017 video \u201cRiverboat Song,\u201d in which Mr. Wolfson\u2019s cartoonish, Huckleberry Finn-like alter ego sings, dances and soliloquizes in a surreal, web-based alternate reality. Both works are on view at Ms. Coles\u2019s HQ gallery, together with two new mixed-media sculptures: \u201cHouse With Face\u201d and \u201cBlack Sculpture,\u201d each made in editions of three, along with one for the artist. They further develop Mr. Wolfson\u2019s theme of an American fairy tale turned nightmare. Though prices were not released in London, Ms. Joern said that Mr. Wolfson\u2019s work ranges from $85,000 to $3 million in New York. On Nov. 10, 2016, two days after Donald J. Trump was elected president, Mr. Wolfson gave a rousing speech at the Swiss Institute\u2019s 30th-anniversary benefit dinner in New York. \u201cThese are the people who are going to be holding up a mirror to culture,\u201d he said, identifying artists in the audience. \u201cThese are the people who are going to show you the world.\u201d But Mr. Wolfson, 36, does not view himself as a political artist. Speaking in London on Thursday, he pointed out that \u201cReal Violence\u201d was started two years ago, long before Mr. Trump was elected. \u201cI\u2019m letting culture pass through me, and it takes shape,\u201d he said. \u201cI let things pass through in a nonjudgmental way so that I can explore themes like violence and sexuality.\u201d Far more overt in its political intent is the latest work of the Los Angeles-based artist Awol Erizku, who has questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s suitability to be the 45th president of the United States. The result has been the ironically titled solo show \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d at Ben Brown Fine Arts in Mayfair, which runs through June 2. \u201cAs Trump rose to power, he got more and more powerful for my work,\u201d said Mr. Erizku, 28, who was born in Ethiopia and is best known for taking the portrait with which Beyonc\u00e9 chose to announce her pregnancy, drawing almost 11 million \u201clikes\u201d on Instagram. \u201cWe can always make work that\u2019s beautiful, but the point of art is to change the world a little bit,\u201d he added. The London show, his first in Europe, consists of 15 works in a range of media. They include an American flag overprinted with a black panther, and corrugated iron paintings, daubed in one case with the number 12 (street slang for the police), and in another with numbers representing the past four American presidents, but with those of George W. Bush and Mr. Trump crossed out. That last piece was bought by an American collector based in London for $27,000, and all of the works have sold, for prices going up to about $50,000. Mr. Brown said that collectors had primarily reacted to the visual qualities of Mr. Erizku\u2019s works, rather than to their political content. Buyers were also aware that the unique works, by an artist who has been validated by a singer with more than 100 million Instagram followers, were less expensive than his recent auction high of $52,500. That was the bid at a Phillips auction in New York on April 4 for the 2009 limited-edition photograph \u201cGirl With a Bamboo Earring,\u201d inspired by Vermeer. By comparison,  Thaddaeus Ropac\u2019s elegantly refurbished 16,000-foot gallery in a Georgian townhouse in Mayfair, which opened on Wednesday, appears to be a more apolitical operation. Mr. Ropac, who also has spaces in Paris and Salzburg, Austria, debuted at 37 Dover Street in London with four presentations, two of which combine works on loan and for sale: Early-1970s Gilbert & George videos and photographic \u201cDrinking Pieces,\u201d one of which is available for 145,000 pounds, or about $185,000, and another at 150,000; Conceptual and Minimal works from the collection of Egidio Marzona (prices yet to be disclosed); new works by the British sound sculptor Oliver Beer, priced at \u00a310,000 to \u00a3100,000; and early drawings by Joseph Beuys, shown alongside the enigmatic cast-iron sculpture \u201cBackrest of a Fine-Limbed Person (Hare-Type) of the 20th Century A.D.,\u201d dating from 1972 to 1982 and on sale for 2.5 million euros. This might look like business as usual at the top end of the commercial art world. It\u2019s worth remembering, however, the extent to which Joseph Beuys was revered as a political artist-cum-activist in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s. Perhaps that is the very reason his auction high is $1.2 million, according to Artnet, a figure that seems almost derisory for an artist of his importance and influence. \u201cAll art is political to some degree, but the commercial market has never really loved politics as a subject,\u201d said Paul Schimmel, a former partner at the international dealership Hauser & Wirth. Last spring, Mr. Schimmel established a 28,000-square-foot Los Angeles mega-gallery, Hauser Wirth & Schimmel, which opened with the ambitious, museum-style show \u201cRevolution in the Making: Abstract Sculpture by Women, 1947\u20132016.\u201d He left the company in February, without comment from either party, and he has returned to curating nonprofit exhibitions. \u201cArtists aren\u2019t making political work for the market, it\u2019s for people watching the world,\u201d said Mr. Schimmel, who was once chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. \u201cGoya made the greatest political art, but the market wasn\u2019t kind to him, either.\u201d Maybe the market will be kinder to the would-be Goyas of our day.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/design/art-goes-political-but-will-that-fly-on-the-london-market.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T14:35:56-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T14:35:56-04:00", "abstract": "Art with a political edge, or at least a heightened awareness of this moment, is starting to make an impact at commercial galleries in the British capital.", "title": "Art Goes Political, but Will That Fly on the London Market?"}
