{"text": "Tracey Wigfield is a rising star in television comedy, a Tina Fey prot\u00e9g\u00e9e who won an Emmy as one of the youngest writers on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and is now the creator and showrunner of a new NBC sitcom, \u201cGreat News.\u201d  Among the comedy writing in-crowd, however, her mother, Kathy, is nearly as well known. Kathy Wigfield may be the only 61-year-old paralegal from suburban New Jersey who texts regularly with Mindy Kaling \u2014 her daughter\u2019s former boss on \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d \u2014 and spent a family vacation at Disney World with Ms. Fey. At a party after the \u201c30 Rock\u201d finale in 2013, Jack McBrayer, who played Kenneth the page, approached Mrs. Wigfield and told her, \u201cYou\u2019re like everyone\u2019s mom.\u201d Sitting beside her daughter recently over frittatas at Sarabeth\u2019s on Central Park South, Mrs. Wigfield laughed at the memory. \u201cI look at them as like my little kids,\u201d she said, smiling. Now, Wigfield mother and daughter, who speak every day and call each other their best friends, are having an onscreen moment. Their relationship inspired \u201cGreat News,\u201d which features a New Jersey mother named Carol Wendelson \u2014 played with septuagenarian pizazz by Andrea Martin \u2014 who lands an internship at the local TV news station where her daughter, Katie (Briga Heelan), works as a producer. Carol proceeds to insert herself into every aspect of her child\u2019s professional and personal life. Sound familiar? \u201cI wanted to write about her because she was a funny character in my life,\u201d Ms. Wigfield, 33, said as her mother fussed with her daughter\u2019s clothing \u2014 couldn\u2019t she have worn a better shirt? \u2014 and discussed their plans to see that evening\u2019s performance of \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d \u201cMy mother\u2019s crazy,\u201d Ms. Wigfield added. \u201cBut I\u2019m also really into my mom.\u201d Carol Wendelson is closely modeled after Kathy Wigfield, down to her head-to-toe outfits from the retailer Chico\u2019s. When Mrs. Wigfield visited the \u201cGreat News\u201d set in Los Angeles last year, she encountered Ms. Martin in full costume \u2014 coincidentally wearing the same colorful paisley-print top. In real life, Mrs. Wigfield is not a stage mom in the classic overbearing sense. It was her daughter\u2019s idea to try show business, not hers. \u201cShe used to say, \u2018Get me a manager so we can go on auditions,\u2019 Mrs. Wigfield recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to begin doing that.\u201d Ms. Wigfield acted in commercials as a child, including an ad for a toy called the Glitterator that featured her shouting, \u201cIt\u2019s Glitter-ific!\u201d She later interned at David Letterman\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d before landing at \u201c30 Rock.\u201d \u201cTina recognized her wonderful talent,\u201d recalled David Miner, a \u201c30 Rock\u201d executive producer who, along with several other alumni from the show, is working on \u201cGreat News.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of people who aren\u2019t really ready to run their own show. Tracey was so ready for this.\u201d After \u201c30 Rock,\u201d Ms. Wigfield decamped to Los Angeles for a senior position at \u201cThe Mindy Project,\u201d where she was a writer, a co-executive producer and played a small onscreen role. (In \u201cGreat News,\u201d she plays Beth, an oddball meteorologist.) She signed a development deal with Universal Studios and ran the mother-daughter idea by Ms. Fey, who quickly approved. Ms. Fey and her creative partner Robert Carlock are executive producers of \u201cGreat News,\u201d and offered weekly input on scripts via Skype from New York to the writers\u2019 room in Los Angeles. The show, set in the lower-rent waters of local TV news, is taped on set that is a near-copy of the NY1 studio in Manhattan, where the pilot was filmed. Ms. Wigfield, whose corner office on the Universal lot features the same framed photo of thermostats that appeared in Liz Lemon\u2019s office on \u201c30 Rock,\u201d said that she was drawn to the idea of an older woman finding workplace success late in life despite coming from a generation in which women were not always encouraged to pursue careers. Her mother, she recalled, often accosts network executives at events, including Robert Greenblatt, NBC\u2019s head of entertainment. \u201cShe would corner NBC execs and be like, \u2018Do you know anyone at \u2018Days of Our Lives\u2019?\u201d Tracey Wigfield said, laughing. At one point, Mrs. Wigfield talked a producer of \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d into hiring her other daughter, Ashley, for a small role. \u201cKnowing my mom, she without a doubt could have been a great agent, or an executive, or a TV writer, or a million things,\u201d Ms. Wigfield said, her mother beaming beside her. \u201cMy mom and women of her generation weren\u2019t pushed in the same way I was.\u201d During a recent taping, Ms. Wigfield was fully comfortable leading a team of dozens, joking with cast members, conferring with her director between takes and ironing out details on set. At one point, she and other writers were brainstorming ideas for which faded celebrity they could turn into a wax-figure prop. \u201cCan we get Justin Guarini? What\u2019s he doing?\u201d Ms. Wigfield asked, referring to the now-obscure \u201cFrom Justin to Kelly\u201d co-star. Somebody suggested Richard Hatch from \u201cSurvivor.\u201d Would the Menendez brothers work? Finally, a winner was declared: Air Bud, the basketball-playing dog. \u201cGoogling \u201990s celebrities and picking one \u2014 that\u2019s 90 percent of comedy writing,\u201d Ms. Wigfield said, closing her MacBook. Despite living across the country, her mother is never far away. She visited her daughter\u2019s set several times, leading to a few pranks in which crew members sneaked her into scenes, surprising the younger Ms. Wigfield. Last spring, Ms. Wigfield\u2019s pilot was picked up by NBC a week before her wedding; she had a brief honeymoon in Italy before rushing back to Los Angeles to start production. Over brunch, Ms. Wigfield recalled that she and her mother spent New Year\u2019s reminiscing about their momentous 2016. \u201cYour favorite was when my show got picked up,\u201d Ms. Wigfield, one eyebrow arched, reminded her mother. \u201cNot my wedding.\u201d The matriarch threw up her hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t sit around thinking, \u2018Oh, one day when she gets married \u2026 \u2019\u201d Mrs. Wigfield explained. \u201cAnybody can get married! I\u2019m happy she found the guy she did.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cnot everyone has a TV show.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/arts/television/great-news-gives-a-mother-daughter-team-an-onscreen-moment.html", "published_date": "2017-04-30T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Arts", "updated_date": "2017-05-01T13:11:55-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-01T13:11:55-04:00", "abstract": "Tracey Wigfield is used to her suburbanite mother inserting herself into her professional and personal life.
