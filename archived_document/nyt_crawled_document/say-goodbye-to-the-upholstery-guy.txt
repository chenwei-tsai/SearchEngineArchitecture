{"text": "The upholstery guy. A cabinet builder. A drapery company. A hair-dye maker. A sprawling used-books/records/C.D. business. These have been the occupants of the stodgy, serviceable industrial spaces of Long Island City, Queens. Now their day in the city is coming to an end. What a developer calls two \u201ccharacter-rich locations\u201d in the neighborhood are being emptied of their last industrial tenants within a few days. They are being replaced by companies that will pay four or five times as much in rent. Whatever character remains, characters will be gone. Many factors drive such changes, but for the Blanchard and Paragon Buildings, a few blocks apart, a remarkable dynamic is involved: the building of a distant subway station. At Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan, the Related Companies and Oxford Properties are constructing what they call \u201cthe largest private real estate development in the history of the United States.\u201d You could say it is a private development, which it is. You could also say the entire thing was feasible only because the residents of New York City borrowed nearly $3 billion to extend the No. 7 train from Times Square about two miles to 34th Street and 11th Avenue. Most likely, there would be no Hudson Yards without that subway. What irrigation is to farmland, subways are to real estate. Related bought the two Queens buildings last year, and is marketing them as back office space for Hudson Yards. As the company notes, it\u2019s just five stops on the 7 train from Long Island City to the new development. VaynerMedia, a digital advertising agency, an early tenant of Hudson Yards, is also taking 43,000 square feet in Related\u2019s Blanchard Building, which stretches along 21st Street from Borden Avenue to 51st Avenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a great space, and will be easy for my team to get to and from VaynerMedia\u2019s Hudson Yards headquarters,\u201d Gary Vaynerchuk, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a news release last month. The industrial tenants in the building when it was bought had 12 months to get out. Kayel De Angelis, whose family went into the custom upholstered furniture business in 1955, said he had been paying $11 a square foot. \u201cThe best I could find in the city, looking around, is $26 a foot,\u201d Mr. De Angelis said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way.\u201d Instead, he said, he found a building in Glen Head, N.Y., on Long Island, \u201csort of close to the train, to have some convenience for the designers, decorators and employees.\u201d The rent on Long Island was about half of what it cost in the city, but he and his family decided to buy the building to avoid another move. Ranee Jaber of DY Realty, whose primary business had been setting up leases for industrial space, said the city had very little available. The Brooklyn and Queens waterfronts were rezoned during the Bloomberg years to allow commercial and residential development. Demand has also grown for Bronx real estate, he said. \u201cNo one wants office space \u2014 they want industrial spaces that have been turned into office,\u201d Mr. Jaber said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge appetite for this kind of aesthetic. They market these things by harkening back, the \u2018Bindery,\u2019 the \u2018Zipper Factory.\u2019 \u201cThey\u2019re all pushing this old industrial past and, meanwhile, getting rid of industry.\u201d In theory, most of the debt on the No. 7 extension was supposed to be paid by the increased property values on the Far West Side of Manhattan. That has not worked out so far. The city has put up $359 million to pay the interest, said George Sweeting, deputy director of the New York City Independent Budget Office. Once Hudson Yards starts paying its share of the subway construction, the rest of the city will pay to provide services to the development like schools, sanitation, police and fire. Kris Schrey owns BklynBooks, and had his warehouse for 250,000 used books and close to one million C.D.s in the Blanchard Building. He is moving to Paterson, N.J. \u201cOver the years, I had 500 employees, many of them college students,\u201d Mr. Schrey said, but noted that many workers in the building did not have college educations. \u201cThe jobs, like upholstery, destroyed through the conversion of the building are for people in Maspeth or Jackson Heights without an Ivy League education.\u201d Mr. De Angelis said two of his 31 employees had quit because of the move to Long Island, and he hopes to hold on to the rest. \u201cWhere is the base of having different sorts of work?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt can\u2019t all be just real estate, hotels and banking.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/say-goodbye-to-the-upholstery-guy.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T20:05:55-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T20:05:55-04:00", "abstract": "The extension of the No. 7 train to Manhattan\u2019s Far West Side reverberates in Queens, where industrial tenants have been pushed out in favor of back-office types.", "title": "Say Goodbye to the Upholstery Guy"}
