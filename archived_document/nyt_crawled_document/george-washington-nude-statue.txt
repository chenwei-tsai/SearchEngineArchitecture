And, no, he didn\u2019t pose for it.", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "text": "It is a statue of the father of our country that America has never seen: George Washington in the buff. He is not wearing a velvet suit, as he does in the stony-faced Gilbert Stuart portrait. He is not wearing a Continental Army uniform, as he does in the painting \u201cWashington Crossing the Delaware.\u201d Nor is he wearing a Roman toga, as he does in another statue. That Washington, naked from the waist up, offended Victorian-era sensibilities in the nation\u2019s capital. A founding father\u2019s pecs and abs were too much for the 1840s. The naked Washington is a not-quite-200-year-old plaster statue by the Italian sculptor Antonio Canova \u2014 a 30-inch preliminary model for a life-size image of Washington that was going to show him in a Roman soldier\u2019s uniform (with the torso covered). The naked statue is coming to the United States for the first time for an exhibition called \u201cCanova\u2019s George Washington,\u201d which is scheduled to open next year at the Frick Collection. A full-size plaster model will also make its American debut, along with sketches and drawings, all lent by the Museo Antonio Canova in Possagno, Italy. The museum is a shrine to Canova, the foremost neo-Classical sculptor of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Canova was celebrated while he was alive, with Goethe and Wordsworth in the chorus of admirers. Flaubert managed to plant a kiss on Canova\u2019s \u201cCupid and Psyche\u201d and declare, \u201cI was kissing beauty itself.\u201d Canovian beauty was what North Carolina got when the General Assembly decided to honor Washington. This was soon after the War of 1812, when the still-young United States was celebrating its place among nations. Someone asked Thomas Jefferson who could produce a suitable statue. \u201cThere can be but one answer to this,\u201d he responded. \u201cOld Canove of Rome.\u201d Jefferson got Canova\u2019s name wrong, but Canova got the commission. It was his only work that was destined for the United States. As Xavier F. Salomon, the Frick\u2019s chief curator observed, \u201cA commission from America then, it was like a commission from Mars.\u201d Canova did the naked Washington in preparation for the final statue, which he sent to Raleigh in 1821. The completed statue sat in the state\u2019s House until it was ruined in a fire in 1831. (A replica was installed in 1970.) As a preliminary piece, the naked Washington never left Canova\u2019s studio in Italy. Mr. Salomon said North Carolinians almost certainly had not known about it, even though artists often did naked versions of their subjects \u2014 in effect, sketches in plaster \u2014 as they thought through the process of turning cold, hard stone into hair, skin and soft-looking fabric. \u201cIt is one of the four preliminary models, part of the preparatory work,\u201d Mr. Salomon said, and it was practical, not prurient. \u201cHe always did a nude model of his sculptures so he could understand how the body worked under the drapery,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely standard practice. He would start with rough drawings and then move to three-dimensional plaster models such as this one.\u201d Mr. Salomon does not know who posed for the body. It was not Washington. The first president had been dead for 17 years by the time Canova went to work. Canova had done a nude Napoleon as the god Mars about 10 years earlier. But when it came to Washington, clothes made the man \u2014 and the statue \u2014 because his appearance mattered. \u201cJohn Marshall, his first serious biographer, even entitled the chapter on Washington\u2019s arrival in the world \u2018The Birth of Mr. Washington,\u2019\u201d the historian Joseph J. Ellis wrote, \u201csuggesting that he was born fully clothed and ready to assume the presidency.\u201d Nathaniel Hawthorne seemed to echo Marshall\u2019s notion after posing a provocative question: \u201cDid anybody ever see Washington naked?\u201d \u201cIt is inconceivable,\u201d Hawthorne wrote. \u201cHe had no nakedness, but, I imagine, was born with clothes on and his hair powdered, and made a stately bow on his first appearance in the world.\u201d Canova must have realized that it was hard not to notice Washington. He stood at least 6 feet, 2 inches tall, six inches taller than average in those days; weighed about 175 pounds; and had unusually large hands and feet. Mr. Salomon said Canova had seemed to struggle with the arms as he worked to show Washington writing his farewell address on a stone tablet. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get the muscles,\u201d Mr. Salomon said. But Canova did not have much to go on. He never saw Washington and relied on a bust owned by an American diplomat who shipped it to Canova\u2019s studio in Rome. \u201cAt that point, America was still searching for who their heroes were,\u201d Mr. Salomon said. \u201cThey were trying to define the history of a country that has no history.\u201d For the North Carolinians, the Canova commission must have had a keeping-up-with-the-Joneses flavor \u2014 they were well aware that Virginia\u2019s State Capitol already had a statue, by Jean-Antoine Houdon, that showed Washington in a military uniform. Mr. Salomon said Canova had chosen the Roman imagery carefully. What interested Canova about Washington was not that he had outsmarted the British in the Revolutionary War, or that he had presided at the creation of a new country. To Europeans, Mr. Salomon said, \u201cwhat was bizarre was that someone who was running a state had stepped down from power \u2014 no one ever did that.\u201d Except Cincinnatus, a former general whom the Romans summoned to be dictator. He served for 15 days, then resigned and went back to his farm, much as Washington went back to Mount Vernon after the presidency. Mr. Salomon said zeroing in on the naked statue \u201cis kind of schoolboyish.\u201d \u201cI hope people understand it\u2019s about classical bodies and ancient statuary and all that,\u201d he added. Yes, but it is a departure for American presidential iconography. Sean Wilentz, a history professor at Princeton, said he could not think of a single major commemorative statue \u201cin which you have nudes.\u201d Last summer, naked statues of Donald J. Trump were placed in Union Square and in public spaces in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland and Seattle. DNAinfo.com reported that the one in Union Square was gone after about two hours, removed by Parks Department workers. \u201cThe very idea of having a nude Washington in the 1820s would have been scandalous,\u201d Professor Wilentz said. \u201cIf you go to Statuary Hall in the Capitol, they\u2019re all there, tobacco-chewing politicians who all look like Roman gods. That was the style. You really have to talk to an art historian about the place of the nude in American art, but looking at American politics, I mean, no, we never have our presidents in the buff.\u201d And then he quoted a line from the Bob Dylan song \u201cIt\u2019s Alright, Ma (I\u2019m Only Bleeding)\u201d: \u201cBut even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s from 1965,\u201d Professor Wilentz said. \u201cThe very idea is mischievous, to say the least.\u201d"}
