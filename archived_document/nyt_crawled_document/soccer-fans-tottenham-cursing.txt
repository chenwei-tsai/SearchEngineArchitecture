{"text": "LONDON \u2014 There\u2019s a helpful sign on the backs of seats in the family section at White Hart Lane, home of Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cMind your language,\u201d it begins. \u201cThe north stand is our family stand,\u201d it continues, with the second part of the sentence boldfaced. \u201cTherefore, our club would like to remind supporters to show consideration for the large number of children and families that occupy this area.\u201d Then, more boldface. \u201cPlease refrain from using foul and abusive language or behavior of a threatening nature.\u201d When my younger son, Eli, pointed out this stern, bright yellow notice to me, he had a huge grin on his face. He had just turned 10, was earning an allowance for the first time and was ready to expand his vocabulary. This was our second Spurs game since moving to London, and we knew what was coming. As far as he was concerned, White Hart Lane was a safe space where he could learn to cuss. Sure enough, the obscenities began to rain down a minute or two later, and my two sons could not contain their glee. A player for Manchester City had broken away toward the goal, but at his moment of opportunity he stumbled over, collapsing and then recoiling, his face contorted in agony. We were in the third row, so this happened almost at our feet. The crowd, already standing, began to erupt, as if the ancient Romans had returned to rule the city and a fallen gladiator was before us. Our section began heaping all manner of abuse on this hapless invader. Fans yelled insults about his backside, insults about his front side, insults about his tender parts and insults about his mental health. \u201cThat man across the aisle just used the F-word!\u201d Eli said in a loud whisper. Yes, I got that. Because it was hard to miss. So was the guy screaming the same word right behind us. Even the British child in front of us, who had probably been to a hundred of these games, turned around with a look of awe and excitement. I went back to reading the rest of the sign on the chair. \u201cStewards will be monitoring this area closely \u2026\u201d Sure they will. \u201c\u2026 and any supporter who does not comply with this request risks being ejected from the stadium \u2026\u201d Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. That\u2019s not going to happen. \u201c\u2026 and having their season ticket or club membership canceled without a refund.\u201d I highly doubt that. Soccer is hard for many Americans to embrace. Even the British were a bit conflicted at first. A forerunner of the modern game was banned by King Edward II in a 1314 decree warning that \u201cthere is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large balls from which many evils may arise.\u201d A half-century later, his son King Edward III tried again. While his archery law required bow and arrow practice on Sundays and holidays, he forbade as distractions sports like football and cockfighting \u201cunder pain of imprisonment.\u201d I, too, had mixed feelings, until we went to see the Spurs play. Our seats were right behind one of the goals, which had the disadvantage of making action at the far end of the field a distant muddle. But when the game came to our end, it felt as if we were in the middle of something profound. We ducked at errant shots and ricocheting corner kicks; my brother-in-law, watching the match on television in America, saw us in the crowd more than once. It was my older son, Casey, now 14, who first latched onto Tottenham after we arrived in 2013. It was a middling club at the time, but Casey dismissed supporting Arsenal, the north London team preferred by most of his friends, as akin to rooting for the Yankees. And we were Mets fans. As he put it, \u201cI wanted a team that wasn\u2019t the utter best but that wasn\u2019t the utter worst.\u201d As it happened, he picked the Spurs just as their fortunes began to improve; this season, Tottenham is in second place in the Premier League. The full cultural significance of soccer took a while to sink in. During the 2014 World Cup, I joined a crowd at a local tennis club watching England\u2019s national team. After about 20 minutes \u2014 which at that point was more televised soccer than I had ever watched at one time \u2014 I got up to leave. The club\u2019s cook, who had bonded with me over a mutual appreciation for heavy metal, shot me a stricken look. He began gesturing, out of view of the other men, in a downward motion. \u201cDanny,\u201d he mouthed. \u201cSit down.\u201d Clearly, walking out on the home country\u2019s World Cup game before the final whistle was a breach of protocol. I sheepishly obeyed. The gravity of being a soccer spectator was further driven home after I heard a warning issued by a recorded voice on the Spurs ticket line. It was a woman\u2019s voice, speaking in the manner of a stern headmistress. \u201cTickets purchased on this line are for home matches at White Hart Lane and home supporters only,\u201d the recording said. \u201cAnyone found supporting the visiting team will be ejected from the stadium and will not be refunded.\u201d Opposing fans at White Hart Lane and at all other Premier League stadiums are segregated into special sections, often surrounded by phalanxes of security guards in bright orange coats. There is reason for vigilance. In 1985, English clubs were banned from European competitions after 39 people died when rioting by Liverpool fans led to a stampede during the Champions League final in Belgium. Rioting by Spurs fans in 1974, at  a cup final in Rotterdam, prompted the club\u2019s chairman to implore them on the stadium\u2019s loudspeaker, \u201cYou are disgracing the British people.\u201d Our family has learned to take the game seriously. When Tottenham\u2019s star striker, Harry Kane, scores, we join in a guttural chant: Ees-un-of-er-own, ees-un-of-er-own, ay-ree-kane, ees-un-of-er-own. And we know when to keep quiet. A couple of years ago, before we entered the stadium to watch the Spurs play Manchester City, Casey paused for a moment, uncharacteristically attuned to his surroundings. \u201cIf we lose,\u201d he advised me and his brother, \u201cyou can\u2019t say a word until we\u2019re on the Northern line.\u201d It would take three trains to get home, and the Northern line was the last one. He had learned that making any comments after a loss was sort of like joking about a bomb at the airport. I couldn\u2019t remember my son ever lecturing me about anything. I was touched. Eli was more interested in other details. After we reached our seats for the game, he pointed up to the scoreboard and began reading a message flashing on it. \u201cKeep the passion\u201d the words said. \u201cLose the language.\u201d He was giddy with anticipation. The Spurs lost that day. We kept our ears open and, afterward, our mouths shut.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/sports/soccer/soccer-fans-tottenham-cursing.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Sports", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T03:00:27-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-05-02T03:00:27-04:00", "abstract": "A Times reporter and his sons got an education in soccer, and swearing, in visits to Tottenham\u2019s White Hart Lane.", "title": "The Team Wore White.
