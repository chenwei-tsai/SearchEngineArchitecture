{"text": "Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. Some comments were edited for length and clarity. 1. Broadway shows and museums, which as a child I was able to enjoy, are so much money that many families can\u2019t afford these trips anymore. So the result? The pool of future patrons getting smaller and smaller because you\u2019re not building a loyal audience base, especially among the young. This has to be considered. For a family of four, it\u2019s nearly a $100 entrance fee for a museum. And free nights or reduced-rate nights are crowded beyond belief. For a Broadway show it could easily be close to $400. Meanwhile we have an administration that thinks the arts are worthless. So are we building upon a legacy or destroying one? \u2014 Shirley Gazsi on The Times\u2019 Facebook page, responding to an article about the Metropolitan Museum of Art considering a mandatory $25 entry fee for non-New York City residents. 2. If you can pay $33 to see Madame Tussauds in Times Square, you can afford to pay $25 to see some real, world-class art. \u2014 Brian in New Jersey. 3. France does not want to give up on the European Union \u2014 it\u2019s a dream, and a reality, that we\u2019ve worked hard to achieve. We are stronger together, and now form the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. No one here had to hold their nose and vote for Macron as the best of the worst. He is qualified, no stranger to politics and has universal support from the center right, and Socialist parties. He is by no means inept. Le Pen wishes to move backward, he wishes to go forward \u2014 En Marche! \u2014 Lilou in Paris, reacting to an article about France\u2019s presidential election. A runoff election will be held May 7. This comment received more than 240 reader recommendations. 4. If Macron could not improve the French economy during the last five years as minister for Hollande, how is he going to do it as president for the next five years? Macron failed in his job for Hollande\u2019s disastrous administration and voters are acting like he\u2019s somehow a new and different politician in this election. Voting for Macron is purely wishful thinking that he can somehow morph into a different person. France needs a new start by leaving the European Union, returning to the French franc, and electing a totally independent president who has no association with the status quo and the establishment politics of the past. It\u2019s time for Marine Le Pen! \u2014 Michael Kittle in Vaison la Romaine, France. 5. Instead of exploring these indulgent fantasies of turning science fiction toys into reality, why doesn\u2019t Silicon Valley try to solve our energy problems. Without that solution none of these fantasies will see the light of day. \u2014 Dave Dreyer on The Times\u2019 Facebook page, responding to an article about tech start-ups and aerospace firms vying to create flying cars.  6. I want to see Trump\u2019s tax returns more than ever. I want to see exactly how these tax cuts benefit him. For that matter, let\u2019s get the tax returns from everyone in the Trump family, the Trump administration and Congress. I also need to know what these tax cuts will cost this country in terms of indebtedness to foreign banks. There is no free lunch when it comes to taxes. \u2014 L in California, reacting to an article about President Trump\u2019s tax plan. This comment received more than 3,700 reader recommendations. 7. Living in New York City, my wife and I end up with a net of about 48 percent after federal, state, local and city Taxes, not to mention the 3.8 percent net investment tax and the .9 percent additional tax for ACHA. Yes, we might be fortunate for making quite a bit. I am terribly tired about the \u201cFair Share\u201d argument. I will likely use [my] moderate windfall to pay for house improvements, thereby contributing to others and the economy as a whole. Trump\u2019s plan might not be the best and there are significant flaws to the initial approach, but something has to give. Skip the populism and think rationally. \u2014 JS in New York. This comment received more than 30 reader responses. 8. When it comes to the ability of our government agencies to deliver the basics, such as reliable forms of transportation, we are forced to re-think long held assumptions. We can no longer assume that the day to day schlep of life will not include such things as being stuck on a train in a tunnel for hours on end or a bridge failure that leaves cars or trains crashing to the mud flats below. Either find a way to make rail transportation reliable or repurpose the railroad real estate for highways that could accommodate a million self driving electric cars, or something else new and better. \u2014 Billy in New York, reacting to an article about Amtrak\u2019s plan to close tracks at New York Pennsylvania Station for repairs, inconveniencing commuters.  9. For most of my life, I was in the camp that rarely uses salt while cooking and never at the table. However, I have recently found that using salt while cooking is essential for great food. It is very true that you need less while cooking than you do afterward. However, that is not the only or even the most important reason to salt while cooking. Salt changes how something cooks. I became a much better cook after I started learning how to properly salt foods during cooking, and I have much more to learn. It is definitely the most important ingredient. \u2014 Ali Litts in Oregon, reacting to an article about the importance of salt in cooking.  This comment received more than 90 reader recommendations.  10. I feel as though I would be an excellent addition. I only need a folding chair, a cot, and a sandwich every six hours. \u2014 Amy Miller on The Times\u2019 Facebook page, responding to an article about The Museum of Failure, which is dedicated to chronicling products that \"did not lead to their expected outcome.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/insider/are-we-building-upon-a-legacy-or-destroying-one.html", "published_date": "2017-04-28T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Times Insider", "updated_date": "2017-04-29T05:00:08-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-29T05:00:08-04:00", "abstract": "Our Top 10 Comments of the Week: Readers debate an admission fee for non-locals at the Met, the French election results and flying cars.", "title": "'Are We Building Upon a Legacy or Destroying One?\u2019"}
