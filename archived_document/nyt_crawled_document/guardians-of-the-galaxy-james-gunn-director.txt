{"text": "James Gunn has a few problems with Hollywood. The whole category of midbudget features, he says, has evaporated, leaving only tent-pole films and franchise movies that emphasize high-tech effects over narrative and whose release dates are set long before a script is written. \u201cThe idea of cinema is dying in so many ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the things that are put out by studios just to make money, which is murdering our industry.\u201d Valid though these complaints may be, they are surprising to hear from Mr. Gunn, the director of \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d the Marvel space adventure film about a group of misfit heroes that, with a sarcastic, self-aware sense of humor (and a cast led by Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana), became one of the biggest films of 2014, grossing more than $770 million worldwide. Now, of course, that movie has spawned its own franchise, with a sequel, \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\u201d opening Friday, May 5, that is expected to prove even more astronomically lucrative than its predecessor. So it says a lot about Mr. Gunn, 46, who came to Hollywood by way of small-town Manchester, Mo., and a career in B-movies, that he believes he can resist the worst impulses of the studio system even while he works within it. To his mind, the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d movies are still fulfilling his urge to tell stories about characters with complex, interconnected needs \u2014 even if one of those characters happens to be a talking raccoon \u2014 and to maintain the innovative traditions of his moviemaking forebears, at price tags upward of $170 million. Thinking back to the moment when he was offered the first \u201cGuardians,\u201d Mr. Gunn said recently in a phone interview from his home in Malibu, \u201cI saw it as an opportunity. I could truly fill a hole of what was missing.\u201d Mr. Pratt, who was elevated from a TV sitcom star to an A-list film actor with help from the first \u201cGuardians,\u201d said that project allowed \u201cJames to earn Marvel\u2019s trust, so that he could really make the movie that he\u2019s always wanted to make. \u201cThey provide the capital for this kind of a movie, and he does everything else.\u201d Mr. Gunn, a former disciple of Lloyd Kaufman, the schlock-movie impresario and Troma Entertainment co-founder, wrote that company\u2019s outrageous Shakespeare sendup \u201cTromeo and Juliet\u201d with Mr. Kaufman, then graduated to studio projects like \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d and the live-action \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d movies. After writing and directing the sci-fi horror pastiche \u201cSlither\u201d in 2006 and the violent superhero comedy \u201cSuper\u201d in 2010, Mr. Gunn said he knew he was on Marvel\u2019s list of directors for \u201cGuardians,\u201d though not high on it. Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, said that Mr. Gunn \u201cwas a name amongst many,\u201d but added that \u201cthe secret of our list is, they\u2019re not listed in order of preference.\u201d \u201cIt really is based on the vibe of the meetings and discussions we have,\u201d Mr. Feige said, \u201cthat we come to our decision of who we want to collaborate and live with for many years to come.\u201d Given that \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d was based on a Marvel comic that was not especially popular at the time, filled with low-level characters who you wouldn\u2019t even ask to cater an Avengers staff party, perhaps Mr. Gunn was ideally suited for the material. After one preliminary meeting with Marvel producers, Mr. Gunn could not quite get over the character of Rocket Raccoon, a bad-tempered, gun-toting anthropomorphic animal with the voice of Bradley Cooper. \u201cI was like, \u2018O.K., a talking raccoon \u2013 that\u2019s a stupid idea,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gunn recalled. \u201cBut let\u2019s say there was a talking raccoon. How would he exist?\u201d Once he connected to the \u201cextraordinary sadness\u201d of the character\u2019s Frankenstein-like origins, Mr. Gunn said, \u201cit drove the whole thing for me, and I found it tonally interesting because of that.\u201d To him, the first \u201cGuardians\u201d presented a chance to reinvigorate the drab, dreary space-opera genre with the buoyancy of favorite films like \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d and the gaudy colors of \u201cFlash Gordon.\u201d The assignment came with many conditions, including a cast of characters who had to be established within the first 20 minutes, like Peter Quill (Mr. Pratt), a would-be outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord; and Gamora (Ms. Saldana), a green-skinned alien assassin. There was an existing script by Nicole Perlman and a preset release date, leaving Mr. Gunn little time to make changes. (He and Ms. Perlman shared screenplay credit on the film.) Mr. Feige said he knew he\u2019d made the right choice when he saw what was on the cover of Mr. Gunn\u2019s revised script treatment: A color photo of a vintage Walkman, a personal artifact treasured by Peter Quill, who uses it to play his favorite classic-rock songs. \u201cBefore I even turned the page,\u201d Mr. Feige said, \u201cI thought, \u2018This is perfect.\u2019\u201d Ms. Saldana describes herself as \u201ca sucker for sci-fi\u201d (she also plays Uhura in the current \u201cStar Trek\u201d franchise), but said she often finds such screenplays challenging to read. \u201cFirst of all, I think in Spanish,\u201d she explained, \u201cand I\u2019m dyslexic.\u201d But in early conversations with Mr. Gunn, she said, \u201cI felt in his tone, his confidence, that he knew exactly what he was going to do.\u201d Mr. Gunn, she said, represented \u201cwhat is great about being a geek,\u201d adding, \u201cIt just means that you\u2019re curious, you\u2019re confident, and once you make a discovery, you show it off with pride.\u201d Mr. Gunn found making movies on a megabudget Marvel scale invigorating \u2014 \u201cOn my last movie, I did 54 setups a day with one camera, so this is easy,\u201d he said \u2014 but also intimidating. \u201cI would wake up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. thinking I might be making \u2018Pluto Nash 2,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to Eddie Murphy\u2019s costly outer-space flop from 2002. \u201cThere were moments where I was consoling myself with the thought that I could go teach.\u201d That said, the success of the movie \u2014 which was a hit not only with audiences but with critics, and enjoys a 91 percent positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes \u2014 bought a lot of leeway for Mr. Gunn, who started writing a second \u201cGuardians\u201d film as soon as the first one was released. \u201cI got to start from scratch with the story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emotional and action plots were completely intertwined, and all organic and one thing.\u201d Asked if Marvel dictated any plot elements this time, Mr. Gunn said: \u201cNone. Zero.\u201d (Mr. Feige said, \u201cThe notion that we require things or crowbar things into one movie so it serves another\u201d was \u201coverblown.\u201d) \u201cThe only restrictions this time are things that we set up in the last movie,\u201d he added. \u201cOther than that, it can go anywhere we want it to.\u201d Mr. Pratt said that when they met to talk about \u201cVol. 2,\u201d soon after the first \u201cGuardians\u201d opened, Mr. Gunn was deeply concerned about repeating himself. On the original film, Mr. Pratt said, \u201cwe benefited from people\u2019s lowered expectations. We could sneak in and be this movie that they didn\u2019t see coming. Now they\u2019re waiting in line for this. \u201cSo how do you surprise somebody who\u2019s lying in wait? He did that by just throwing away the formula of the first movie.\u201d For \u201cVol. 2,\u201d Mr. Gunn immersed himself in sources as disparate as the artwork of Jim Steranko, a comic-book illustrator known for his surrealism, psychedelia and sensuality; and the visually sumptuous movies of Wong Kar-wai. He came away inspired to add characters like Ego, a living planet who is revealed to be Quill\u2019s father and who, in his humanoid form, is played by Kurt Russell. What connects Ego to the established \u201cGuardians\u201d ensemble, Mr. Gunn said, are themes of isolation and yearning to belong. \u201cAt the center of this was a lonely being who had been floating out there for eons,\u201d he said, \u201cdreaming if other life exists out there somewhere.\u201d Mr. Gunn\u2019s name also appeared earlier this year on \u201cThe Belko Experiment,\u201d a gruesome thriller about an office complex in Colombia whose employees are forced to murder each other. Mr. Gunn wrote the screenplay and had been preparing to direct it many years ago, but withdrew when he and the actress Jenna Fischer were divorcing in 2008. \u201cSuddenly, I was like, \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t want to make a movie about people who are killing each other,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gunn recalled. When MGM and Orion Pictures revived \u201cThe Belko Experiment,\u201d Mr. Gunn stayed on as a producer. \u201cFor me it was mostly an excuse to take time off and hang with all my actor friends who I put in the movie,\u201d he said. He explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an edgy, violence thing in me, that maybe I need to scratch, whether that\u2019s healthy or not.\u201d But since he started working on the \u201cGuardians\u201d movies, Mr. Gunn said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve changed a lot in what stories I want to tell, through this process. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for me to go to the cheap shock. In some ways, it\u2019s an emotional cover-up, as opposed to feeling sadness or dealing with the more vulnerable side of my nature.\u201d Mr. Gunn has already announced he plans to write and direct a third \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d film, and said that working on any other established franchise would probably feel too constrictive. When Marvel first sought him out, he said, \u201cI kind of did want to make a \u2018Hulk\u2019 movie, but at this point, that isn\u2019t what I would want to do. Working in that \u2018Avengers\u2019 thing, you have to work within a pre-existing system. It\u2019s more exciting to me to create something new.\u201d He added: \u201cI have a story of a raccoon I need to tell right now. Nothing else really appeals to me. I love the raccoon as much as I love my family members.\u201d", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/movies/guardians-of-the-galaxy-james-gunn-director.html", "published_date": "2017-04-26T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Movies", "updated_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:40-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-27T05:00:40-04:00", "abstract": "The director wasn\u2019t sold on the idea at first. \u201cA talking raccoon \u2014 that\u2019s a stupid idea,\u201d he thought.
