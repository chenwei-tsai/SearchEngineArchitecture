{"abstract": "Virginia Johnson of Dance Theater of Harlem wanted a modern work for her ballet dancers to tackle. She found one under her own roof, space shared by the Lim\u00f3n company.", "item_type": "Article", "text": "\u201cModern dance,\u201d the choreographer Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n wrote in 1965, \u201cis not a \u2018popular art.\u2019\u201d Nor is it an advertiser\u2019s dream. \u201cA pretty ballerina in a pert tutu and pink toe shoe,\u201d he continued, \u201cis a much more fetching sales pitch than a vision of a barefoot dancer in a species of ecstasy or suffering.\u201d But for Dance Theater of Harlem\u2019s City Center season, beginning Wednesday, Virginia Johnson, the company\u2019s artistic director, wants her ballet dancers to brush up against some of that ecstasy and suffering. The Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n Dance Foundation operates out of Dance Theater of Harlem\u2019s headquarters. So when Ms. Johnson decided that she wanted to have a classic modern work in the repertory, it was natural for her settle on a Lim\u00f3n piece, \u201cChaconne,\u201d which he created as a solo for himself in 1942. Set to Bach\u2019s Violin Partita No. 2 in D minor, it is stately, introspective and lushly seamless. Ballet dancers are capable of expressing those qualities, of course. What\u2019s trickier for them to grasp is the way weight is used in modern dance. Instead of airiness, they must dig into the floor, as well as master the contraction and release of the pelvis to attain an entirely new way of holding the body. Ms. Johnson relishes the simplicity and power of \u201cChaconne.\u201d She said: \u201cIt\u2019s formal, it\u2019s personal, it\u2019s modern and it\u2019s classical \u2014 it\u2019s all of these things that I want our dancers to have in their toolbox. And it\u2019s something that I want people to see: That this is what dancing can do.\u201d In its purest form, \u201cChaconne\u201d is a solo. It will be performed that way on Friday by Dylan Santos, but for opening night it has been reconfigured for five dancers \u2014 three from Dance Theater and two from the Lim\u00f3n company. Last Thursday, the cast gathered in a studio with Ms. Johnson, the Dance Theater ballet master Keith Saunders and the Lim\u00f3n company\u2019s artistic director, Colin Connor. For the expanded \u201cChaconne,\u201d each dancer performs a solo, etching the space with Lim\u00f3n\u2019s voluptuous turns, both fleet and slowly curving, and weightier moments of stillness in which stoic poses are embellished with sculptural touches, like the arms held overhead with the backs of the wrists touching. Eventually, like a flock of birds, they swirl the stage in unison and land on individual spots. \u201cThere\u2019s something really nice about it building with one person and then another, and then ending up together at the end,\u201d Mr. Connor said. \u201cI love the idea that they each get to wear it like it\u2019s a piece of clothing they can pass on to one another.\u201d The reconfigured work will begin with the elegant Dance Theater member Jorge Andr\u00e9s Villarini, followed by Logan Frances Kruger of Lim\u00f3n, Mr. Santos, Ross Katen of Lim\u00f3n and Stephanie Rae Williams of Dance Theater. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Mr. Connor said after a run at the rehearsal. \u201cYou guys are harmonizing.\u201d \u201cChaconne\u201d was staged by Gary Masters, a former Lim\u00f3n dancer and reconstructor of his pieces, who worked with the companies separately and together. (The Lim\u00f3n company has its own season at the Joyce Theater, starting May 2.) \u201cIt seemed like a great chance for us to all be in the same room together and to function more collaboratively,\u201d Mr. Connor said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to some of the dancers who are doing it for Dance Theater of Harlem, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019ve never had to dance anything like this before.\u2019 It requires your total entire human engagement. It\u2019s a gloriously daunting solo.\u201d That appealed to Ms. Johnson, who called \u201cChaconne\u201d an \u201cexercise in artistry.\u201d She said she liked the idea of a shared voice, and appreciated the Lim\u00f3n company\u2019s being in Dance Theater\u2019s space because of the aesthetic that the modern group brings. \u201cIn ballet, we go so much to the surface,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, we have a company that is so grounded and operating on a different kind of purpose in making dance \u2014 it\u2019s a reminder that you should consider other things.\u201d As for the solo itself? \u201cThis is understanding that you have a purpose on the stage and that you need to find a way to fulfill it,\u201d she said. \u201cI looked for dancers who had access to an interior life that could inform the quietness of the piece, that would bring that kind of weight to it.\u201d Contained at first, \u201cChaconne\u201d grows from simple elements to full-bodied expression. \u201cIt spreads its energy into space and almost creates light in some kind of way,\u201d Mr. Connor said. \u201cI think Jos\u00e9 managed to tap into this sense of existential human fight that we all have in a way that has so much life to it.\u201d One challenge is holding the stage in what Mr. Connor described as \u201cnaked dancing.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to hide in the solo; it has a formality to it that emphasizes line, but it also deals with the idea of building momentum. Mr. Santos said he had to find a way to understand that the positions in the work are more than poses, but feelings. \u201cI started paying attention to everything happening around me \u2014 what makes me happy, what makes me sad, what makes me do better, what makes me not be in a bad mood and not do my best,\u201d he said. \u201cThe solo started unfolding in front of my face. When I perform it, I don\u2019t even see anyone else in the room. I\u2019ve never felt like this ever dancing anything else. Any dancer should have the chance to do it once.\u201d The importance of \u201cChaconne\u201d goes beyond the obvious differences between modern dance and ballet. \u201cEvery step has to keep being true to what you\u2019re feeling in that moment,\u201d Mr. Santos said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally about being a human being and not being afraid to feel what you feel.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/arts/dance/ballet-dancers-get-naked-emotionally-in-a-modern-limon-work.html", "source": "The New York Times", "updated_date": "2017-04-18T15:38:10-04:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "published_date": "2017-04-17T20:00:00-04:00", "title": "Ballet Dancers Get Naked (Emotionally) in a Modern Lim\u00f3n Work", "created_date": "2017-04-18T15:38:10-04:00", "section": "Arts"}
