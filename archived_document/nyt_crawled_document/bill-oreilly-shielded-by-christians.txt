{"text": "Institutions plagued by sexual assault scandals tend to look alike: They are usually insular organizations that resist external checks and revolve around authoritative men. This characterization fits Fox News, which recently fired its host Bill O\u2019Reilly after sexual harassment allegations against him (and pressure from advertisers) mounted. But it is also applies to the white evangelical Christian community. This group is not a monolith, but its social hierarchy often functions like the military, a university or private business. It\u2019s not a coincidence that conservative evangelical leaders tend to resist taking harassment and assault claims seriously. Eric Metaxas, a best-selling Christian author, tweeted after the firing that Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ouster was \u201ctremendously sad\u201d and that his show had been a \u201cblessing to millions.\u201d When people responding to his tweet noted that he was silent on the harassment itself, he wrote \u201cJesus loves Bill O\u2019Reilly\u201d and told his followers to pray for their enemies. Many Christian leaders responded to Donald Trump\u2019s bragging about sexual assault with a similar line of defense. Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, the country\u2019s largest Christian college, said that \u201cwe\u2019re all sinners\u201d and that Mr. Trump had apologized. (In fact, Mr. Trump has said that he doesn\u2019t ask God for forgiveness and didn\u2019t need to ask his wife for it either.) Mr. Falwell later claimed to have proof that the women accusing Mr. Trump of sexual harassment were lying. David Brody, a correspondent with the Christian Broadcasting Network, excused Mr. Trump\u2019s language at the time by saying, \u201cWe all sin every single day.\u201d Jim Garlow, a prominent California pastor, refused to \u201ccast any stones\u201d at Mr. Trump, invoking Jesus\u2019 teaching in the Gospel of John. He then called Hillary Clinton a modern-day Herod who would kill all the unborn babies if elected. Within the ranks of conservative church leadership, this default empathy for powerful men is coupled with tone deafness for victims. But the phenomenon is also a misapplication of the Christian teaching on forgiveness. Mr. Metaxas wrote a biography of the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, so he is surely familiar with his teaching on cheap grace \u2014 \u201cthe preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance.\u201d Cheap grace wrongly separates absolution of sin from acknowledgment of that sin. In Christian teaching, God forgives people before they confess wrongdoing. But among individuals, groups and nations, there can be no forgiveness when wrongdoing isn\u2019t named. In cases of sexual assault, cheap grace is doubly dangerous: It can allow a guilty party to continue his abuse while victims stay silent in fear of punishment. In churches, a quick forgiveness for perpetrators often dovetails with strict standards of purity for women. From a young age, many Christian women are taught to dress modestly so as not to cause men to \u201cstumble.\u201d John Piper, a prominent pastor and theologian, has said that \u201ca lot of Christian women are oblivious to the fact that they have some measure of responsibility\u201d in managing men\u2019s lust. The moralizing about dress and behavior can be a setup for victim-blaming wrapped in a spiritual veneer. Perhaps churches have been slow to address sex crimes out of a belief that such offenses couldn\u2019t happen among their own. It\u2019s assumed that the culture of harassment at a place like Fox News would never come to infect a community serving God. This thinking is both na\u00efve and theologically irresponsible: Christians, of all people, acknowledge the depths of human depravity. In recent years, undeniable scandals at Bob Jones University, Sovereign Grace Church and Bill Gothard\u2019s family ministry, among others, have awakened many conservative Christians to the reality of sexual assault in their own ranks. Boz Tchividjian, a grandson of the evangelist Billy Graham, is a law professor who runs Grace (Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment). While the organization focuses on child abuse, Mr. Tchividjian speaks regularly on sex crimes in general. He critiques Christian organizations that respond to abuse with \u201cinstitutional self-protection,\u201d often by couching self-protection as \u201cprotecting the name of Christ.\u201d If conservative Christians want to protect the faith \u2014 especially in a time when they fear loss of cultural power \u2014 they must show preferential care not for the powerful but for victims. They must be just as quick to extend empathy to women who have been harassed as they are to extend forgiveness to harassers. This is the hard work that epitomizes Dietrich Bonhoeffer\u2019s conception of \u201ccostly grace.\u201d An application of costly grace would mean showing perpetrators that their actions have real consequences. It would also ensure that victims are heard and given tools for healing long before there is any talk of restoring their abusers.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/opinion/bill-oreilly-shielded-by-christians.html", "published_date": "2017-05-01T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Opinion", "updated_date": "2017-05-02T03:22:21-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "Op-Ed", "created_date": "2017-05-02T03:21:10-04:00", "abstract": "In many conservative churches, the default is to defer to powerful men and blame their victims.", "title": "The Mistake Christians Made in Defending Bill O\u2019Reilly"}
