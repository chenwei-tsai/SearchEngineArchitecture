{"text": "What\u2019s the best way to connect with our readers? Meet them face-to-face. On Saturday, Aug. 8, the @nytimes Instagram team hosted its first meet-up in Hunts Point, a neighborhood in the Bronx. David Gonzalez \u2014 a Metro-desk columnist, co-editor of the Lens blog and our resident graffiti chronicler \u2014 led a group of Instagrammers on a walk to see graffiti and street art in the area. Along the way, everyone stopped to take pictures. (This was, after all, a group of photography enthusiasts.) This is the first event the @nytimes Instagram team has hosted since the account launched in early March. Typically known as \u201cInstameets,\u201d gatherings like this are meant to celebrate community. For photographers, though, it\u2019s uncommon to travel in a pack. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to be taking photographs \u2014 the same photographs that everyone else is taking,\u201d said Jim Estrin, a staff photographer and co-editor of the Lens blog. But Jim \u2014 and the 19 other people shooting with smartphones \u2014 managed just fine. Find photos uploaded by the group on Instagram at #NYTBronxWalk. Some Instagrammers focused on shooting the walls themselves, while others preferred to use the art as a backdrop for street scenes and daily life pictures. Diversity in photographic style was important to us. When we started building our guest list, we began by reaching out to Instagrammers dedicated to capturing street art and the Bronx \u2014 or in many cases, both. One of our invitees, Martha Cooper, has been photographing street art around the world since the 1970s. Another, Lois Stavsky, keeps a blog about New York City street art. And Rhynna Santos helps run @everydaybronx, an Instagram feed that celebrates life in the borough. We were eager to meet some of our @nytimes Instagram followers so we reserved some spots on the tour for them too. Before our walk, we invited our followers to post their photos of street art and graffiti using the hashtag #NYTBronxWalk. We tagged the photos and chose a few Instagrammers whose work caught our eye \u2014 in many cases, for its fresh perspective on street art. More than half of the Instagrammers who joined us were invited based on their participation in our callout. #NYTBronxWalk attendees got to see more than murals along the way. Early in our walk, John \u201cCrash\u201d Matos, a frequent collaborator with the TATS CRU, came by to answer questions about his work and talk about the history of graffiti. And to wrap up the morning, we watched muralists paint a life-size recreation of a subway car at The Point. \u201cThe wall you\u2019re seeing being painted right now?\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said as the group shot the subway car. \u201cBy next week, there\u2019ll be a new one going up.\u201d Stay tuned for future @nytimes Instagram events. We hope there will be many #instameets to come.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/insider/an-instagram-walkabout-in-the-bronx.html", "published_date": "2015-08-16T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "The New York Times", "created_date": "2017-04-21T15:42:07-04:00", "abstract": "Recently, The Times invited some of its Instagram followers to join photo editors in capturing street scenes in the Bronx.", "title": "An Instagram Walkabout in the Bronx", "material_type_facet": "News", "section": "Times Insider", "item_type": "Article", "updated_date": "2017-04-21T15:42:07-04:00"}
