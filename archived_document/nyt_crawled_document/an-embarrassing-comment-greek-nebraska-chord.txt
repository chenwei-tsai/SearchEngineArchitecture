I hope so, because Gary Cee\u2019s theme is a calorie-buster, but that\u2019s O.K., because at least two of the four theme entries are modern and delicious. Mr. Cee\u2019s theme is a set of phrases where the second word is an edible. If only there were a familiar phrase whose second word was \u201cketchup.\u201d We start with a WORD SALAD, move on to the entree and side, a NOTHING BURGER and COUCH POTATOES, and end our meal with HUMBLE PIE.
