{"text": "People in New Orleans won\u2019t bat an eyelash if you put a pig\u2019s tail or feet on a plate in front of them, said Marcus Jacobs, the chef for and an owner of Marjie\u2019s Grill in Mid-City: \u201cYou can go to a gas station and buy pig\u2019s feet pretty much anywhere in town. People are open-minded about those kind of \u2018off cuts.\u2019\u201d While traveling in Southeast Asia, Mr. Jacobs and his partner and the restaurant\u2019s other owner, Caitlin Carney, who are alumni of the fine dining stalwart Herbsaint \u2014 discovered similar appetites for \u201coff cuts\u201d in Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. \u201cPeople make a lot of comparisons between the Mississippi Delta and the Mekong Delta,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said. \u201cThey\u2019re not afraid to eat weird pieces of pork. There\u2019s a lot of cultural crossover.\u201d Weird pieces of pork are indeed on the menu at Marjie\u2019s Grill, and they are sublime. During a recent visit, I could have ordered a dozen plates of pig knuckles \u2014 salty, crispy and unctuous morsels drizzled with cane syrup, down-home and decadent. I washed them down with a tropical sunset-hued cocktail called the Rad Jam made with tequila, Campari and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit (a beer and juice mixture). And if crisp, spice-dusted cracklings and supple slices of soy- and chile-glazed pork jowl are weird, who could want normal? The palatable balance of sweet, salty, spicy and acidic flavors typical of Southeast Asian cuisine pairs fabulously with Gulf ingredients, many of which are smoked, grilled or coal-roasted over a barbecue pit out back, a feature reminiscent of that at Mr. Jacobs and Ms. Carney\u2019s pop-up restaurant, Sparklehorse Grill. \u201cWe enjoyed doing pop-ups with this food but knew we could do more,\u201d she said, so they began looking for a permanent spot. They opened Marjie\u2019s Grill \u2014 named after Ms. Carney\u2019s mother \u2014 in December. At Marjie\u2019s, rich, charred ribbons of cabbage are brightened with cilantro and scallions and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. Cornmeal-coated and fried head-on Gulf shrimp are sweet and crunchy, while Mississippi beef tartare tossed with mint and cilantro and savory fried shallots is meltingly tender. Coal-roasted Gulf fish \u2014 a firm and flaky sheepshead the night I dined \u2014 is served on its blackened skin beside a bouquet of fresh, leafy herbs meant for wrapping and dipping bites of the fish into a lively, citrusy sauce. I finished things off with johnnycakes smeared with strawberry jam and topped with a sweet praline. The balance between Delta influences was all off, favoring the Mississippi and abandoning the Mekong. It was surprisingly incongruous end to an otherwise delightful meal.", "source": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/travel/marjies-grill-new-orleans-louisiana-asian-gulf-restaurant-review.html", "published_date": "2017-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "section": "Travel", "updated_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:18-04:00", "item_type": "Article", "material_type_facet": "News", "created_date": "2017-04-28T05:00:18-04:00", "abstract": "At Marjie\u2019s Grill, the balance of sweet, salty, spicy and acidic flavors typical of Southeast Asian cuisine pairs fabulously with local seafood and \u201coff cuts.\u201d", "title": "In New Orleans, Marrying Asian Influences and Gulf Ingredients"}
