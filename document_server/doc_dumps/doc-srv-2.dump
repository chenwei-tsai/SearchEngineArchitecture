S'Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone Tuesday, discussing Syria, terrorism and North Korea - as well as the possibility of a personal meeting this summer. The leaders - who have previously been at odds over the best handling of Syria - "agreed that the suffering in Syria has gone on for far too long and that all parties must do all they can to end the violence", according to a White House readout of the call. The Syria discussion included safe zones, something Trump has advocated for both as a candidate and as president, as well as future cease-fire talks to happen on May 3rd and 4th in Astana, Kazakhstan. National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton confirmed to NBC News that Trump and Putin discussed the possibility of an in person meeting.'

S'President Trump is expected to sign an executive order on religious liberty this Thursday--- which is the National Day of Prayer, senior White House sources confirmed Tuesday to Fox News. An early draft of the order, leaked in February, would have established broad exemptions for people and groups to claim religious objections under strong language. The new draft of the executive order is being tightly held, Politico reported. A person identified as an "influential conservative" by Politico who saw the text said it hasn\'t been dialed back much since the leak.'

Bret Stephens may have won a Pulitzer Prize writing for the Wall Street Journal, but subscribers flooded the phone lines to cancel their subscriptions after his debut at the Gray Lady. One thing that may have been drowned out by all the noise is that Stephens is a vehemently anti-Trump voice, which should appeal to readers of the mostly liberal op-ed page. Stephens said during the campaign, for instance, that he wanted Trump to lose by such a wide margin that "the Republican Party, the Republican voters learn their lesson that they cannot nominate a man so manifestly unqualified to be president in any way, shape, or form.'

"It\'s a feeling like they are breaking every bone of every joint in your body at the same time," he said. Anzor is a gay man from Chechnya, the predominantly Muslim region in southern Russia where dozens of men suspected of being gay were reportedly detained and tortured, and at least three of them were allegedly killed.'

Benjamin Alire S\xc3\xa1enz deftly portrays the way adolescents deal with grief in his latest novel for young adults, The Inexplicable Logic of My Life (Clarion Books, 2017). The noted author and poet - he is the winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award and the American Book Award - has built on the success of his first book for young adult readers, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (2014). The protagonist is Salvador Silva who, like most seniors in high school, is looking forward to the next phase of his academic journey though he knows he's the atypical 17-year-old."

"The court therefore must declare a mistrial in this case and I so declare that this case is mistried," he said after the jury returned to the room and confirmed their decision.

The series follows the lives of college radio host Samantha White and her friends as they fight back against microaggressions and sometimes outright racism at Winchester College, a (fictional) predominantly white Ivy League school. Through satirical wit and unflinching candor the show tackles subjects like blackface and police violence - all while peeling back layers of racial self-identity. Simien said he felt inspired to continue the story because so much of how the world sees black and minority America is pre-defined by stereotypes."

They note it\'s the only special election this year in a district Democrats have held until fairly recently, and also the only one where there is a sizable black electorate. "We can do this," Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told South Carolina Democrats this weekend of flipping the district - which had been represented by a Republican, Mick Mulvaney, who joined the Trump administration as budget director - at a party fundraiser in Columbia.'

As Trump himself defended the package, the administration dispatched top officials to make their case.

S"Police in Bangladesh said on Tuesday they had arrested the IT chief of a banned militant Islamist group that has been blamed for the killing of several secular bloggers and gay rights activists. The suspected militant, identified as Ashfaqur Rahman, worked as the IT head of the al Qaeda-inspired militant group Ansarullah Bangla Team, the chief of Bangladesh's counter-terrorism police, Monirul Islam, told a news conference. Rahman was arrested late on Monday in the capital, Dhaka, he added, as the handcuffed man was paraded before the media. Islam said Rahman was a close aide of the group's head of military operations, former army major Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque, who went into hiding after the Bangladesh military accused him of involvement in a plot to topple the government in 2011."
