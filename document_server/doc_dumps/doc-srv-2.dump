S'Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone Tuesday, discussing Syria, terrorism and North Korea - as well as the possibility of a personal meeting this summer. The leaders - who have previously been at odds over the best handling of Syria - "agreed that the suffering in Syria has gone on for far too long and that all parties must do all they can to end the violence", according to a White House readout of the call. The Syria discussion included safe zones, something Trump has advocated for both as a candidate and as president, as well as future cease-fire talks to happen on May 3rd and 4th in Astana, Kazakhstan. National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton confirmed to NBC News that Trump and Putin discussed the possibility of an in person meeting.'

S'President Trump is expected to sign an executive order on religious liberty this Thursday--- which is the National Day of Prayer, senior White House sources confirmed Tuesday to Fox News. An early draft of the order, leaked in February, would have established broad exemptions for people and groups to claim religious objections under strong language. The new draft of the executive order is being tightly held, Politico reported. A person identified as an "influential conservative" by Politico who saw the text said it hasn\'t been dialed back much since the leak.'

The Tuesday afternoon budget dealing characterizations swung from forceful characterization of a White House win on border security and existing border wall repairs to a roasting of Democrats for celebrating their own legislative priorities in the bill.

That can be frustrating to a solver, but hopefully the payoff of a humorous quip makes up for the extra hunting. Today\'s quip by Alan Arbesfeld might not be that well-known as far as I can tell, but if you like puns and other kinds of "groaner" jokes, the payoff is definitely there. And by the time you work your way down to the punch line at 53A, you might even be able to guess the quip as a whole.'

Bret Stephens may have won a Pulitzer Prize writing for the Wall Street Journal, but subscribers flooded the phone lines to cancel their subscriptions after his debut at the Gray Lady. One thing that may have been drowned out by all the noise is that Stephens is a vehemently anti-Trump voice, which should appeal to readers of the mostly liberal op-ed page. Stephens said during the campaign, for instance, that he wanted Trump to lose by such a wide margin that "the Republican Party, the Republican voters learn their lesson that they cannot nominate a man so manifestly unqualified to be president in any way, shape, or form.'

S"One Mississippi family's pain and grief after losing a loved one was compounded when the local funeral home suddenly refused to perform their relative's cremation because he was gay. Robert Huskey passed away in May 2016 after his heart condition worsened over the previous year. Knowing that his death was imminent, Huskey's nephew had made arrangements with the local funeral home the month before his passing. But according to a lawsuit announced Tuesday by Lambda Legal, the Picayune Funeral Home suddenly refused to pick up and cremate Huskey's body as planned on the day of his death."

The Philadelphia City Council voted Monday to change handlers of its $2 billion payroll account, according to published reports. Instead of continuing the arrangement with embattled Wells Fargo, the city chose to hire Citizens Bank for the next fiscal year starting in July. The move comes under the dark cloud that has enveloped Wells since the second-largest bank by assets in the U.'

The noted author and poet - he is the winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award and the American Book Award - has built on the success of his first book for young adult readers, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (2014).

The series follows the lives of college radio host Samantha White and her friends as they fight back against microaggressions and sometimes outright racism at Winchester College, a (fictional) predominantly white Ivy League school. Through satirical wit and unflinching candor the show tackles subjects like blackface and police violence - all while peeling back layers of racial self-identity. Simien said he felt inspired to continue the story because so much of how the world sees black and minority America is pre-defined by stereotypes."

S'Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones on Tuesday challenged the unknown Boston Red Sox fan who yelled a racial slur at him to "square up - let\'s fight and get it over with." Jones confirmed remarks attributed to him in USA Today, telling reporters at a news conference Tuesday that the vitriol grew so hostile during Monday night\'s game at Boston\'s Fenway Park that at one point, a bag of peanuts was thrown at him while he was on the field. "I heard the N-word," Jones said Tuesday, a day after the Orioles beat the Red Sox, 5-2. "It was not clever.'

S'The controversy over Palestinian Authority payments to convicted terrorists and their families is expected to be a top priority when President Trump meets with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas at the White House on Wednesday, Fox News is told. "Stopping the payment of terrorist families is a priority for this administration and this president, and a necessary foundation for real peace," a senior administration official said. "We expect the president will make this point in the meeting." The role of the payments, which has gained prominence in recent days, has outraged lawmakers who have pointed to the case of American terrorism victim Taylor Force as a prime example of what they charge is the Palestinian Authority\'s support for terror attacks against civilians.'

S'Senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway reacted to comments made Tuesday by Hillary Clinton that blamed FBI Director James Comey and Russian interference for aiding Republican rival Donald Trump\'s ascension to the presidency. Conway said in a Tweet to Clinton that "You Ignored WI, Called us deplorable/irredeemable, Had oodles of $$ & no message, Lost to a better candidate," signing it "From: Woman in the White House." In her comments earlier Tuesday, Clinton specifically cited the letter from Comey late in the campaign saying agents were looking into possible new information related to Clinton\'s secret, homebrewed computer server. She was ultimately never charged with a crime, and Comey cleared Clinton on the Sunday before the election.'

S'The Trump administration launched a full-court press Tuesday to defend the controversial $1 trillion-plus budget deal, after Democrats claimed victory in negotiations and conservatives claimed GOP leaders gave too much ground. Critics complained that the deal announced Monday to avert a government shutdown would keep funding for Planned Parenthood and so-called "sanctuary cities" without funding President Trump\'s promised border wall. As Trump himself defended the package, the administration dispatched top officials to make their case. In a lively presentation during the White House briefing Tuesday afternoon -- and armed with visual aids -- White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said this was no victory for Democrats.'

S"Police in Bangladesh said on Tuesday they had arrested the IT chief of a banned militant Islamist group that has been blamed for the killing of several secular bloggers and gay rights activists. The suspected militant, identified as Ashfaqur Rahman, worked as the IT head of the al Qaeda-inspired militant group Ansarullah Bangla Team, the chief of Bangladesh's counter-terrorism police, Monirul Islam, told a news conference. Rahman was arrested late on Monday in the capital, Dhaka, he added, as the handcuffed man was paraded before the media. Islam said Rahman was a close aide of the group's head of military operations, former army major Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque, who went into hiding after the Bangladesh military accused him of involvement in a plot to topple the government in 2011."
