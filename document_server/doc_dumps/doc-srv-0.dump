S'As Democrats hunt for the 24 seats they need win back the House next year, a congressional district in Miami just shot to the top of their list thanks to Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen\'s decision to retire from a seat she\'s held for nearly three decades. Longtime incumbents often chose to step aside ahead of an election that they expect to be tougher than usual, so Democrats hope Ros-Lehtinen\'s move is an early sign of a coming Democratic wave election, though she says the decision was purely "personal." Florida\'s 27th Congressional District voted for Hillary Clinton by 20 percentage points - a larger margin than any other district in the country held by a Republican.'

According to Telemundo, a Los Angeles judge issued a warrant for the singer's arrest on April 17 for repeatedly refusing to appear before a court for the case involving his former manager William Brockhaus. Brockhaus acted as a representative for Luis Miguel between 2013 and 2015, and claims that Luis Miguel didn't pull through on a compensation agreement."

The Detroit-based music publishers for Eminem are suing New Zealand\'s conservative National Party, alleging the soundtrack for a 2014 election campaign ad copied the rapper\'s acclaimed 2002 song. Titled "Eminem Esque," the track has the familiar urgent, pulsing beat of the original.

In an interview Monday with Bloomberg News, Trump said he is "looking at that right now." Bank stocks rallied, with investors taking a win-win view: Breaking up the big banks would open business opportunities for smaller institutions, while the large Wall Street firms would be worth more as separate entities than they are combined. "The theory has always been the sum of the parts is worth considerably more than the whole," said analyst Dick Bove, vice president for equity research at Rafferty Capital Markets.'

A group of scientists has compiled a new atlas of some of those formations and released images from the collection on Tuesday (April 25) at the annual meeting of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna. The 200-plus images in the "Atlas of Submarine Glacial Landforms" reveal the "fingerprints" that past glaciers and ice sheets left on the seafloor, Kelly Hogan, a marine geophysicist with the British Antarctic Survey, told reporters during a news conference.'

Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war in which rebel forces are trying to remove President Bashar Assad, whose regime is backed by the Kremlin. Trump recently took a hard line on Assad for using chemical weapons on civilians in rebel territory -- and bombed an airstrip from which the civilian attacks were launched.

S"The Justice Department does not plan to bring charges in the fatal police shooting of an African-American man who was shot during a confrontation outside a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convenience store last year, two sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News. Sources said prosecutors have concluded there isn't enough evidence to bring civil rights charges in the July 5, 2016, death of Alton Sterling, 37, whose death was captured on video and sparked days of protests in Louisiana's second-biggest city. Sterling was shot by police as he was on the ground after being tackled by police officers outside the store, where he was selling CDs. Authorities said they were looking for a man matching Sterling's description who had threatened someone with a gun, and that Sterling was armed and allegedly tried to reach for the weapon."

S'American University is investigating after bananas scrawled with racist messages were found hanging from fixtures around the Washington D.C. campus Monday morning. The bananas, strung up in black noose-like rope, were marked with the words "Harambe bait" - a reference to the lowland gorilla who was shot at the Cincinnati zoo to protect a boy who fell into his enclosure and instantly became the subject of popular memes, some of which took on racist connotations - and "AKA free" in reference to Alpha Kappa Alpha, a predominantly Black sorority, and were found in three different places on campus.'

S"A man and woman were arrested on Sunday in connection with a motel shooting that police believe was part of a cross-city rampage throughout the Los Angeles suburbs - killing one person and wounding at least three others. The shooting spree, spanning multiple cities, began when an armed Hispanic man and a Hispanic female accomplice forced their way into a woman's green SUV in Pico Rivera on Saturday afternoon, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said. The man then shot at another person a block away in the neighboring community of Whittier, police said, before opening fire in four other nearby locations in the towns of La Mirada and Norwalk. The victim in the Whittier shooting, identified as 33-year-old Jose Sahagun of Norwalk by the Coroner's Office, was transported to a local hospital and has died, police said."

Since the Republicans' failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, MacArthur has nearly single-handedly breathed new life into an effort that could culminate in a vote on the GOP measure this week. But while the fight over health care has played out as political high drama in the halls of power in Washington, for MacArthur it's also a personal battle stemming from the loss of his 11-year-old daughter nearly two decades ago."

For some, that cellphone video from inside Missha Beauty in Charlotte, North Carolina, rekindled memories of the 1990s, a time of tense relations between Korean store owners and black customers in cities like New York and Los Angeles. "Here I am, really trying to help reshape the narrative that has been told and trying to create bridges of understanding," said the 50-year-old Im.'

The hack or hackers - who go by "thedarkoverlord" - said they had demanded a "modest" ransom from Netflix to stop the leak, "yet they continue to remain unresponsive." "With this information in mind (and the fact that leaving people on cliffhangers isn\'t fun) we\'ve decided to release Episodes 2-10 of \'Orange Is The New Black\' Season 5 after many lengthy discussions at the office where alcohol was present," the group said on an online computer code sharing site. The industry site Torrentfreak reported that "thedarkoverlord" also released the season premiere.'

From 2008 until February 2016, she was president of Americans United for Life, which campaigned at the federal and state level for tough restrictions on abortion. Among the many state bills backed by the group under Yoest's leadership were measures that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, require women seeking abortions to undergo a sonogram and impose tough regulations on abortion clinics that could lead to their closure."
