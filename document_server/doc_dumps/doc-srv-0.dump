S'Dear Diary: I was at the bank waiting for a teller. A woman in front of me was grumbling that things were taking so long and that all she needed to do was change a $50 bill. I told her I had change for a 50.'

S'Hillary Clinton on Tuesday said she took "absolute personal responsibility" for her losing presidential campaign -- but went on to blame FBI Director James Comey and Russian interference for aiding Republican rival Donald Trump\'s ascension to the presidency. Clinton specifically cited the letter from Comey late in the campaign saying agents were looking into possible new information related to Clinton\'s secret, homebrewed computer server. She was ultimately never charged with a crime, and Comey cleared Clinton on the Sunday before the election.'

S'President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed Tuesday in a phone call that Syrians have suffered "far too long" in the country\'s roughly 6-year-old civil war and agreed to participate in cease-fire negotiations and other humanitarian and de-escalation efforts, according to the White House. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war in which rebel forces are trying to remove President Bashar Assad, whose regime is backed by the Kremlin. Trump recently took a hard line on Assad for using chemical weapons on civilians in rebel territory -- and bombed an airstrip from which the civilian attacks were launched.'
