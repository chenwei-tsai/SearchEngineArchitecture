S'The U.S. government is slacking off on preparing for the next big pandemic or biological terrorism attack and is not only endangering its citizens but also missing out on a great opportunity to score political points, experts said Monday. Protecting the United States from the next pandemic of killer flu, or from a bioterrorist strike, is something Republicans and Democrats can easily agree on, a top congressional appropriator told a biodefense panel.'

The idea was that the more she put herself out there, the more chances she had of getting her work accepted. It was nearing the end of 2015, and she needed to bump up her rejection numbers.'

S"Was our solar system once home to an advanced civilization other than our own - perhaps one that predated humanity by hundreds of millions of years before being wiped out by an asteroid impact or some other cataclysm? There's no evidence for such a pre-human indigenous technological species, though people have been speculating about one since ancient times. But a respected space scientist points out in a provocative new paper that if the existence of home-grown intelligent space aliens has never been established, it's never been ruled out either. And if a race of smart and perhaps spacefaring aliens did make their home in our solar system, traces of their lost civilization might still be out there somewhere in the system just waiting for us to find them. Related: Are Human Beings the Real Ancient Aliens? At least that's what the scientist, Penn State astrophysicist Dr."

Slager is charged in the April 2015 shooting death of Walter Scott, who fled from a traffic stop and resisted arrest. The final moments of their encounter were captured on a bystander's cellphone video that shocked the nation. While the jury was visiting the scene of the shooting on Wednesday morning, Judge Clifton Newman told attorneys he would grant the prosecution's request to let jurors consider manslaughter as well as murder."

The budget agreement, finalized in the wee hours of Monday morning, also defies Trump's demand for cuts to NASA's earth science program, which the administration had targeted as part of a wider promise to cut climate change research. And it provides $103 million to fight the opioid abuse epidemic - an area of rare bipartisan agreement that even Trump supports. The new budget proposal, which needs votes in the House and Senate, would keep the government running until October, when the 2018 budget is supposed to kick in."

Respondents from India, Argentina and Indonesia were most likely to say that men now had more parenting duties, while those from Russia were least likely to agree.

S'If an anti-Donald Trump wave is coming, House Democrats want to be ready to catch it. So they\'re sending hundreds of operatives to school in a massive training operation that they say is bigger and starting earlier than anything the party has attempted before. Over 1,300 aspiring campaign managers, field directors, and finance chiefs have so far enrolled in what the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is calling "DCCC-University." Like "American Idol" for political junkies, students who show the most promise in each of the cities will be invited to a more advanced course in Washington, D.'

S'Michael Slager, the officer who faced murder and manslaughter charges for shooting an unarmed black man in the back, will face a re-trial after the jury deadlocked over his case on Monday - and experts say there\'s still a strong case against him. While eleven jurors backed convicting an officer for the shooting at one point, according to a note written by one of the jurors, a holdout juror said he felt he could not vote to convict the officer in "good conscience." Prosecutors swiftly announced they would re-try the case, which is a legal option after any jury deadlocks. "We will try Michael Slager again," said Scarlett Wilson, the prosecutor in the case.'

S'Jim DeMint has resigned as leader of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, the group\'s board of trustees announced Tuesday -- confirming widespread reports that the former South Carolina GOP senator was being removed. Chairman Thomas A. Saunders III said the board requested DeMint\'s resignation by unanimous vote and has elected Heritage founder Ed Feulner as interim president and chief executive officer. READ THE STATEMENT In a blistering, roughly 500-word statement, Saunders said the decision followed a "comprehensive and independent review" of the entire organization and that the board had found "significant and worsening management issues that led to a breakdown of internal communications and cooperation.'

The FBI documents confirm the imam was under bureau surveillance as part of the "IT UBL/Al-Qaeda" investigation, but the information was not shared with the Defense Department\'s Office of General Counsel, which sponsored the 2002 Pentagon lunch. The high-level FBI surveillance - including specialized teams, as well as video and photos - also calls into question the bureau\'s explanation regarding a decision eight months later, in October 2002, by FBI agent Wade Ammerman.\xc2\xa0While Awlaki was held by Customs officers at JFK airport because of an outstanding warrant for the cleric\'s arrest from the Joint Terrorism Task Force in San Diego, Ammerman told Customs to release him.'

S'It went beyond the deadline but the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers came to terms on a new contract early Tuesday, defusing the threat of a strike crippling the film and television industry. The sides shook hands 90 minutes after the previous contract expiration deadline passed. The WGA had vowed to strike Tuesday if a deal was not in place. The guild\'s instant "pencils down" policy had meant that shows that work on a quick-turnaround - notably day-time soap operas and late-night talk programs like "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" and "Jimmy Kimmel Live" - would be out of topical material immediately.'

The officer, identified as Roy Oliver, a six-year veteran of the Balch Springs Police Department in suburban Dallas, "violated several departmental policies," the department said. Police Chief Jonathon Haber told reporters he couldn\'t specify what policies were violated because Oliver can appeal his firing. Jordan, a high school freshman, was killed Saturday night when police fired multiple rifle rounds at the vehicle he was in with his older brother and other teenagers.'

S'The director of the beleaguered Shreveport VA hospital in Louisiana has been fired following a three-year tenure filled with scandal -- including accusations of covering up a secret wait-list, creating severe staffing shortages and refusing to buy essentials like vital signs machines, linens or mattresses. Toby Mathew, who became director of Overton Brooks VA Medical Center in June 2014, was fired on April 13 due to "charges related to general misconduct, and failure to follow policy and provide effective oversight of the Center\'s credentialing and privileging program," said an internal VA memo obtained by Fox News. This is the highest-profile employee removal since Secretary Eric Shinseki left in May 2014 following news of the massive wait-list scandal at the Phoenix VA hospital. Last week, President Trump signed an executive order creating an office within the VA to make it easier to fire bad employees - an issue that Sen.'

According to court papers filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the three men - Johan Antney, 26, of Queens, and Dashawn Tejada, 26, and Shaqueel Walker, 25, both of Brooklyn - drove in separate vehicles to the CityScapes Gentlemen\'s Club in the Maspeth section of Queens, early on Dec. 30, 2015.

S'The Trump administration\'s single-page tax plan might be light on details, but tax experts say it\'s likely that upper-middle-class families, especially those living in blue states, could take a hit, even as the wealthiest Americans get a windfall. "Nineteen bullet points don\'t make a tax plan," said Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Tax experts echoed the futility of trying to make projections - or, for average Americans, trying to plan their financial futures - without any detailed insight into what parts of the tax code might change. For instance, Trump\'s economic team said it wants to replace the current tax brackets with just three, at 10, 25 and 35 percent, but didn\'t provide income parameters.'
