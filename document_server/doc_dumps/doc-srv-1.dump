S'EXCLUSIVE:\xc2\xa0New files obtained through a federal lawsuit show, for the first time, FBI surveillance images of American-born radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki on the same day he spoke at a Pentagon lunch to promote post-9/11 outreach to the Muslim community. The FBI documents confirm the imam was under bureau surveillance as part of the "IT UBL/Al-Qaeda" investigation, but the information was not shared with the Defense Department\'s Office of General Counsel, which sponsored the 2002 Pentagon lunch. The high-level FBI surveillance - including specialized teams, as well as video and photos - also calls into question the bureau\'s explanation regarding a decision eight months later, in October 2002, by FBI agent Wade Ammerman.'
